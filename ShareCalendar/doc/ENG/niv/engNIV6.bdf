40Mt 1:1 A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham£º
40Mt 1:2 Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,
40Mt 1:3 Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram,
40Mt 1:4 Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,
40Mt 1:5 Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,
40Mt 1:6 and Jesse the father of King David. David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife,
40Mt 1:7 Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa,
40Mt 1:8 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah,
40Mt 1:9 Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah,
40Mt 1:10 Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,
40Mt 1:11 and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.
40Mt 1:12 After the exile to Babylon£º Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,
40Mt 1:13 Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor,
40Mt 1:14 Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Eliud,
40Mt 1:15 Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,
40Mt 1:16 and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
40Mt 1:17 Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.
40Mt 1:18 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about£º His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
40Mt 1:19 Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
40Mt 1:20 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
40Mt 1:21 She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."
40Mt 1:22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet£º
40Mt 1:23 "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel"--which means, "God with us."
40Mt 1:24 When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.
40Mt 1:25 But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.
40Mt 2:1 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem
40Mt 2:2 and asked, "Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
40Mt 2:3 When King Herod heard this he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.
40Mt 2:4 When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born.
40Mt 2:5 "In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written£º
40Mt 2:6 "'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.'"
40Mt 2:7 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
40Mt 2:8 He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship him."
40Mt 2:9 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.
40Mt 2:10 When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.
40Mt 2:11 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.
40Mt 2:12 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.
40Mt 2:13 When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
40Mt 2:14 So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt,
40Mt 2:15 where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet£º "Out of Egypt I called my son."
40Mt 2:16 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.
40Mt 2:17 Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled£º
40Mt 2:18 "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."
40Mt 2:19 After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt
40Mt 2:20 and said, "Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to take the child's life are dead."
40Mt 2:21 So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
40Mt 2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,
40Mt 2:23 and he went and lived in a town called Nazareth. So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets£º "He will be called a Nazarene."
40Mt 3:1 In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the Desert of Judea
40Mt 3:2 and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
40Mt 3:3 This is he who was spoken of through the prophet Isaiah£º "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"
40Mt 3:4 John's clothes were made of camel's hair, and he had a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey.
40Mt 3:5 People went out to him from Jerusalem and all Judea and the whole region of the Jordan.
40Mt 3:6 Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
40Mt 3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them£º "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
40Mt 3:8 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.
40Mt 3:9 And do not think you can say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
40Mt 3:10 The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
40Mt 3:11 "I baptize you with water for repentance. But after me will come one who is more powerful than I, whose sandals I am not fit to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
40Mt 3:12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
40Mt 3:13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
40Mt 3:14 But John tried to deter him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"
40Mt 3:15 Jesus replied, "Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness." Then John consented.
40Mt 3:16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him.
40Mt 3:17 And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
40Mt 4:1 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil.
40Mt 4:2 After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.
40Mt 4:3 The tempter came to him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread."
40Mt 4:4 Jesus answered, "It is written£º 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"
40Mt 4:5 Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
40Mt 4:6 "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written£º "'He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
40Mt 4:7 Jesus answered him, "It is also written£º 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
40Mt 4:8 Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
40Mt 4:9 "All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me."
40Mt 4:10 Jesus said to him, "Away from me, Satan! For it is written£º 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"
40Mt 4:11 Then the devil left him, and angels came and attended him.
40Mt 4:12 When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he returned to Galilee.
40Mt 4:13 Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum, which was by the lake in the area of Zebulun and Naphtali--
40Mt 4:14 to fulfill what was said through the prophet Isaiah£º
40Mt 4:15 "Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, along the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles--
40Mt 4:16 the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned."
40Mt 4:17 From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near."
40Mt 4:18 As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
40Mt 4:19 "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
40Mt 4:20 At once they left their nets and followed him.
40Mt 4:21 Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, preparing their nets. Jesus called them,
40Mt 4:22 and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
40Mt 4:23 Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.
40Mt 4:24 News about him spread all over Syria, and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering severe pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and he healed them.
40Mt 4:25 Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea and the region across the Jordan followed him.
40Mt 5:1 Now when he saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His disciples came to him,
40Mt 5:2 and he began to teach them, saying£º
40Mt 5:3 "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 5:4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
40Mt 5:5 Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
40Mt 5:6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.
40Mt 5:7 Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
40Mt 5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
40Mt 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.
40Mt 5:10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 5:11 "Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me.
40Mt 5:12 Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
40Mt 5:13 "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men.
40Mt 5:14 "You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
40Mt 5:15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
40Mt 5:16 In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.
40Mt 5:17 "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.
40Mt 5:18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
40Mt 5:19 Anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 5:20 For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 5:21 "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.'
40Mt 5:22 But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, 'Raca,' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.
40Mt 5:23 "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,
40Mt 5:24 leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
40Mt 5:25 "Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still with him on the way, or he may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.
40Mt 5:26 I tell you the truth, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.
40Mt 5:27 "You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.'
40Mt 5:28 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
40Mt 5:29 If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
40Mt 5:30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.
40Mt 5:31 "It has been said, 'Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.'
40Mt 5:32 But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.
40Mt 5:33 "Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break your oath, but keep the oaths you have made to the Lord.'
40Mt 5:34 But I tell you, Do not swear at all£º either by heaven, for it is God's throne;
40Mt 5:35 or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.
40Mt 5:36 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.
40Mt 5:37 Simply let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one.
40Mt 5:38 "You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'
40Mt 5:39 But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.
40Mt 5:40 And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.
40Mt 5:41 If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.
40Mt 5:42 Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.
40Mt 5:43 "You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'
40Mt 5:44 But I tell you£º Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
40Mt 5:45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
40Mt 5:46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
40Mt 5:47 And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?
40Mt 5:48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
40Mt 6:1 "Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
40Mt 6:2 "So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.
40Mt 6:3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
40Mt 6:4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40Mt 6:5 "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.
40Mt 6:6 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40Mt 6:7 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.
40Mt 6:8 Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
40Mt 6:9 "This, then, is how you should pray£º "'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name,
40Mt 6:10 your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
40Mt 6:11 Give us today our daily bread.
40Mt 6:12 Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.
40Mt 6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'
40Mt 6:14 For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
40Mt 6:15 But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.
40Mt 6:16 "When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.
40Mt 6:17 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
40Mt 6:18 so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
40Mt 6:19 "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
40Mt 6:20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.
40Mt 6:21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
40Mt 6:22 "The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.
40Mt 6:23 But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!
40Mt 6:24 "No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.
40Mt 6:25 "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?
40Mt 6:26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?
40Mt 6:27 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?
40Mt 6:28 "And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin.
40Mt 6:29 Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
40Mt 6:30 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
40Mt 6:31 So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
40Mt 6:32 For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
40Mt 6:33 But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
40Mt 6:34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
40Mt 7:1 "Do not judge, or you too will be judged.
40Mt 7:2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
40Mt 7:3 "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
40Mt 7:4 How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?
40Mt 7:5 You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
40Mt 7:6 "Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.
40Mt 7:7 "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
40Mt 7:8 For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.
40Mt 7:9 "Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?
40Mt 7:10 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?
40Mt 7:11 If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!
40Mt 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.
40Mt 7:13 "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.
40Mt 7:14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.
40Mt 7:15 "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.
40Mt 7:16 By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
40Mt 7:17 Likewise every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.
40Mt 7:18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.
40Mt 7:19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
40Mt 7:20 Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.
40Mt 7:21 "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
40Mt 7:22 Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?'
40Mt 7:23 Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'
40Mt 7:24 "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
40Mt 7:25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.
40Mt 7:26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
40Mt 7:27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash."
40Mt 7:28 When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,
40Mt 7:29 because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.
40Mt 8:1 When he came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him.
40Mt 8:2 A man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
40Mt 8:3 Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" Immediately he was cured of his leprosy.
40Mt 8:4 Then Jesus said to him, "See that you don't tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
40Mt 8:5 When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help.
40Mt 8:6 "Lord," he said, "my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering."
40Mt 8:7 Jesus said to him, "I will go and heal him."
40Mt 8:8 The centurion replied, "Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
40Mt 8:9 For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
40Mt 8:10 When Jesus heard this, he was astonished and said to those following him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.
40Mt 8:11 I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 8:12 But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40Mt 8:13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go! It will be done just as you believed it would." And his servant was healed at that very hour.
40Mt 8:14 When Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.
40Mt 8:15 He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.
40Mt 8:16 When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.
40Mt 8:17 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah£º "He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases."
40Mt 8:18 When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake.
40Mt 8:19 Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
40Mt 8:20 Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
40Mt 8:21 Another disciple said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
40Mt 8:22 But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
40Mt 8:23 Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him.
40Mt 8:24 Without warning, a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
40Mt 8:25 The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"
40Mt 8:26 He replied, "You of little faith, why are you so afraid?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm.
40Mt 8:27 The men were amazed and asked, "What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!"
40Mt 8:28 When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.
40Mt 8:29 "What do you want with us, Son of God?" they shouted. "Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?"
40Mt 8:30 Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.
40Mt 8:31 The demons begged Jesus, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs."
40Mt 8:32 He said to them, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water.
40Mt 8:33 Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
40Mt 8:34 Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region.
40Mt 9:1 Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town.
40Mt 9:2 Some men brought to him a paralytic, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven."
40Mt 9:3 At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming!"
40Mt 9:4 Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, "Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?
40Mt 9:5 Which is easier£º to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
40Mt 9:6 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. . . ." Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, take your mat and go home."
40Mt 9:7 And the man got up and went home.
40Mt 9:8 When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to men.
40Mt 9:9 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him.
40Mt 9:10 While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" came and ate with him and his disciples.
40Mt 9:11 When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
40Mt 9:12 On hearing this, Jesus said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
40Mt 9:13 But go and learn what this means£º 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
40Mt 9:14 Then John's disciples came and asked him, "How is it that we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"
40Mt 9:15 Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.
40Mt 9:16 "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.
40Mt 9:17 Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."
40Mt 9:18 While he was saying this, a ruler came and knelt before him and said, "My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live."
40Mt 9:19 Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples.
40Mt 9:20 Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.
40Mt 9:21 She said to herself, "If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed."
40Mt 9:22 Jesus turned and saw her. "Take heart, daughter," he said, "your faith has healed you." And the woman was healed from that moment.
40Mt 9:23 When Jesus entered the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,
40Mt 9:24 he said, "Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep." But they laughed at him.
40Mt 9:25 After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.
40Mt 9:26 News of this spread through all that region.
40Mt 9:27 As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40Mt 9:28 When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" "Yes, Lord," they replied.
40Mt 9:29 Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith will it be done to you";
40Mt 9:30 and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, "See that no one knows about this."
40Mt 9:31 But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region.
40Mt 9:32 While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus.
40Mt 9:33 And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel."
40Mt 9:34 But the Pharisees said, "It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons."
40Mt 9:35 Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness.
40Mt 9:36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
40Mt 9:37 Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.
40Mt 9:38 Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."
40Mt 10:1 He called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness.
40Mt 10:2 These are the names of the twelve apostles£º first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
40Mt 10:3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
40Mt 10:4 Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
40Mt 10:5 These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions£º "Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.
40Mt 10:6 Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.
40Mt 10:7 As you go, preach this message£º 'The kingdom of heaven is near.'
40Mt 10:8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.
40Mt 10:9 Do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts;
40Mt 10:10 take no bag for the journey, or extra tunic, or sandals or a staff; for the worker is worth his keep.
40Mt 10:11 "Whatever town or village you enter, search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave.
40Mt 10:12 As you enter the home, give it your greeting.
40Mt 10:13 If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.
40Mt 10:14 If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.
40Mt 10:15 I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.
40Mt 10:16 I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.
40Mt 10:17 "Be on your guard against men; they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues.
40Mt 10:18 On my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.
40Mt 10:19 But when they arrest you, do not worry about what to say or how to say it. At that time you will be given what to say,
40Mt 10:20 for it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
40Mt 10:21 "Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
40Mt 10:22 All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
40Mt 10:23 When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.
40Mt 10:24 "A student is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.
40Mt 10:25 It is enough for the student to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebub, how much more the members of his household!
40Mt 10:26 "So do not be afraid of them. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.
40Mt 10:27 What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the roofs.
40Mt 10:28 Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.
40Mt 10:29 Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.
40Mt 10:30 And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
40Mt 10:31 So don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
40Mt 10:32 "Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.
40Mt 10:33 But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.
40Mt 10:34 "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
40Mt 10:35 For I have come to turn "'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--
40Mt 10:36 a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.'
40Mt 10:37 "Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me;
40Mt 10:38 and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.
40Mt 10:39 Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
40Mt 10:40 "He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives the one who sent me.
40Mt 10:41 Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.
40Mt 10:42 And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward."
40Mt 11:1 After Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of Galilee.
40Mt 11:2 When John heard in prison what Christ was doing, he sent his disciples
40Mt 11:3 to ask him, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?"
40Mt 11:4 Jesus replied, "Go back and report to John what you hear and see£º
40Mt 11:5 The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
40Mt 11:6 Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me."
40Mt 11:7 As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John£º "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
40Mt 11:8 If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces.
40Mt 11:9 Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
40Mt 11:10 This is the one about whom it is written£º "'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
40Mt 11:11 I tell you the truth£º Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40Mt 11:12 From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and forceful men lay hold of it.
40Mt 11:13 For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.
40Mt 11:14 And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who was to come.
40Mt 11:15 He who has ears, let him hear.
40Mt 11:16 "To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others£º
40Mt 11:17 "'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'
40Mt 11:18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'
40Mt 11:19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and "sinners." 'But wisdom is proved right by her actions."
40Mt 11:20 Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.
40Mt 11:21 "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
40Mt 11:22 But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.
40Mt 11:23 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
40Mt 11:24 But I tell you that it will be more bearable for Sodom on the day of judgment than for you."
40Mt 11:25 At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.
40Mt 11:26 Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.
40Mt 11:27 "All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
40Mt 11:28 "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
40Mt 11:29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
40Mt 11:30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
40Mt 12:1 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them.
40Mt 12:2 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath."
40Mt 12:3 He answered, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
40Mt 12:4 He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread--which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.
40Mt 12:5 Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent?
40Mt 12:6 I tell you that one greater than the temple is here.
40Mt 12:7 If you had known what these words mean, 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.
40Mt 12:8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
40Mt 12:9 Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue,
40Mt 12:10 and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?"
40Mt 12:11 He said to them, "If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?
40Mt 12:12 How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath."
40Mt 12:13 Then he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.
40Mt 12:14 But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.
40Mt 12:15 Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. Many followed him, and he healed all their sick,
40Mt 12:16 warning them not to tell who he was.
40Mt 12:17 This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah£º
40Mt 12:18 "Here is my servant whom I have chosen, the one I love, in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
40Mt 12:19 He will not quarrel or cry out; no one will hear his voice in the streets.
40Mt 12:20 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out, till he leads justice to victory.
40Mt 12:21 In his name the nations will put their hope."
40Mt 12:22 Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see.
40Mt 12:23 All the people were astonished and said, "Could this be the Son of David?"
40Mt 12:24 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this fellow drives out demons."
40Mt 12:25 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
40Mt 12:26 If Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?
40Mt 12:27 And if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your people drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
40Mt 12:28 But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
40Mt 12:29 "Or again, how can anyone enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can rob his house.
40Mt 12:30 "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.
40Mt 12:31 And so I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
40Mt 12:32 Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.
40Mt 12:33 "Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.
40Mt 12:34 You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks.
40Mt 12:35 The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.
40Mt 12:36 But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken.
40Mt 12:37 For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned."
40Mt 12:38 Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you."
40Mt 12:39 He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40Mt 12:40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
40Mt 12:41 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.
40Mt 12:42 The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here.
40Mt 12:43 "When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.
40Mt 12:44 Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean and put in order.
40Mt 12:45 Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation."
40Mt 12:46 While Jesus was still talking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
40Mt 12:47 Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you."
40Mt 12:48 He replied to him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
40Mt 12:49 Pointing to his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers.
40Mt 12:50 For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."
40Mt 13:1 That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake.
40Mt 13:2 Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore.
40Mt 13:3 Then he told them many things in parables, saying£º "A farmer went out to sow his seed.
40Mt 13:4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
40Mt 13:5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.
40Mt 13:6 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.
40Mt 13:7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.
40Mt 13:8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop--a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.
40Mt 13:9 He who has ears, let him hear."
40Mt 13:10 The disciples came to him and asked, "Why do you speak to the people in parables?"
40Mt 13:11 He replied, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.
40Mt 13:12 Whoever has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
40Mt 13:13 This is why I speak to them in parables£º "Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.
40Mt 13:14 In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah£º "'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.
40Mt 13:15 For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.'
40Mt 13:16 But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.
40Mt 13:17 For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.
40Mt 13:18 "Listen then to what the parable of the sower means£º
40Mt 13:19 When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is the seed sown along the path.
40Mt 13:20 The one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.
40Mt 13:21 But since he has no root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, he quickly falls away.
40Mt 13:22 The one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it, making it unfruitful.
40Mt 13:23 But the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it. He produces a crop, yielding a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown."
40Mt 13:24 Jesus told them another parable£º "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.
40Mt 13:25 But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.
40Mt 13:26 When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.
40Mt 13:27 "The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'
40Mt 13:28 "'An enemy did this,' he replied. "The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'
40Mt 13:29 "'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may root up the wheat with them.
40Mt 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters£º First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"
40Mt 13:31 He told them another parable£º "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.
40Mt 13:32 Though it is the smallest of all your seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches."
40Mt 13:33 He told them still another parable£º "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough."
40Mt 13:34 Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable.
40Mt 13:35 So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet£º "I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world."
40Mt 13:36 Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field."
40Mt 13:37 He answered, "The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.
40Mt 13:38 The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,
40Mt 13:39 and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.
40Mt 13:40 "As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.
40Mt 13:41 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
40Mt 13:42 They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 13:43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.
40Mt 13:44 "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.
40Mt 13:45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.
40Mt 13:46 When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.
40Mt 13:47 "Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.
40Mt 13:48 When it was full, the fishermen pulled it up on the shore. Then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets, but threw the bad away.
40Mt 13:49 This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
40Mt 13:50 and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 13:51 "Have you understood all these things?" Jesus asked. "Yes," they replied.
40Mt 13:52 He said to them, "Therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old."
40Mt 13:53 When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.
40Mt 13:54 Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?" they asked.
40Mt 13:55 "Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?
40Mt 13:56 Aren't all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?"
40Mt 13:57 And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, "Only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor."
40Mt 13:58 And he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith.
40Mt 14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus,
40Mt 14:2 and he said to his attendants, "This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
40Mt 14:3 Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife,
40Mt 14:4 for John had been saying to him£º "It is not lawful for you to have her."
40Mt 14:5 Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered him a prophet.
40Mt 14:6 On Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for them and pleased Herod so much
40Mt 14:7 that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.
40Mt 14:8 Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist."
40Mt 14:9 The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted
40Mt 14:10 and had John beheaded in the prison.
40Mt 14:11 His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother.
40Mt 14:12 John's disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
40Mt 14:13 When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns.
40Mt 14:14 When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
40Mt 14:15 As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food."
40Mt 14:16 Jesus replied, "They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat."
40Mt 14:17 "We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered.
40Mt 14:18 "Bring them here to me," he said.
40Mt 14:19 And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.
40Mt 14:20 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
40Mt 14:21 The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children.
40Mt 14:22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd.
40Mt 14:23 After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,
40Mt 14:24 but the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.
40Mt 14:25 During the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake.
40Mt 14:26 When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. "It's a ghost," they said, and cried out in fear.
40Mt 14:27 But Jesus immediately said to them£º "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."
40Mt 14:28 "Lord, if it's you," Peter replied, "tell me to come to you on the water."
40Mt 14:29 "Come," he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus.
40Mt 14:30 But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, "Lord, save me!"
40Mt 14:31 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. "You of little faith," he said, "why did you doubt?"
40Mt 14:32 And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down.
40Mt 14:33 Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God."
40Mt 14:34 When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.
40Mt 14:35 And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him
40Mt 14:36 and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.
40Mt 15:1 Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,
40Mt 15:2 "Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands before they eat!"
40Mt 15:3 Jesus replied, "And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?
40Mt 15:4 For God said, 'Honor your father and mother' and 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'
40Mt 15:5 But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to God,'
40Mt 15:6 he is not to 'honor his father' with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.
40Mt 15:7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you£º
40Mt 15:8 "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
40Mt 15:9 They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'"
40Mt 15:10 Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen and understand.
40Mt 15:11 What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.'"
40Mt 15:12 Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?"
40Mt 15:13 He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.
40Mt 15:14 Leave them; they are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit."
40Mt 15:15 Peter said, "Explain the parable to us."
40Mt 15:16 "Are you still so dull?" Jesus asked them.
40Mt 15:17 "Don't you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?
40Mt 15:18 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these make a man 'unclean.'
40Mt 15:19 For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.
40Mt 15:20 These are what make a man 'unclean'; but eating with unwashed hands does not make him 'unclean.'"
40Mt 15:21 Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
40Mt 15:22 A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon-possession."
40Mt 15:23 Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, "Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us."
40Mt 15:24 He answered, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel."
40Mt 15:25 The woman came and knelt before him. "Lord, help me!" she said.
40Mt 15:26 He replied, "It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."
40Mt 15:27 "Yes, Lord," she said, "but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table."
40Mt 15:28 Then Jesus answered, "Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted." And her daughter was healed from that very hour.
40Mt 15:29 Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.
40Mt 15:30 Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.
40Mt 15:31 The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.
40Mt 15:32 Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way."
40Mt 15:33 His disciples answered, "Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?"
40Mt 15:34 "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied, "and a few small fish."
40Mt 15:35 He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.
40Mt 15:36 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.
40Mt 15:37 They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
40Mt 15:38 The number of those who ate was four thousand, besides women and children.
40Mt 15:39 After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan.
40Mt 16:1 The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven.
40Mt 16:2 He replied, "When evening comes, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,'
40Mt 16:3 and in the morning, 'Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.
40Mt 16:4 A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah." Jesus then left them and went away.
40Mt 16:5 When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread.
40Mt 16:6 "Be careful," Jesus said to them. "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40Mt 16:7 They discussed this among themselves and said, "It is because we didn't bring any bread."
40Mt 16:8 Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, "You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?
40Mt 16:9 Do you still not understand? Don't you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?
40Mt 16:10 Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?
40Mt 16:11 How is it you don't understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40Mt 16:12 Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
40Mt 16:13 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?"
40Mt 16:14 They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
40Mt 16:15 "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?"
40Mt 16:16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
40Mt 16:17 Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven.
40Mt 16:18 And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it.
40Mt 16:19 I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."
40Mt 16:20 Then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.
40Mt 16:21 From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.
40Mt 16:22 Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. "Never, Lord!" he said. "This shall never happen to you!"
40Mt 16:23 Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."
40Mt 16:24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
40Mt 16:25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it.
40Mt 16:26 What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
40Mt 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father's glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what he has done.
40Mt 16:28 I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom."
40Mt 17:1 After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
40Mt 17:2 There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.
40Mt 17:3 Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.
40Mt 17:4 Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."
40Mt 17:5 While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!"
40Mt 17:6 When the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified.
40Mt 17:7 But Jesus came and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
40Mt 17:8 When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.
40Mt 17:9 As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus instructed them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen, until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."
40Mt 17:10 The disciples asked him, "Why then do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
40Mt 17:11 Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.
40Mt 17:12 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands."
40Mt 17:13 Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.
40Mt 17:14 When they came to the crowd, a man approached Jesus and knelt before him.
40Mt 17:15 "Lord, have mercy on my son," he said. "He has seizures and is suffering greatly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
40Mt 17:16 I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him."
40Mt 17:17 "O unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me."
40Mt 17:18 Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of the boy, and he was healed from that moment.
40Mt 17:19 Then the disciples came to Jesus in private and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
40Mt 17:20 He replied, "Because you have so little faith. I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you."
40Mt 17:21 But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.
40Mt 17:22 When they came together in Galilee, he said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.
40Mt 17:23 They will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised to life." And the disciples were filled with grief.
40Mt 17:24 After Jesus and his disciples arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma tax came to Peter and asked, "Doesn't your teacher pay the temple tax?"
40Mt 17:25 "Yes, he does," he replied. When Peter came into the house, Jesus was the first to speak. "What do you think, Simon?" he asked. "From whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes--from their own sons or from others?"
40Mt 17:26 "From others," Peter answered. "Then the sons are exempt," Jesus said to him.
40Mt 17:27 "But so that we may not offend them, go to the lake and throw out your line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours."
40Mt 18:1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
40Mt 18:2 He called a little child and had him stand among them.
40Mt 18:3 And he said£º "I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 18:4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 18:5 "And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.
40Mt 18:6 But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
40Mt 18:7 "Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin! Such things must come, but woe to the man through whom they come!
40Mt 18:8 If your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
40Mt 18:9 And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.
40Mt 18:10 "See that you do not look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my Father in heaven.
40Mt 18:11 The Son of Man came to save what was lost.
40Mt 18:12 "What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off?
40Mt 18:13 And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety-nine that did not wander off.
40Mt 18:14 In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost.
40Mt 18:15 "If your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over.
40Mt 18:16 But if he will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'
40Mt 18:17 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector.
40Mt 18:18 "I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.
40Mt 18:19 "Again, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven.
40Mt 18:20 For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them."
40Mt 18:21 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, "Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother when he sins against me? Up to seven times?"
40Mt 18:22 Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.
40Mt 18:23 "Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
40Mt 18:24 As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.
40Mt 18:25 Since he was not able to pay, the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt.
40Mt 18:26 "The servant fell on his knees before him. 'Be patient with me,' he begged, 'and I will pay back everything.'
40Mt 18:27 The servant's master took pity on him, canceled the debt and let him go.
40Mt 18:28 "But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him and began to choke him. 'Pay back what you owe me!' he demanded.
40Mt 18:29 "His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'
40Mt 18:30 "But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt.
40Mt 18:31 When the other servants saw what had happened, they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened.
40Mt 18:32 "Then the master called the servant in. 'You wicked servant,' he said, 'I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to.
40Mt 18:33 Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?'
40Mt 18:34 In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.
40Mt 18:35 "This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart."
40Mt 19:1 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went into the region of Judea to the other side of the Jordan.
40Mt 19:2 Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
40Mt 19:3 Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?"
40Mt 19:4 "Haven't you read," he replied, "that at the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female,'
40Mt 19:5 and said, 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh'?
40Mt 19:6 So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."
40Mt 19:7 "Why then," they asked, "did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?"
40Mt 19:8 Jesus replied, "Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.
40Mt 19:9 I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery."
40Mt 19:10 The disciples said to him, "If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry."
40Mt 19:11 Jesus replied, "Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.
40Mt 19:12 For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it."
40Mt 19:13 Then little children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
40Mt 19:14 Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."
40Mt 19:15 When he had placed his hands on them, he went on from there.
40Mt 19:16 Now a man came up to Jesus and asked, "Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?"
40Mt 19:17 "Why do you ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, obey the commandments."
40Mt 19:18 "Which ones?" the man inquired. Jesus replied, "'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,
40Mt 19:19 honor your father and mother,' and 'love your neighbor as yourself.'"
40Mt 19:20 "All these I have kept," the young man said. "What do I still lack?"
40Mt 19:21 Jesus answered, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
40Mt 19:22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.
40Mt 19:23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 19:24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
40Mt 19:25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?"
40Mt 19:26 Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."
40Mt 19:27 Peter answered him, "We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?"
40Mt 19:28 Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
40Mt 19:29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
40Mt 19:30 But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.
40Mt 20:1 "For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard.
40Mt 20:2 He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.
40Mt 20:3 "About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.
40Mt 20:4 He told them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.'
40Mt 20:5 So they went. "He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing.
40Mt 20:6 About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, 'Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'
40Mt 20:7 "'Because no one has hired us,' they answered. "He said to them, 'You also go and work in my vineyard.'
40Mt 20:8 "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'
40Mt 20:9 "The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.
40Mt 20:10 So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.
40Mt 20:11 When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.
40Mt 20:12 'These men who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, 'and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'
40Mt 20:13 "But he answered one of them, 'Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius?
40Mt 20:14 Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you.
40Mt 20:15 Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?'
40Mt 20:16 "So the last will be first, and the first will be last."
40Mt 20:17 Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them,
40Mt 20:18 "We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death
40Mt 20:19 and will turn him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified. On the third day he will be raised to life!"
40Mt 20:20 Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him.
40Mt 20:21 "What is it you want?" he asked. She said, "Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom."
40Mt 20:22 "You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said to them. "Can you drink the cup I am going to drink?" "We can," they answered.
40Mt 20:23 Jesus said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father."
40Mt 20:24 When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers.
40Mt 20:25 Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
40Mt 20:26 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
40Mt 20:27 and whoever wants to be first must be your slave--
40Mt 20:28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
40Mt 20:29 As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
40Mt 20:30 Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
40Mt 20:31 The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the louder, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
40Mt 20:32 Jesus stopped and called them. "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
40Mt 20:33 "Lord," they answered, "we want our sight."
40Mt 20:34 Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.
40Mt 21:1 As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
40Mt 21:2 saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her. Untie them and bring them to me.
40Mt 21:3 If anyone says anything to you, tell him that the Lord needs them, and he will send them right away."
40Mt 21:4 This took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet£º
40Mt 21:5 "Say to the Daughter of Zion, 'See, your king comes to you, gentle and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.'"
40Mt 21:6 The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
40Mt 21:7 They brought the donkey and the colt, placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.
40Mt 21:8 A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
40Mt 21:9 The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Hosanna in the highest!"
40Mt 21:10 When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
40Mt 21:11 The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."
40Mt 21:12 Jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.
40Mt 21:13 "It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be called a house of prayer,' but you are making it a 'den of robbers.'"
40Mt 21:14 The blind and the lame came to him at the temple, and he healed them.
40Mt 21:15 But when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they were indignant.
40Mt 21:16 "Do you hear what these children are saying?" they asked him. "Yes," replied Jesus, "have you never read, "'From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise'?"
40Mt 21:17 And he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
40Mt 21:18 Early in the morning, as he was on his way back to the city, he was hungry.
40Mt 21:19 Seeing a fig tree by the road, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" Immediately the tree withered.
40Mt 21:20 When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?" they asked.
40Mt 21:21 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only can you do what was done to the fig tree, but also you can say to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and it will be done.
40Mt 21:22 If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."
40Mt 21:23 Jesus entered the temple courts, and, while he was teaching, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him. "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you this authority?"
40Mt 21:24 Jesus replied, "I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
40Mt 21:25 John's baptism--where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?" They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
40Mt 21:26 But if we say, 'From men'--we are afraid of the people, for they all hold that John was a prophet."
40Mt 21:27 So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Then he said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
40Mt 21:28 "What do you think? There was a man who had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work today in the vineyard.'
40Mt 21:29 "'I will not,' he answered, but later he changed his mind and went.
40Mt 21:30 "Then the father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, 'I will, sir,' but he did not go.
40Mt 21:31 "Which of the two did what his father wanted?" "The first," they answered. Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God ahead of you.
40Mt 21:32 For John came to you to show you the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after you saw this, you did not repent and believe him.
40Mt 21:33 "Listen to another parable£º There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.
40Mt 21:34 When the harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit.
40Mt 21:35 "The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.
40Mt 21:36 Then he sent other servants to them, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way.
40Mt 21:37 Last of all, he sent his son to them. 'They will respect my son,' he said.
40Mt 21:38 "But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him and take his inheritance.'
40Mt 21:39 So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
40Mt 21:40 "Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?"
40Mt 21:41 "He will bring those wretches to a wretched end," they replied, "and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time."
40Mt 21:42 Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures£º "'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone; the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?
40Mt 21:43 "Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit.
40Mt 21:44 He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed."
40Mt 21:45 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus' parables, they knew he was talking about them.
40Mt 21:46 They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet.
40Mt 22:1 Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying£º
40Mt 22:2 "The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.
40Mt 22:3 He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.
40Mt 22:4 "Then he sent some more servants and said, 'Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner£º My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.'
40Mt 22:5 "But they paid no attention and went off--one to his field, another to his business.
40Mt 22:6 The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.
40Mt 22:7 The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.
40Mt 22:8 "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.
40Mt 22:9 Go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.'
40Mt 22:10 So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, both good and bad, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.
40Mt 22:11 "But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
40Mt 22:12 'Friend,' he asked, 'how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' The man was speechless.
40Mt 22:13 "Then the king told the attendants, 'Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40Mt 22:14 "For many are invited, but few are chosen."
40Mt 22:15 Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words.
40Mt 22:16 They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. "Teacher," they said, "we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are.
40Mt 22:17 Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
40Mt 22:18 But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, "You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?
40Mt 22:19 Show me the coin used for paying the tax." They brought him a denarius,
40Mt 22:20 and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?"
40Mt 22:21 "Caesar's," they replied. Then he said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
40Mt 22:22 When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.
40Mt 22:23 That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.
40Mt 22:24 "Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him.
40Mt 22:25 Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother.
40Mt 22:26 The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh.
40Mt 22:27 Finally, the woman died.
40Mt 22:28 Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"
40Mt 22:29 Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.
40Mt 22:30 At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.
40Mt 22:31 But about the resurrection of the dead--have you not read what God said to you,
40Mt 22:32 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."
40Mt 22:33 When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
40Mt 22:34 Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.
40Mt 22:35 One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question£º
40Mt 22:36 "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?"
40Mt 22:37 Jesus replied£º "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.'
40Mt 22:38 This is the first and greatest commandment.
40Mt 22:39 And the second is like it£º 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'
40Mt 22:40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments."
40Mt 22:41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
40Mt 22:42 "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" "The son of David," they replied.
40Mt 22:43 He said to them, "How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him 'Lord'? For he says,
40Mt 22:44 "'The Lord said to my Lord£º "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet." '
40Mt 22:45 If then David calls him 'Lord,' how can he be his son?"
40Mt 22:46 No one could say a word in reply, and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions.
40Mt 23:1 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples£º
40Mt 23:2 "The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.
40Mt 23:3 So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach.
40Mt 23:4 They tie up heavy loads and put them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.
40Mt 23:5 "Everything they do is done for men to see£º They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;
40Mt 23:6 they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues;
40Mt 23:7 they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them 'Rabbi.'
40Mt 23:8 "But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' for you have only one Master and you are all brothers.
40Mt 23:9 And do not call anyone on earth 'father,' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven.
40Mt 23:10 Nor are you to be called 'teacher,' for you have one Teacher, the Christ.
40Mt 23:11 The greatest among you will be your servant.
40Mt 23:12 For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.
40Mt 23:13 "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men's faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.
40Mt 23:14 "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Therefore you will be punished more severely.
40Mt 23:15 "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.
40Mt 23:16 "Woe to you, blind guides! You say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.'
40Mt 23:17 You blind fools! Which is greater£º the gold, or the temple that makes the gold sacred?
40Mt 23:18 You also say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.'
40Mt 23:19 You blind men! Which is greater£º the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
40Mt 23:20 Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
40Mt 23:21 And he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it.
40Mt 23:22 And he who swears by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.
40Mt 23:23 "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill and cummin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former.
40Mt 23:24 You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.
40Mt 23:25 "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
40Mt 23:26 Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean.
40Mt 23:27 "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything unclean.
40Mt 23:28 In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
40Mt 23:29 "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.
40Mt 23:30 And you say, 'If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
40Mt 23:31 So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
40Mt 23:32 Fill up, then, the measure of the sin of your forefathers!
40Mt 23:33 "You snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?
40Mt 23:34 Therefore I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town.
40Mt 23:35 And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.
40Mt 23:36 I tell you the truth, all this will come upon this generation.
40Mt 23:37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.
40Mt 23:38 Look, your house is left to you desolate.
40Mt 23:39 For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"
40Mt 24:1 Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.
40Mt 24:2 "Do you see all these things?" he asked. "I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
40Mt 24:3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?"
40Mt 24:4 Jesus answered£º "Watch out that no one deceives you.
40Mt 24:5 For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ,' and will deceive many.
40Mt 24:6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.
40Mt 24:7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
40Mt 24:8 All these are the beginning of birth pains.
40Mt 24:9 "Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me.
40Mt 24:10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other,
40Mt 24:11 and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.
40Mt 24:12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold,
40Mt 24:13 but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
40Mt 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.
40Mt 24:15 "So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation,' spoken of through the prophet Daniel--let the reader understand--
40Mt 24:16 then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
40Mt 24:17 Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house.
40Mt 24:18 Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.
40Mt 24:19 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
40Mt 24:20 Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath.
40Mt 24:21 For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now--and never to be equaled again.
40Mt 24:22 If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.
40Mt 24:23 At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it.
40Mt 24:24 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect--if that were possible.
40Mt 24:25 See, I have told you ahead of time.
40Mt 24:26 "So if anyone tells you, 'There he is, out in the desert,' do not go out; or, 'Here he is, in the inner rooms,' do not believe it.
40Mt 24:27 For as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
40Mt 24:28 Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.
40Mt 24:29 "Immediately after the distress of those days "'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'
40Mt 24:30 "At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory.
40Mt 24:31 And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.
40Mt 24:32 "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree£º As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
40Mt 24:33 Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.
40Mt 24:34 I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
40Mt 24:35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
40Mt 24:36 "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
40Mt 24:37 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
40Mt 24:38 For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark;
40Mt 24:39 and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
40Mt 24:40 Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
40Mt 24:41 Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.
40Mt 24:42 "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.
40Mt 24:43 But understand this£º If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into.
40Mt 24:44 So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.
40Mt 24:45 "Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time?
40Mt 24:46 It will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.
40Mt 24:47 I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
40Mt 24:48 But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, 'My master is staying away a long time,'
40Mt 24:49 and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.
40Mt 24:50 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.
40Mt 24:51 He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 25:1 "At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
40Mt 25:2 Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
40Mt 25:3 The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.
40Mt 25:4 The wise, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps.
40Mt 25:5 The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
40Mt 25:6 "At midnight the cry rang out£º 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'
40Mt 25:7 "Then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps.
40Mt 25:8 The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.'
40Mt 25:9 "'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'
40Mt 25:10 "But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
40Mt 25:11 "Later the others also came. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!'
40Mt 25:12 "But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, I don't know you.'
40Mt 25:13 "Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.
40Mt 25:14 "Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
40Mt 25:15 To one he gave five talents of money, to another two talents, and to another one talent, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.
40Mt 25:16 The man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more.
40Mt 25:17 So also, the one with the two talents gained two more.
40Mt 25:18 But the man who had received the one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.
40Mt 25:19 "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
40Mt 25:20 The man who had received the five talents brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.'
40Mt 25:21 "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'
40Mt 25:22 "The man with the two talents also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.'
40Mt 25:23 "His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'
40Mt 25:24 "Then the man who had received the one talent came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.
40Mt 25:25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'
40Mt 25:26 "His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?
40Mt 25:27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.
40Mt 25:28 "'Take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents.
40Mt 25:29 For everyone who has will be given more, and he will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.
40Mt 25:30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40Mt 25:31 "When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory.
40Mt 25:32 All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
40Mt 25:33 He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
40Mt 25:34 "Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world.
40Mt 25:35 For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in,
40Mt 25:36 I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.'
40Mt 25:37 "Then the righteous will answer him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?
40Mt 25:38 When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you?
40Mt 25:39 When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?'
40Mt 25:40 "The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'
40Mt 25:41 "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.
40Mt 25:42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,
40Mt 25:43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.'
40Mt 25:44 "They also will answer, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?'
40Mt 25:45 "He will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.'
40Mt 25:46 "Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."
40Mt 26:1 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
40Mt 26:2 "As you know, the Passover is two days away--and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."
40Mt 26:3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,
40Mt 26:4 and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him.
40Mt 26:5 "But not during the Feast," they said, "or there may be a riot among the people."
40Mt 26:6 While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper,
40Mt 26:7 a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table.
40Mt 26:8 When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. "Why this waste?" they asked.
40Mt 26:9 "This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor."
40Mt 26:10 Aware of this, Jesus said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
40Mt 26:11 The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have me.
40Mt 26:12 When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
40Mt 26:13 I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."
40Mt 26:14 Then one of the Twelve--the one called Judas Iscariot--went to the chief priests
40Mt 26:15 and asked, "What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?" So they counted out for him thirty silver coins.
40Mt 26:16 From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
40Mt 26:17 On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
40Mt 26:18 He replied, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says£º My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.'"
40Mt 26:19 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.
40Mt 26:20 When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.
40Mt 26:21 And while they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."
40Mt 26:22 They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, "Surely not I, Lord?"
40Mt 26:23 Jesus replied, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.
40Mt 26:24 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
40Mt 26:25 Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus answered, "Yes, it is you."
40Mt 26:26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat; this is my body."
40Mt 26:27 Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.
40Mt 26:28 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
40Mt 26:29 I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father's kingdom."
40Mt 26:30 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
40Mt 26:31 Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written£º "'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
40Mt 26:32 But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
40Mt 26:33 Peter replied, "Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will."
40Mt 26:34 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times."
40Mt 26:35 But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same.
40Mt 26:36 Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "Sit here while I go over there and pray."
40Mt 26:37 He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
40Mt 26:38 Then he said to them, "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
40Mt 26:39 Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will."
40Mt 26:40 Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?" he asked Peter.
40Mt 26:41 "Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."
40Mt 26:42 He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done."
40Mt 26:43 When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.
40Mt 26:44 So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
40Mt 26:45 Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
40Mt 26:46 Rise, let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"
40Mt 26:47 While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
40Mt 26:48 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them£º "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."
40Mt 26:49 Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
40Mt 26:50 Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you came for."Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.
40Mt 26:51 With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
40Mt 26:52 "Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.
40Mt 26:53 Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
40Mt 26:54 But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?"
40Mt 26:55 At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.
40Mt 26:56 But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
40Mt 26:57 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
40Mt 26:58 But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
40Mt 26:59 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
40Mt 26:60 But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward
40Mt 26:61 and declared, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
40Mt 26:62 Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
40Mt 26:63 But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God£º Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
40Mt 26:64 "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied. "But I say to all of you£º In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
40Mt 26:65 Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.
40Mt 26:66 What do you think?" "He is worthy of death," they answered.
40Mt 26:67 Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him
40Mt 26:68 and said, "Prophesy to us, Christ. Who hit you?"
40Mt 26:69 Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
40Mt 26:70 But he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
40Mt 26:71 Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."
40Mt 26:72 He denied it again, with an oath£º "I don't know the man!"
40Mt 26:73 After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away."
40Mt 26:74 Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.
40Mt 26:75 Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken£º "Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
40Mt 27:1 Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death.
40Mt 27:2 They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
40Mt 27:3 When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.
40Mt 27:4 "I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood." "What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility."
40Mt 27:5 So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
40Mt 27:6 The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."
40Mt 27:7 So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.
40Mt 27:8 That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
40Mt 27:9 Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled£º "They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
40Mt 27:10 and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."
40Mt 27:11 Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
40Mt 27:12 When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.
40Mt 27:13 Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"
40Mt 27:14 But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge--to the great amazement of the governor.
40Mt 27:15 Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.
40Mt 27:16 At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
40Mt 27:17 So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you£º Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
40Mt 27:18 For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.
40Mt 27:19 While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message£º "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."
40Mt 27:20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
40Mt 27:21 "Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
40Mt 27:22 "What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
40Mt 27:23 "Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
40Mt 27:24 When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
40Mt 27:25 All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"
40Mt 27:26 Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
40Mt 27:27 Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.
40Mt 27:28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
40Mt 27:29 and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!" they said.
40Mt 27:30 They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
40Mt 27:31 After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.
40Mt 27:32 As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.
40Mt 27:33 They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).
40Mt 27:34 There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
40Mt 27:35 When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
40Mt 27:36 And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.
40Mt 27:37 Above his head they placed the written charge against him£º THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
40Mt 27:38 Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
40Mt 27:39 Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads
40Mt 27:40 and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
40Mt 27:41 In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
40Mt 27:42 "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
40Mt 27:43 He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
40Mt 27:44 In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
40Mt 27:45 From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.
40Mt 27:46 About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
40Mt 27:47 When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."
40Mt 27:48 Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
40Mt 27:49 The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
40Mt 27:50 And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
40Mt 27:51 At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.
40Mt 27:52 The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
40Mt 27:53 They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
40Mt 27:54 When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!"
40Mt 27:55 Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
40Mt 27:56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
40Mt 27:57 As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
40Mt 27:58 Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
40Mt 27:59 Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
40Mt 27:60 and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.
40Mt 27:61 Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
40Mt 27:62 The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
40Mt 27:63 "Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.'
40Mt 27:64 So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."
40Mt 27:65 "Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."
40Mt 27:66 So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
40Mt 28:1 After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
40Mt 28:2 There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.
40Mt 28:3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
40Mt 28:4 The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
40Mt 28:5 The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
40Mt 28:6 He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.
40Mt 28:7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples£º 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you."
40Mt 28:8 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
40Mt 28:9 Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him.
40Mt 28:10 Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me."
40Mt 28:11 While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.
40Mt 28:12 When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money,
40Mt 28:13 telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.'
40Mt 28:14 If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."
40Mt 28:15 So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day.
40Mt 28:16 Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
40Mt 28:17 When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted.
40Mt 28:18 Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
40Mt 28:19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
40Mt 28:20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."
41
41Mk 1:1 The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
41Mk 1:2 It is written in Isaiah the prophet£º "I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way"--
41Mk 1:3 "a voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'"
41Mk 1:4 And so John came, baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
41Mk 1:5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
41Mk 1:6 John wore clothing made of camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
41Mk 1:7 And this was his message£º "After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
41Mk 1:8 I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."
41Mk 1:9 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
41Mk 1:10 As Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
41Mk 1:11 And a voice came from heaven£º "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
41Mk 1:12 At once the Spirit sent him out into the desert,
41Mk 1:13 and he was in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.
41Mk 1:14 After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
41Mk 1:15 "The time has come," he said. "The kingdom of God is near. Repent and believe the good news!"
41Mk 1:16 As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen.
41Mk 1:17 "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will make you fishers of men."
41Mk 1:18 At once they left their nets and followed him.
41Mk 1:19 When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets.
41Mk 1:20 Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
41Mk 1:21 They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
41Mk 1:22 The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law.
41Mk 1:23 Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out,
41Mk 1:24 "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"
41Mk 1:25 "Be quiet!" said Jesus sternly. "Come out of him!"
41Mk 1:26 The evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
41Mk 1:27 The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this? A new teaching--and with authority! He even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him."
41Mk 1:28 News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.
41Mk 1:29 As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.
41Mk 1:30 Simon's mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they told Jesus about her.
41Mk 1:31 So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them.
41Mk 1:32 That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed.
41Mk 1:33 The whole town gathered at the door,
41Mk 1:34 and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was.
41Mk 1:35 Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed.
41Mk 1:36 Simon and his companions went to look for him,
41Mk 1:37 and when they found him, they exclaimed£º "Everyone is looking for you!"
41Mk 1:38 Jesus replied, "Let us go somewhere else--to the nearby villages--so I can preach there also. That is why I have come."
41Mk 1:39 So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.
41Mk 1:40 A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
41Mk 1:41 Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!"
41Mk 1:42 Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured.
41Mk 1:43 Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning£º
41Mk 1:44 "See that you don't tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."
41Mk 1:45 Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
41Mk 2:1 A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home.
41Mk 2:2 So many gathered that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them.
41Mk 2:3 Some men came, bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.
41Mk 2:4 Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus and, after digging through it, lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on.
41Mk 2:5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
41Mk 2:6 Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
41Mk 2:7 "Why does this fellow talk like that? He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
41Mk 2:8 Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, "Why are you thinking these things?
41Mk 2:9 Which is easier£º to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, take your mat and walk'?
41Mk 2:10 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. . . ." He said to the paralytic,
41Mk 2:11 "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."
41Mk 2:12 He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"
41Mk 2:13 Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.
41Mk 2:14 As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector's booth. "Follow me," Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.
41Mk 2:15 While Jesus was having dinner at Levi's house, many tax collectors and "sinners" were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
41Mk 2:16 When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the "sinners" and tax collectors, they asked his disciples£º "Why does he eat with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
41Mk 2:17 On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
41Mk 2:18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, "How is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?"
41Mk 2:19 Jesus answered, "How can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.
41Mk 2:20 But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.
41Mk 2:21 "No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
41Mk 2:22 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wineskins."
41Mk 2:23 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain.
41Mk 2:24 The Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"
41Mk 2:25 He answered, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?
41Mk 2:26 In the days of Abiathar the high priest, he entered the house of God and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."
41Mk 2:27 Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
41Mk 2:28 So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."
41Mk 3:1 Another time he went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there.
41Mk 3:2 Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath.
41Mk 3:3 Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Stand up in front of everyone."
41Mk 3:4 Then Jesus asked them, "Which is lawful on the Sabbath£º to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?" But they remained silent.
41Mk 3:5 He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored.
41Mk 3:6 Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.
41Mk 3:7 Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed.
41Mk 3:8 When they heard all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon.
41Mk 3:9 Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him.
41Mk 3:10 For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him.
41Mk 3:11 Whenever the evil spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."
41Mk 3:12 But he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was.
41Mk 3:13 Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him.
41Mk 3:14 He appointed twelve--designating them apostles--that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach
41Mk 3:15 and to have authority to drive out demons.
41Mk 3:16 These are the twelve he appointed£º Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);
41Mk 3:17 James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means Sons of Thunder);
41Mk 3:18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot
41Mk 3:19 and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.
41Mk 3:20 Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat.
41Mk 3:21 When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."
41Mk 3:22 And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons."
41Mk 3:23 So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables£º "How can Satan drive out Satan?
41Mk 3:24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
41Mk 3:25 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.
41Mk 3:26 And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.
41Mk 3:27 In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house.
41Mk 3:28 I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them.
41Mk 3:29 But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin."
41Mk 3:30 He said this because they were saying, "He has an evil spirit."
41Mk 3:31 Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him.
41Mk 3:32 A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, "Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you."
41Mk 3:33 "Who are my mother and my brothers?" he asked.
41Mk 3:34 Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
41Mk 3:35 Whoever does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."
41Mk 4:1 Again Jesus began to teach by the lake. The crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake, while all the people were along the shore at the water's edge.
41Mk 4:2 He taught them many things by parables, and in his teaching said£º
41Mk 4:3 "Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.
41Mk 4:4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.
41Mk 4:5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.
41Mk 4:6 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.
41Mk 4:7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, so that they did not bear grain.
41Mk 4:8 Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times."
41Mk 4:9 Then Jesus said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
41Mk 4:10 When he was alone, the Twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables.
41Mk 4:11 He told them, "The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables
41Mk 4:12 so that, "'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'"
41Mk 4:13 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?
41Mk 4:14 The farmer sows the word.
41Mk 4:15 Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.
41Mk 4:16 Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy.
41Mk 4:17 But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.
41Mk 4:18 Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word;
41Mk 4:19 but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.
41Mk 4:20 Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop--thirty, sixty or even a hundred times what was sown."
41Mk 4:21 He said to them, "Do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed? Instead, don't you put it on its stand?
41Mk 4:22 For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open.
41Mk 4:23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."
41Mk 4:24 "Consider carefully what you hear," he continued. "With the measure you use, it will be measured to you--and even more.
41Mk 4:25 Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him."
41Mk 4:26 He also said, "This is what the kingdom of God is like. A man scatters seed on the ground.
41Mk 4:27 Night and day, whether he sleeps or gets up, the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.
41Mk 4:28 All by itself the soil produces grain--first the stalk, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.
41Mk 4:29 As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come."
41Mk 4:30 Again he said, "What shall we say the kingdom of God is like, or what parable shall we use to describe it?
41Mk 4:31 It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground.
41Mk 4:32 Yet when planted, it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade."
41Mk 4:33 With many similar parables Jesus spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.
41Mk 4:34 He did not say anything to them without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.
41Mk 4:35 That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."
41Mk 4:36 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.
41Mk 4:37 A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat, so that it was nearly swamped.
41Mk 4:38 Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"
41Mk 4:39 He got up, rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Quiet! Be still!" Then the wind died down and it was completely calm.
41Mk 4:40 He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
41Mk 4:41 They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!"
41Mk 5:1 They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.
41Mk 5:2 When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him.
41Mk 5:3 This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him any more, not even with a chain.
41Mk 5:4 For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
41Mk 5:5 Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones.
41Mk 5:6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him.
41Mk 5:7 He shouted at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Swear to God that you won't torture me!"
41Mk 5:8 For Jesus had said to him, "Come out of this man, you evil spirit!"
41Mk 5:9 Then Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "My name is Legion," he replied, "for we are many."
41Mk 5:10 And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area.
41Mk 5:11 A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.
41Mk 5:12 The demons begged Jesus, "Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them."
41Mk 5:13 He gave them permission, and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.
41Mk 5:14 Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened.
41Mk 5:15 When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
41Mk 5:16 Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man--and told about the pigs as well.
41Mk 5:17 Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.
41Mk 5:18 As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.
41Mk 5:19 Jesus did not let him, but said, "Go home to your family and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."
41Mk 5:20 So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.
41Mk 5:21 When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake.
41Mk 5:22 Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came there. Seeing Jesus, he fell at his feet
41Mk 5:23 and pleaded earnestly with him, "My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live."
41Mk 5:24 So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around him.
41Mk 5:25 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.
41Mk 5:26 She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.
41Mk 5:27 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak,
41Mk 5:28 because she thought, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed."
41Mk 5:29 Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.
41Mk 5:30 At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"
41Mk 5:31 "You see the people crowding against you," his disciples answered, "and yet you can ask, 'Who touched me?'"
41Mk 5:32 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.
41Mk 5:33 Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth.
41Mk 5:34 He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering."
41Mk 5:35 While Jesus was still speaking, some men came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," they said. "Why bother the teacher any more?"
41Mk 5:36 Ignoring what they said, Jesus told the synagogue ruler, "Don't be afraid; just believe."
41Mk 5:37 He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James.
41Mk 5:38 When they came to the home of the synagogue ruler, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.
41Mk 5:39 He went in and said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep."
41Mk 5:40 But they laughed at him. After he put them all out, he took the child's father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was.
41Mk 5:41 He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum!" (which means, "Little girl, I say to you, get up!").
41Mk 5:42 Immediately the girl stood up and walked around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.
41Mk 5:43 He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
41Mk 6:1 Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.
41Mk 6:2 When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. "Where did this man get these things?" they asked. "What's this wisdom that has been given him, that he even does miracles!
41Mk 6:3 Isn't this the carpenter? Isn't this Mary's son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Aren't his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.
41Mk 6:4 Jesus said to them, "Only in his hometown, among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor."
41Mk 6:5 He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.
41Mk 6:6 And he was amazed at their lack of faith. Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village.
41Mk 6:7 Calling the Twelve to him, he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits.
41Mk 6:8 These were his instructions£º "Take nothing for the journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.
41Mk 6:9 Wear sandals but not an extra tunic.
41Mk 6:10 Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.
41Mk 6:11 And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave, as a testimony against them."
41Mk 6:12 They went out and preached that people should repent.
41Mk 6:13 They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.
41Mk 6:14 King Herod heard about this, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some were saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him."
41Mk 6:15 Others said, "He is Elijah." And still others claimed, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago."
41Mk 6:16 But when Herod heard this, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!"
41Mk 6:17 For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married.
41Mk 6:18 For John had been saying to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
41Mk 6:19 So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to,
41Mk 6:20 because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled; yet he liked to listen to him.
41Mk 6:21 Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
41Mk 6:22 When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."
41Mk 6:23 And he promised her with an oath, "Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom."
41Mk 6:24 She went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of John the Baptist," she answered.
41Mk 6:25 At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request£º "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
41Mk 6:26 The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her.
41Mk 6:27 So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison,
41Mk 6:28 and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.
41Mk 6:29 On hearing of this, John's disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.
41Mk 6:30 The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught.
41Mk 6:31 Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, "Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest."
41Mk 6:32 So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place.
41Mk 6:33 But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
41Mk 6:34 When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
41Mk 6:35 By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. "This is a remote place," they said, "and it's already very late.
41Mk 6:36 Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat."
41Mk 6:37 But he answered, "You give them something to eat." They said to him, "That would take eight months of a man's wages! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?"
41Mk 6:38 "How many loaves do you have?" he asked. "Go and see." When they found out, they said, "Five--and two fish."
41Mk 6:39 Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.
41Mk 6:40 So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
41Mk 6:41 Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
41Mk 6:42 They all ate and were satisfied,
41Mk 6:43 and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish.
41Mk 6:44 The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand.
41Mk 6:45 Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.
41Mk 6:46 After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray.
41Mk 6:47 When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land.
41Mk 6:48 He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them,
41Mk 6:49 but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out,
41Mk 6:50 because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."
41Mk 6:51 Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed,
41Mk 6:52 for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened.
41Mk 6:53 When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there.
41Mk 6:54 As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus.
41Mk 6:55 They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.
41Mk 6:56 And wherever he went--into villages, towns or countryside--they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him were healed.
41Mk 7:1 The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus and
41Mk 7:2 saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were "unclean," that is, unwashed.
41Mk 7:3 (The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders.
41Mk 7:4 When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.)
41Mk 7:5 So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with 'unclean' hands?"
41Mk 7:6 He replied, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written£º "'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
41Mk 7:7 They worship me in vain; their teachings are but rules taught by men.'
41Mk 7:8 You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men."
41Mk 7:9 And he said to them£º "You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!
41Mk 7:10 For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'
41Mk 7:11 But you say that if a man says to his father or mother£º 'Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban' (that is, a gift devoted to God),
41Mk 7:12 then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.
41Mk 7:13 Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that."
41Mk 7:14 Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.
41Mk 7:15 Nothing outside a man can make him 'unclean' by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him 'unclean.'"
41Mk 7:16 If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.
41Mk 7:17 After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.
41Mk 7:18 "Are you so dull?" he asked. "Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'?
41Mk 7:19 For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body." (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods "clean.")
41Mk 7:20 He went on£º "What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.'
41Mk 7:21 For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,
41Mk 7:22 greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.
41Mk 7:23 All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean.'"
41Mk 7:24 Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret.
41Mk 7:25 In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet.
41Mk 7:26 The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter.
41Mk 7:27 "First let the children eat all they want," he told her, "for it is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs."
41Mk 7:28 "Yes, Lord," she replied, "but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."
41Mk 7:29 Then he told her, "For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter."
41Mk 7:30 She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.
41Mk 7:31 Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.
41Mk 7:32 There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged him to place his hand on the man.
41Mk 7:33 After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man's ears. Then he spit and touched the man's tongue.
41Mk 7:34 He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, "Ephphatha!" (which means, "Be opened!").
41Mk 7:35 At this, the man's ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.
41Mk 7:36 Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it.
41Mk 7:37 People were overwhelmed with amazement. "He has done everything well," they said. "He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."
41Mk 8:1 During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said,
41Mk 8:2 "I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.
41Mk 8:3 If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance."
41Mk 8:4 His disciples answered, "But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?"
41Mk 8:5 "How many loaves do you have?" Jesus asked. "Seven," they replied.
41Mk 8:6 He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people, and they did so.
41Mk 8:7 They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them.
41Mk 8:8 The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
41Mk 8:9 About four thousand men were present. And having sent them away,
41Mk 8:10 he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
41Mk 8:11 The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven.
41Mk 8:12 He sighed deeply and said, "Why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to it."
41Mk 8:13 Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.
41Mk 8:14 The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.
41Mk 8:15 "Be careful," Jesus warned them. "Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod."
41Mk 8:16 They discussed this with one another and said, "It is because we have no bread."
41Mk 8:17 Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them£º "Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?
41Mk 8:18 Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don't you remember?
41Mk 8:19 When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" "Twelve," they replied.
41Mk 8:20 "And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?" They answered, "Seven."
41Mk 8:21 He said to them, "Do you still not understand?"
41Mk 8:22 They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him.
41Mk 8:23 He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man's eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, "Do you see anything?"
41Mk 8:24 He looked up and said, "I see people; they look like trees walking around."
41Mk 8:25 Once more Jesus put his hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.
41Mk 8:26 Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't go into the village."
41Mk 8:27 Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"
41Mk 8:28 They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets."
41Mk 8:29 "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "You are the Christ."
41Mk 8:30 Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
41Mk 8:31 He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.
41Mk 8:32 He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
41Mk 8:33 But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. "Get behind me, Satan!" he said. "You do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men."
41Mk 8:34 Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said£º "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
41Mk 8:35 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.
41Mk 8:36 What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?
41Mk 8:37 Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
41Mk 8:38 If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."
41Mk 9:1 And he said to them, "I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."
41Mk 9:2 After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them.
41Mk 9:3 His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.
41Mk 9:4 And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.
41Mk 9:5 Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah."
41Mk 9:6 (He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)
41Mk 9:7 Then a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and a voice came from the cloud£º "This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!"
41Mk 9:8 Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
41Mk 9:9 As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
41Mk 9:10 They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what "rising from the dead" meant.
41Mk 9:11 And they asked him, "Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?"
41Mk 9:12 Jesus replied, "To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?
41Mk 9:13 But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him."
41Mk 9:14 When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them.
41Mk 9:15 As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him.
41Mk 9:16 "What are you arguing with them about?" he asked.
41Mk 9:17 A man in the crowd answered, "Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech.
41Mk 9:18 Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not."
41Mk 9:19 "O unbelieving generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me."
41Mk 9:20 So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.
41Mk 9:21 Jesus asked the boy's father, "How long has he been like this?" "From childhood," he answered.
41Mk 9:22 "It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us."
41Mk 9:23 "'If you can'?" said Jesus. "Everything is possible for him who believes."
41Mk 9:24 Immediately the boy's father exclaimed, "I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!"
41Mk 9:25 When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the evil spirit. "You deaf and mute spirit," he said, "I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."
41Mk 9:26 The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, "He's dead."
41Mk 9:27 But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up.
41Mk 9:28 After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
41Mk 9:29 He replied, "This kind can come out only by prayer."
41Mk 9:30 They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were,
41Mk 9:31 because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise."
41Mk 9:32 But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.
41Mk 9:33 They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, "What were you arguing about on the road?"
41Mk 9:34 But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest.
41Mk 9:35 Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, "If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all."
41Mk 9:36 He took a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them,
41Mk 9:37 "Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me."
41Mk 9:38 "Teacher," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us."
41Mk 9:39 "Do not stop him," Jesus said. "No one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me,
41Mk 9:40 for whoever is not against us is for us.
41Mk 9:41 I tell you the truth, anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to Christ will certainly not lose his reward.
41Mk 9:42 "And if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck.
41Mk 9:43 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out.
41Mk 9:44 Where "'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'
41Mk 9:45 And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.
41Mk 9:46 Where "'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'
41Mk 9:47 And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,
41Mk 9:48 where "'their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'
41Mk 9:49 Everyone will be salted with fire.
41Mk 9:50 "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with each other."
41Mk 10:1 Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them.
41Mk 10:2 Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?"
41Mk 10:3 "What did Moses command you?" he replied.
41Mk 10:4 They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away."
41Mk 10:5 "It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied.
41Mk 10:6 "But at the beginning of creation God 'made them male and female.'
41Mk 10:7 'For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife,
41Mk 10:8 and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one.
41Mk 10:9 Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate."
41Mk 10:10 When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this.
41Mk 10:11 He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.
41Mk 10:12 And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."
41Mk 10:13 People were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.
41Mk 10:14 When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
41Mk 10:15 I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
41Mk 10:16 And he took the children in his arms, put his hands on them and blessed them.
41Mk 10:17 As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. "Good teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
41Mk 10:18 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.
41Mk 10:19 You know the commandments£º 'Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.'"
41Mk 10:20 "Teacher," he declared, "all these I have kept since I was a boy."
41Mk 10:21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. "One thing you lack," he said. "Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
41Mk 10:22 At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.
41Mk 10:23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!"
41Mk 10:24 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!
41Mk 10:25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
41Mk 10:26 The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, "Who then can be saved?"
41Mk 10:27 Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God."
41Mk 10:28 Peter said to him, "We have left everything to follow you!"
41Mk 10:29 "I tell you the truth," Jesus replied, "no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel
41Mk 10:30 will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age (homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields--and with them, persecutions) and in the age to come, eternal life.
41Mk 10:31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first."
41Mk 10:32 They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him.
41Mk 10:33 "We are going up to Jerusalem," he said, "and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles,
41Mk 10:34 who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise."
41Mk 10:35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do for us whatever we ask."
41Mk 10:36 "What do you want me to do for you?" he asked.
41Mk 10:37 They replied, "Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory."
41Mk 10:38 "You don't know what you are asking," Jesus said. "Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?"
41Mk 10:39 "We can," they answered. Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink and be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with,
41Mk 10:40 but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places belong to those for whom they have been prepared."
41Mk 10:41 When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John.
41Mk 10:42 Jesus called them together and said, "You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.
41Mk 10:43 Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
41Mk 10:44 and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.
41Mk 10:45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."
41Mk 10:46 Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (that is, the Son of Timaeus), was sitting by the roadside begging.
41Mk 10:47 When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41Mk 10:48 Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41Mk 10:49 Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He's calling you."
41Mk 10:50 Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.
41Mk 10:51 "What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him. The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."
41Mk 10:52 "Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.
41Mk 11:1 As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,
41Mk 11:2 saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
41Mk 11:3 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"
41Mk 11:4 They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway. As they untied it,
41Mk 11:5 some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"
41Mk 11:6 They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.
41Mk 11:7 When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it.
41Mk 11:8 Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut in the fields.
41Mk 11:9 Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
41Mk 11:10 "Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!" "Hosanna in the highest!"
41Mk 11:11 Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve.
41Mk 11:12 The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
41Mk 11:13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs.
41Mk 11:14 Then he said to the tree, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again." And his disciples heard him say it.
41Mk 11:15 On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,
41Mk 11:16 and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts.
41Mk 11:17 And as he taught them, he said, "Is it not written£º "'My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"
41Mk 11:18 The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
41Mk 11:19 When evening came, they went out of the city.
41Mk 11:20 In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.
41Mk 11:21 Peter remembered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!"
41Mk 11:22 "Have faith in God," Jesus answered.
41Mk 11:23 "I tell you the truth, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Go, throw yourself into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.
41Mk 11:24 Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.
41Mk 11:25 And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins."
41Mk 11:26 But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your sins.
41Mk 11:27 They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him.
41Mk 11:28 "By what authority are you doing these things?" they asked. "And who gave you authority to do this?"
41Mk 11:29 Jesus replied, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
41Mk 11:30 John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men? Tell me!"
41Mk 11:31 They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
41Mk 11:32 But if we say, 'From men' . . . ." (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.)
41Mk 11:33 So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
41Mk 12:1 He then began to speak to them in parables£º "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey.
41Mk 12:2 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.
41Mk 12:3 But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
41Mk 12:4 Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.
41Mk 12:5 He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.
41Mk 12:6 "He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
41Mk 12:7 "But the tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
41Mk 12:8 So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.
41Mk 12:9 "What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.
41Mk 12:10 Haven't you read this scripture£º "'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone;
41Mk 12:11 the Lord has done this, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"
41Mk 12:12 Then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they were afraid of the crowd; so they left him and went away.
41Mk 12:13 Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words.
41Mk 12:14 They came to him and said, "Teacher, we know you are a man of integrity. You aren't swayed by men, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
41Mk 12:15 Should we pay or shouldn't we?" But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. "Why are you trying to trap me?" he asked. "Bring me a denarius and let me look at it."
41Mk 12:16 They brought the coin, and he asked them, "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?" "Caesar's," they replied.
41Mk 12:17 Then Jesus said to them, "Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's." And they were amazed at him.
41Mk 12:18 Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.
41Mk 12:19 "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.
41Mk 12:20 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.
41Mk 12:21 The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third.
41Mk 12:22 In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.
41Mk 12:23 At the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"
41Mk 12:24 Jesus replied, "Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?
41Mk 12:25 When the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.
41Mk 12:26 Now about the dead rising--have you not read in the book of Moses, in the account of the bush, how God said to him, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?
41Mk 12:27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"
41Mk 12:28 One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"
41Mk 12:29 "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this£º 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
41Mk 12:30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.'
41Mk 12:31 The second is this£º 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these."
41Mk 12:32 "Well said, teacher," the man replied. "You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.
41Mk 12:33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."
41Mk 12:34 When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions.
41Mk 12:35 While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, "How is it that the teachers of the law say that the Christ is the son of David?
41Mk 12:36 David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared£º "'The Lord said to my Lord£º "Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet." '
41Mk 12:37 David himself calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with delight.
41Mk 12:38 As he taught, Jesus said, "Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces,
41Mk 12:39 and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
41Mk 12:40 They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."
41Mk 12:41 Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts.
41Mk 12:42 But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny.
41Mk 12:43 Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others.
41Mk 12:44 They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."
41Mk 13:1 As he was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!"
41Mk 13:2 "Do you see all these great buildings?" replied Jesus. "Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down."
41Mk 13:3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately,
41Mk 13:4 "Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?"
41Mk 13:5 Jesus said to them£º "Watch out that no one deceives you.
41Mk 13:6 Many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and will deceive many.
41Mk 13:7 When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.
41Mk 13:8 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.
41Mk 13:9 "You must be on your guard. You will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues. On account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them.
41Mk 13:10 And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.
41Mk 13:11 Whenever you are arrested and brought to trial, do not worry beforehand about what to say. Just say whatever is given you at the time, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
41Mk 13:12 "Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
41Mk 13:13 All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved.
41Mk 13:14 "When you see 'the abomination that causes desolation' standing where it does not belong--let the reader understand--then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
41Mk 13:15 Let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out.
41Mk 13:16 Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak.
41Mk 13:17 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
41Mk 13:18 Pray that this will not take place in winter,
41Mk 13:19 because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning, when God created the world, until now--and never to be equaled again.
41Mk 13:20 If the Lord had not cut short those days, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, whom he has chosen, he has shortened them.
41Mk 13:21 At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.
41Mk 13:22 For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect--if that were possible.
41Mk 13:23 So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time.
41Mk 13:24 "But in those days, following that distress, "'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;
41Mk 13:25 the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.'
41Mk 13:26 "At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.
41Mk 13:27 And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.
41Mk 13:28 "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree£º As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.
41Mk 13:29 Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.
41Mk 13:30 I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
41Mk 13:31 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
41Mk 13:32 "No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
41Mk 13:33 Be on guard! Be alert! You do not know when that time will come.
41Mk 13:34 It's like a man going away£º He leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his assigned task, and tells the one at the door to keep watch.
41Mk 13:35 "Therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back--whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or at dawn.
41Mk 13:36 If he comes suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.
41Mk 13:37 What I say to you, I say to everyone£º 'Watch!'"
41Mk 14:1 Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest Jesus and kill him.
41Mk 14:2 "But not during the Feast," they said, "or the people may riot."
41Mk 14:3 While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of a man known as Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
41Mk 14:4 Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, "Why this waste of perfume?
41Mk 14:5 It could have been sold for more than a year's wages and the money given to the poor." And they rebuked her harshly.
41Mk 14:6 "Leave her alone," said Jesus. "Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.
41Mk 14:7 The poor you will always have with you, and you can help them any time you want. But you will not always have me.
41Mk 14:8 She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.
41Mk 14:9 I tell you the truth, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her."
41Mk 14:10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them.
41Mk 14:11 They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
41Mk 14:12 On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?"
41Mk 14:13 So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.
41Mk 14:14 Say to the owner of the house he enters, 'The Teacher asks£º Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
41Mk 14:15 He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there."
41Mk 14:16 The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
41Mk 14:17 When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve.
41Mk 14:18 While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me--one who is eating with me."
41Mk 14:19 They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, "Surely not I?"
41Mk 14:20 "It is one of the Twelve," he replied, "one who dips bread into the bowl with me.
41Mk 14:21 The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born."
41Mk 14:22 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take it; this is my body."
41Mk 14:23 Then he took the cup, gave thanks and offered it to them, and they all drank from it.
41Mk 14:24 "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many," he said to them.
41Mk 14:25 "I tell you the truth, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God."
41Mk 14:26 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
41Mk 14:27 "You will all fall away," Jesus told them, "for it is written£º "'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
41Mk 14:28 But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee."
41Mk 14:29 Peter declared, "Even if all fall away, I will not."
41Mk 14:30 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "today--yes, tonight--before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times."
41Mk 14:31 But Peter insisted emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the others said the same.
41Mk 14:32 They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, "Sit here while I pray."
41Mk 14:33 He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled.
41Mk 14:34 "My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death," he said to them. "Stay here and keep watch."
41Mk 14:35 Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him.
41Mk 14:36 "Abba, Father," he said, "everything is possible for you. Take this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will."
41Mk 14:37 Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "Simon," he said to Peter, "are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?
41Mk 14:38 Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak."
41Mk 14:39 Once more he went away and prayed the same thing.
41Mk 14:40 When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him.
41Mk 14:41 Returning the third time, he said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
41Mk 14:42 Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!"
41Mk 14:43 Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.
41Mk 14:44 Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them£º "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard."
41Mk 14:45 Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Rabbi!" and kissed him.
41Mk 14:46 The men seized Jesus and arrested him.
41Mk 14:47 Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
41Mk 14:48 "Am I leading a rebellion," said Jesus, "that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?
41Mk 14:49 Every day I was with you, teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
41Mk 14:50 Then everyone deserted him and fled.
41Mk 14:51 A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,
41Mk 14:52 he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.
41Mk 14:53 They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, elders and teachers of the law came together.
41Mk 14:54 Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire.
41Mk 14:55 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any.
41Mk 14:56 Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree.
41Mk 14:57 Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him£º
41Mk 14:58 "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this man-made temple and in three days will build another, not made by man.'"
41Mk 14:59 Yet even then their testimony did not agree.
41Mk 14:60 Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
41Mk 14:61 But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?"
41Mk 14:62 "I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven."
41Mk 14:63 The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.
41Mk 14:64 "You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?" They all condemned him as worthy of death.
41Mk 14:65 Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, "Prophesy!" And the guards took him and beat him.
41Mk 14:66 While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by.
41Mk 14:67 When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked closely at him. "You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus," she said.
41Mk 14:68 But he denied it. "I don't know or understand what you're talking about," he said, and went out into the entryway.
41Mk 14:69 When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, "This fellow is one of them."
41Mk 14:70 Again he denied it. After a little while, those standing near said to Peter, "Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean."
41Mk 14:71 He began to call down curses on himself, and he swore to them, "I don't know this man you're talking about."
41Mk 14:72 Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him£º "Before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times." And he broke down and wept.
41Mk 15:1 Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.
41Mk 15:2 "Are you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
41Mk 15:3 The chief priests accused him of many things.
41Mk 15:4 So again Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of."
41Mk 15:5 But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed.
41Mk 15:6 Now it was the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested.
41Mk 15:7 A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.
41Mk 15:8 The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did.
41Mk 15:9 "Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate,
41Mk 15:10 knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.
41Mk 15:11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.
41Mk 15:12 "What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?" Pilate asked them.
41Mk 15:13 "Crucify him!" they shouted.
41Mk 15:14 "Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
41Mk 15:15 Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
41Mk 15:16 The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers.
41Mk 15:17 They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.
41Mk 15:18 And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!"
41Mk 15:19 Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.
41Mk 15:20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.
41Mk 15:21 A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross.
41Mk 15:22 They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).
41Mk 15:23 Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.
41Mk 15:24 And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get.
41Mk 15:25 It was the third hour when they crucified him.
41Mk 15:26 The written notice of the charge against him read£º THE KING OF THE JEWS.
41Mk 15:27 They crucified two robbers with him, one on his right and one on his left.
41Mk 15:28 And the scripture was fulfilled which says, "He was counted with the lawless ones."
41Mk 15:29 Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days,
41Mk 15:30 come down from the cross and save yourself!"
41Mk 15:31 In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself!
41Mk 15:32 Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
41Mk 15:33 At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.
41Mk 15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
41Mk 15:35 When some of those standing near heard this, they said, "Listen, he's calling Elijah."
41Mk 15:36 One man ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said.
41Mk 15:37 With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
41Mk 15:38 The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.
41Mk 15:39 And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, "Surely this man was the Son of God!"
41Mk 15:40 Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.
41Mk 15:41 In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.
41Mk 15:42 It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached,
41Mk 15:43 Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
41Mk 15:44 Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died.
41Mk 15:45 When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph.
41Mk 15:46 So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.
41Mk 15:47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.
41Mk 16:1 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body.
41Mk 16:2 Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb
41Mk 16:3 and they asked each other, "Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?"
41Mk 16:4 But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.
41Mk 16:5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
41Mk 16:6 "Don't be alarmed," he said. "You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.
41Mk 16:7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.'"
41Mk 16:8 Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.
41Mk 16:9 When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.
41Mk 16:10 She went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping.
41Mk 16:11 When they heard that Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.
41Mk 16:12 Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country.
41Mk 16:13 These returned and reported it to the rest; but they did not believe them either.
41Mk 16:14 Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
41Mk 16:15 He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation.
41Mk 16:16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.
41Mk 16:17 And these signs will accompany those who believe£º In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
41Mk 16:18 they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well."
41Mk 16:19 After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God.
41Mk 16:20 Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it.
42
42Lk 1:1 Many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,
42Lk 1:2 just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word.
42Lk 1:3 Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
42Lk 1:4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.
42Lk 1:5 In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
42Lk 1:6 Both of them were upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.
42Lk 1:7 But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.
42Lk 1:8 Once when Zechariah's division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,
42Lk 1:9 he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
42Lk 1:10 And when the time for the burning of incense came, all the assembled worshipers were praying outside.
42Lk 1:11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.
42Lk 1:12 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and was gripped with fear.
42Lk 1:13 But the angel said to him£º "Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.
42Lk 1:14 He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice because of his birth,
42Lk 1:15 for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth.
42Lk 1:16 Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God.
42Lk 1:17 And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous--to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."
42Lk 1:18 Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years."
42Lk 1:19 The angel answered, "I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.
42Lk 1:20 And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time."
42Lk 1:21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.
42Lk 1:22 When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized he had seen a vision in the temple, for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.
42Lk 1:23 When his time of service was completed, he returned home.
42Lk 1:24 After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion.
42Lk 1:25 "The Lord has done this for me," she said. "In these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people."
42Lk 1:26 In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,
42Lk 1:27 to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
42Lk 1:28 The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."
42Lk 1:29 Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
42Lk 1:30 But the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God.
42Lk 1:31 You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus.
42Lk 1:32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David,
42Lk 1:33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end."
42Lk 1:34 "How will this be," Mary asked the angel, "since I am a virgin?"
42Lk 1:35 The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God.
42Lk 1:36 Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.
42Lk 1:37 For nothing is impossible with God."
42Lk 1:38 "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered. "May it be to me as you have said." Then the angel left her.
42Lk 1:39 At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea,
42Lk 1:40 where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.
42Lk 1:41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
42Lk 1:42 In a loud voice she exclaimed£º "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear!
42Lk 1:43 But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
42Lk 1:44 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
42Lk 1:45 Blessed is she who has believed that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!"
42Lk 1:46 And Mary said£º "My soul glorifies the Lord
42Lk 1:47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
42Lk 1:48 for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed,
42Lk 1:49 for the Mighty One has done great things for me--holy is his name.
42Lk 1:50 His mercy extends to those who fear him, from generation to generation.
42Lk 1:51 He has performed mighty deeds with his arm; he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
42Lk 1:52 He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.
42Lk 1:53 He has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty.
42Lk 1:54 He has helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful
42Lk 1:55 to Abraham and his descendants forever, even as he said to our fathers."
42Lk 1:56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
42Lk 1:57 When it was time for Elizabeth to have her baby, she gave birth to a son.
42Lk 1:58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they shared her joy.
42Lk 1:59 On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were going to name him after his father Zechariah,
42Lk 1:60 but his mother spoke up and said, "No! He is to be called John."
42Lk 1:61 They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who has that name."
42Lk 1:62 Then they made signs to his father, to find out what he would like to name the child.
42Lk 1:63 He asked for a writing tablet, and to everyone's astonishment he wrote, "His name is John."
42Lk 1:64 Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed, and he began to speak, praising God.
42Lk 1:65 The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judea people were talking about all these things.
42Lk 1:66 Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?" For the Lord's hand was with him.
42Lk 1:67 His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied£º
42Lk 1:68 "Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has come and has redeemed his people.
42Lk 1:69 He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David
42Lk 1:70 (as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
42Lk 1:71 salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us--
42Lk 1:72 to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant,
42Lk 1:73 the oath he swore to our father Abraham£º
42Lk 1:74 to rescue us from the hand of our enemies, and to enable us to serve him without fear
42Lk 1:75 in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
42Lk 1:76 And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
42Lk 1:77 to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,
42Lk 1:78 because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
42Lk 1:79 to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace."
42Lk 1:80 And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to Israel.
42Lk 2:1 In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
42Lk 2:2 (This was the first census that took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.)
42Lk 2:3 And everyone went to his own town to register.
42Lk 2:4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
42Lk 2:5 He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
42Lk 2:6 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,
42Lk 2:7 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
42Lk 2:8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
42Lk 2:9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
42Lk 2:10 But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
42Lk 2:11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.
42Lk 2:12 This will be a sign to you£º You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."
42Lk 2:13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,
42Lk 2:14 "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."
42Lk 2:15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."
42Lk 2:16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger.
42Lk 2:17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child,
42Lk 2:18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.
42Lk 2:19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.
42Lk 2:20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.
42Lk 2:21 On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived.
42Lk 2:22 When the time of their purification according to the Law of Moses had been completed, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
42Lk 2:23 (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord"),
42Lk 2:24 and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord£º "a pair of doves or two young pigeons."
42Lk 2:25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
42Lk 2:26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
42Lk 2:27 Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,
42Lk 2:28 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying£º
42Lk 2:29 "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace.
42Lk 2:30 For my eyes have seen your salvation,
42Lk 2:31 which you have prepared in the sight of all people,
42Lk 2:32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel."
42Lk 2:33 The child's father and mother marveled at what was said about him.
42Lk 2:34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother£º "This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against,
42Lk 2:35 so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."
42Lk 2:36 There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
42Lk 2:37 and then was a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying.
42Lk 2:38 Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem.
42Lk 2:39 When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.
42Lk 2:40 And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.
42Lk 2:41 Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.
42Lk 2:42 When he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.
42Lk 2:43 After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.
42Lk 2:44 Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends.
42Lk 2:45 When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him.
42Lk 2:46 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.
42Lk 2:47 Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers.
42Lk 2:48 When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."
42Lk 2:49 "Why were you searching for me?" he asked. "Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?"
42Lk 2:50 But they did not understand what he was saying to them.
42Lk 2:51 Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart.
42Lk 2:52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.
42Lk 3:1 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar--when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene--
42Lk 3:2 during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert.
42Lk 3:3 He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
42Lk 3:4 As is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet£º "A voice of one calling in the desert, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.
42Lk 3:5 Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight, the rough ways smooth.
42Lk 3:6 And all mankind will see God's salvation.'"
42Lk 3:7 John said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
42Lk 3:8 Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I tell you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham.
42Lk 3:9 The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire."
42Lk 3:10 "What should we do then?" the crowd asked.
42Lk 3:11 John answered, "The man with two tunics should share with him who has none, and the one who has food should do the same."
42Lk 3:12 Tax collectors also came to be baptized. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?"
42Lk 3:13 "Don't collect any more than you are required to," he told them.
42Lk 3:14 Then some soldiers asked him, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Don't extort money and don't accuse people falsely--be content with your pay."
42Lk 3:15 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Christ.
42Lk 3:16 John answered them all, "I baptize you with water. But one more powerful than I will come, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
42Lk 3:17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire."
42Lk 3:18 And with many other words John exhorted the people and preached the good news to them.
42Lk 3:19 But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother's wife, and all the other evil things he had done,
42Lk 3:20 Herod added this to them all£º He locked John up in prison.
42Lk 3:21 When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he was praying, heaven was opened
42Lk 3:22 and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven£º "You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
42Lk 3:23 Now Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the son, so it was thought, of Joseph, the son of Heli,
42Lk 3:24 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
42Lk 3:25 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
42Lk 3:26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,
42Lk 3:27 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
42Lk 3:28 the son of Melki, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
42Lk 3:29 the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
42Lk 3:30 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
42Lk 3:31 the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
42Lk 3:32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
42Lk 3:33 the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
42Lk 3:34 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
42Lk 3:35 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
42Lk 3:36 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
42Lk 3:37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Kenan,
42Lk 3:38 the son of Enosh, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
42Lk 4:1 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert,
42Lk 4:2 where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.
42Lk 4:3 The devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread."
42Lk 4:4 Jesus answered, "It is written£º 'Man does not live on bread alone.'"
42Lk 4:5 The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.
42Lk 4:6 And he said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendor, for it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.
42Lk 4:7 So if you worship me, it will all be yours."
42Lk 4:8 Jesus answered, "It is written£º 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.'"
42Lk 4:9 The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down from here.
42Lk 4:10 For it is written£º "'He will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully;
42Lk 4:11 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
42Lk 4:12 Jesus answered, "It says£º 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"
42Lk 4:13 When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.
42Lk 4:14 Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about him spread through the whole countryside.
42Lk 4:15 He taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.
42Lk 4:16 He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. And he stood up to read.
42Lk 4:17 The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written£º
42Lk 4:18 "The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed,
42Lk 4:19 to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."
42Lk 4:20 Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him,
42Lk 4:21 and he began by saying to them, "Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."
42Lk 4:22 All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. "Isn't this Joseph's son?" they asked.
42Lk 4:23 Jesus said to them, "Surely you will quote this proverb to me£º 'Physician, heal yourself! Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.'"
42Lk 4:24 "I tell you the truth," he continued, "no prophet is accepted in his hometown.
42Lk 4:25 I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.
42Lk 4:26 Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.
42Lk 4:27 And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed--only Naaman the Syrian."
42Lk 4:28 All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this.
42Lk 4:29 They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him down the cliff.
42Lk 4:30 But he walked right through the crowd and went on his way.
42Lk 4:31 Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath began to teach the people.
42Lk 4:32 They were amazed at his teaching, because his message had authority.
42Lk 4:33 In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an evil spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice,
42Lk 4:34 "Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God!"
42Lk 4:35 "Be quiet!" Jesus said sternly. "Come out of him!" Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him.
42Lk 4:36 All the people were amazed and said to each other, "What is this teaching? With authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out!"
42Lk 4:37 And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area.
42Lk 4:38 Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon's mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her.
42Lk 4:39 So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them.
42Lk 4:40 When the sun was setting, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.
42Lk 4:41 Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Christ.
42Lk 4:42 At daybreak Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.
42Lk 4:43 But he said, "I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent."
42Lk 4:44 And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
42Lk 5:1 One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the people crowding around him and listening to the word of God,
42Lk 5:2 he saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.
42Lk 5:3 He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
42Lk 5:4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch."
42Lk 5:5 Simon answered, "Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets."
42Lk 5:6 When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.
42Lk 5:7 So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
42Lk 5:8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus' knees and said, "Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"
42Lk 5:9 For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken,
42Lk 5:10 and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men."
42Lk 5:11 So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.
42Lk 5:12 While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
42Lk 5:13 Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. "I am willing," he said. "Be clean!" And immediately the leprosy left him.
42Lk 5:14 Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them."
42Lk 5:15 Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses.
42Lk 5:16 But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed.
42Lk 5:17 One day as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law, who had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem, were sitting there. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal the sick.
42Lk 5:18 Some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus.
42Lk 5:19 When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.
42Lk 5:20 When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Friend, your sins are forgiven."
42Lk 5:21 The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, "Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
42Lk 5:22 Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, "Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
42Lk 5:23 Which is easier£º to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk'?
42Lk 5:24 But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. . . ." He said to the paralyzed man, "I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home."
42Lk 5:25 Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God.
42Lk 5:26 Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, "We have seen remarkable things today."
42Lk 5:27 After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. "Follow me," Jesus said to him,
42Lk 5:28 and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.
42Lk 5:29 Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.
42Lk 5:30 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and 'sinners'?"
42Lk 5:31 Jesus answered them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.
42Lk 5:32 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
42Lk 5:33 They said to him, "John's disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking."
42Lk 5:34 Jesus answered, "Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?
42Lk 5:35 But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast."
42Lk 5:36 He told them this parable£º "No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one. If he does, he will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.
42Lk 5:37 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.
42Lk 5:38 No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.
42Lk 5:39 And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, 'The old is better.'"
42Lk 6:1 One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels.
42Lk 6:2 Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?"
42Lk 6:3 Jesus answered them, "Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
42Lk 6:4 He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions."
42Lk 6:5 Then Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
42Lk 6:6 On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled.
42Lk 6:7 The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath.
42Lk 6:8 But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, "Get up and stand in front of everyone." So he got up and stood there.
42Lk 6:9 Then Jesus said to them, "I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath£º to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?"
42Lk 6:10 He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so, and his hand was completely restored.
42Lk 6:11 But they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.
42Lk 6:12 One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God.
42Lk 6:13 When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles£º
42Lk 6:14 Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
42Lk 6:15 Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon who was called the Zealot,
42Lk 6:16 Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
42Lk 6:17 He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coast of Tyre and Sidon,
42Lk 6:18 who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by evil spirits were cured,
42Lk 6:19 and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all.
42Lk 6:20 Looking at his disciples, he said£º "Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
42Lk 6:21 Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.
42Lk 6:22 Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.
42Lk 6:23 "Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets.
42Lk 6:24 "But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.
42Lk 6:25 Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will go hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.
42Lk 6:26 Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets.
42Lk 6:27 "But I tell you who hear me£º Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
42Lk 6:28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
42Lk 6:29 If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. If someone takes your cloak, do not stop him from taking your tunic.
42Lk 6:30 Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back.
42Lk 6:31 Do to others as you would have them do to you.
42Lk 6:32 "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' love those who love them.
42Lk 6:33 And if you do good to those who are good to you, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' do that.
42Lk 6:34 And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even 'sinners' lend to 'sinners,' expecting to be repaid in full.
42Lk 6:35 But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.
42Lk 6:36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
42Lk 6:37 "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
42Lk 6:38 Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."
42Lk 6:39 He also told them this parable£º "Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?
42Lk 6:40 A student is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.
42Lk 6:41 "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?
42Lk 6:42 How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
42Lk 6:43 "No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.
42Lk 6:44 Each tree is recognized by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.
42Lk 6:45 The good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks.
42Lk 6:46 "Why do you call me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do what I say?
42Lk 6:47 I will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice.
42Lk 6:48 He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.
42Lk 6:49 But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete."
42Lk 7:1 When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.
42Lk 7:2 There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.
42Lk 7:3 The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant.
42Lk 7:4 When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, "This man deserves to have you do this,
42Lk 7:5 because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue."
42Lk 7:6 So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him£º "Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.
42Lk 7:7 That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.
42Lk 7:8 For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."
42Lk 7:9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, "I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel."
42Lk 7:10 Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.
42Lk 7:11 Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.
42Lk 7:12 As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out--the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.
42Lk 7:13 When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, "Don't cry."
42Lk 7:14 Then he went up and touched the coffin, and those carrying it stood still. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!"
42Lk 7:15 The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
42Lk 7:16 They were all filled with awe and praised God. "A great prophet has appeared among us," they said. "God has come to help his people."
42Lk 7:17 This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country.
42Lk 7:18 John's disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them,
42Lk 7:19 he sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?"
42Lk 7:20 When the men came to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the one who was to come, or should we expect someone else?'"
42Lk 7:21 At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.
42Lk 7:22 So he replied to the messengers, "Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard£º The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.
42Lk 7:23 Blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me."
42Lk 7:24 After John's messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John£º "What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swayed by the wind?
42Lk 7:25 If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.
42Lk 7:26 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.
42Lk 7:27 This is the one about whom it is written£º "'I will send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
42Lk 7:28 I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
42Lk 7:29 (All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus' words, acknowledged that God's way was right, because they had been baptized by John.
42Lk 7:30 But the Pharisees and experts in the law rejected God's purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.)
42Lk 7:31 "To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?
42Lk 7:32 They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other£º "'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry.'
42Lk 7:33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'
42Lk 7:34 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and "sinners." '
42Lk 7:35 But wisdom is proved right by all her children."
42Lk 7:36 Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, so he went to the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
42Lk 7:37 When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume,
42Lk 7:38 and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them.
42Lk 7:39 When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is--that she is a sinner."
42Lk 7:40 Jesus answered him, "Simon, I have something to tell you." "Tell me, teacher," he said.
42Lk 7:41 "Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.
42Lk 7:42 Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?"
42Lk 7:43 Simon replied, "I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled." "You have judged correctly," Jesus said.
42Lk 7:44 Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
42Lk 7:45 You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.
42Lk 7:46 You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.
42Lk 7:47 Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven--for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little."
42Lk 7:48 Then Jesus said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
42Lk 7:49 The other guests began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"
42Lk 7:50 Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
42Lk 8:1 After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,
42Lk 8:2 and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases£º Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;
42Lk 8:3 Joanna the wife of Cuza, the manager of Herod's household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means.
42Lk 8:4 While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable£º
42Lk 8:5 "A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds of the air ate it up.
42Lk 8:6 Some fell on rock, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.
42Lk 8:7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.
42Lk 8:8 Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown." When he said this, he called out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
42Lk 8:9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
42Lk 8:10 He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, "'though seeing, they may not see; though hearing, they may not understand.'
42Lk 8:11 "This is the meaning of the parable£º The seed is the word of God.
42Lk 8:12 Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
42Lk 8:13 Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.
42Lk 8:14 The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.
42Lk 8:15 But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.
42Lk 8:16 "No one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.
42Lk 8:17 For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.
42Lk 8:18 Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him."
42Lk 8:19 Now Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd.
42Lk 8:20 Someone told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you."
42Lk 8:21 He replied, "My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice."
42Lk 8:22 One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's go over to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and set out.
42Lk 8:23 As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger.
42Lk 8:24 The disciples went and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.
42Lk 8:25 "Where is your faith?" he asked his disciples. In fear and amazement they asked one another, "Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him."
42Lk 8:26 They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.
42Lk 8:27 When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.
42Lk 8:28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don't torture me!"
42Lk 8:29 For Jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.
42Lk 8:30 Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, because many demons had gone into him.
42Lk 8:31 And they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss.
42Lk 8:32 A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into them, and he gave them permission.
42Lk 8:33 When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned.
42Lk 8:34 When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,
42Lk 8:35 and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
42Lk 8:36 Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured.
42Lk 8:37 Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left.
42Lk 8:38 The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
42Lk 8:39 "Return home and tell how much God has done for you." So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him.
42Lk 8:40 Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him.
42Lk 8:41 Then a man named Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come to his house
42Lk 8:42 because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him.
42Lk 8:43 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her.
42Lk 8:44 She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped.
42Lk 8:45 "Who touched me?" Jesus asked. When they all denied it, Peter said, "Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you."
42Lk 8:46 But Jesus said, "Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me."
42Lk 8:47 Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.
42Lk 8:48 Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."
42Lk 8:49 While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue ruler. "Your daughter is dead," he said. "Don't bother the teacher any more."
42Lk 8:50 Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed."
42Lk 8:51 When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child's father and mother.
42Lk 8:52 Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. "Stop wailing," Jesus said. "She is not dead but asleep."
42Lk 8:53 They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
42Lk 8:54 But he took her by the hand and said, "My child, get up!"
42Lk 8:55 Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat.
42Lk 8:56 Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened.
42Lk 9:1 When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases,
42Lk 9:2 and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
42Lk 9:3 He told them£º "Take nothing for the journey--no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra tunic.
42Lk 9:4 Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.
42Lk 9:5 If people do not welcome you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town, as a testimony against them."
42Lk 9:6 So they set out and went from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere.
42Lk 9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed, because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,
42Lk 9:8 others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life.
42Lk 9:9 But Herod said, "I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?" And he tried to see him.
42Lk 9:10 When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida,
42Lk 9:11 but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing.
42Lk 9:12 Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, "Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here."
42Lk 9:13 He replied, "You give them something to eat." They answered, "We have only five loaves of bread and two fish--unless we go and buy food for all this crowd."
42Lk 9:14 (About five thousand men were there.) But he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each."
42Lk 9:15 The disciples did so, and everybody sat down.
42Lk 9:16 Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people.
42Lk 9:17 They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.
42Lk 9:18 Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"
42Lk 9:19 They replied, "Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life."
42Lk 9:20 "But what about you?" he asked. "Who do you say I am?" Peter answered, "The Christ of God."
42Lk 9:21 Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone.
42Lk 9:22 And he said, "The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life."
42Lk 9:23 Then he said to them all£º "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.
42Lk 9:24 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it.
42Lk 9:25 What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self?
42Lk 9:26 If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.
42Lk 9:27 I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God."
42Lk 9:28 About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray.
42Lk 9:29 As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning.
42Lk 9:30 Two men, Moses and Elijah,
42Lk 9:31 appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:32 Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him.
42Lk 9:33 As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, "Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah." (He did not know what he was saying.)
42Lk 9:34 While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
42Lk 9:35 A voice came from the cloud, saying, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him."
42Lk 9:36 When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves, and told no one at that time what they had seen.
42Lk 9:37 The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.
42Lk 9:38 A man in the crowd called out, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child.
42Lk 9:39 A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him.
42Lk 9:40 I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not."
42Lk 9:41 "O unbelieving and perverse generation," Jesus replied, "how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here."
42Lk 9:42 Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.
42Lk 9:43 And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,
42Lk 9:44 "Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you£º The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men."
42Lk 9:45 But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.
42Lk 9:46 An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.
42Lk 9:47 Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.
42Lk 9:48 Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For he who is least among you all--he is the greatest."
42Lk 9:49 "Master," said John, "we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us."
42Lk 9:50 "Do not stop him," Jesus said, "for whoever is not against you is for you."
42Lk 9:51 As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:52 And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him;
42Lk 9:53 but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:54 When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?"
42Lk 9:55 But Jesus turned and rebuked them,
42Lk 9:56 and they went to another village.
42Lk 9:57 As they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go."
42Lk 9:58 Jesus replied, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
42Lk 9:59 He said to another man, "Follow me." But the man replied, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father."
42Lk 9:60 Jesus said to him, "Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
42Lk 9:61 Still another said, "I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family."
42Lk 9:62 Jesus replied, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God."
42Lk 10:1 After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go.
42Lk 10:2 He told them, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.
42Lk 10:3 Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
42Lk 10:4 Do not take a purse or bag or sandals; and do not greet anyone on the road.
42Lk 10:5 "When you enter a house, first say, 'Peace to this house.'
42Lk 10:6 If a man of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; if not, it will return to you.
42Lk 10:7 Stay in that house, eating and drinking whatever they give you, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move around from house to house.
42Lk 10:8 "When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you.
42Lk 10:9 Heal the sick who are there and tell them, 'The kingdom of God is near you.'
42Lk 10:10 But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,
42Lk 10:11 'Even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this£º The kingdom of God is near.'
42Lk 10:12 I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town.
42Lk 10:13 "Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
42Lk 10:14 But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
42Lk 10:15 And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths.
42Lk 10:16 "He who listens to you listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me."
42Lk 10:17 The seventy-two returned with joy and said, "Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name."
42Lk 10:18 He replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.
42Lk 10:19 I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.
42Lk 10:20 However, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven."
42Lk 10:21 At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.
42Lk 10:22 "All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
42Lk 10:23 Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.
42Lk 10:24 For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it."
42Lk 10:25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
42Lk 10:26 "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"
42Lk 10:27 He answered£º "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"
42Lk 10:28 "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."
42Lk 10:29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
42Lk 10:30 In reply Jesus said£º "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.
42Lk 10:31 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.
42Lk 10:32 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.
42Lk 10:33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.
42Lk 10:34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him.
42Lk 10:35 The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'
42Lk 10:36 "Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"
42Lk 10:37 The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him." Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."
42Lk 10:38 As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.
42Lk 10:39 She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said.
42Lk 10:40 But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!"
42Lk 10:41 "Martha, Martha," the Lord answered, "you are worried and upset about many things,
42Lk 10:42 but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."
42Lk 11:1 One day Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."
42Lk 11:2 He said to them, "When you pray, say£º "'Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come.
42Lk 11:3 Give us each day our daily bread.
42Lk 11:4 Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.'"
42Lk 11:5 Then he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and he goes to him at midnight and says, 'Friend, lend me three loaves of bread,
42Lk 11:6 because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have nothing to set before him.'
42Lk 11:7 "Then the one inside answers, 'Don't bother me. The door is already locked, and my children are with me in bed. I can't get up and give you anything.'
42Lk 11:8 I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend, yet because of the man's boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.
42Lk 11:9 "So I say to you£º Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.
42Lk 11:10 For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.
42Lk 11:11 "Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?
42Lk 11:12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?
42Lk 11:13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"
42Lk 11:14 Jesus was driving out a demon that was mute. When the demon left, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowd was amazed.
42Lk 11:15 But some of them said, "By Beelzebub, the prince of demons, he is driving out demons."
42Lk 11:16 Others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven.
42Lk 11:17 Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them£º "Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house divided against itself will fall.
42Lk 11:18 If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.
42Lk 11:19 Now if I drive out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your followers drive them out? So then, they will be your judges.
42Lk 11:20 But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
42Lk 11:21 "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are safe.
42Lk 11:22 But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils.
42Lk 11:23 "He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me, scatters.
42Lk 11:24 "When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.'
42Lk 11:25 When it arrives, it finds the house swept clean and put in order.
42Lk 11:26 Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first."
42Lk 11:27 As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, "Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you."
42Lk 11:28 He replied, "Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it."
42Lk 11:29 As the crowds increased, Jesus said, "This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.
42Lk 11:30 For as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.
42Lk 11:31 The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here.
42Lk 11:32 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.
42Lk 11:33 "No one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden, or under a bowl. Instead he puts it on its stand, so that those who come in may see the light.
42Lk 11:34 Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are good, your whole body also is full of light. But when they are bad, your body also is full of darkness.
42Lk 11:35 See to it, then, that the light within you is not darkness.
42Lk 11:36 Therefore, if your whole body is full of light, and no part of it dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the light of a lamp shines on you."
42Lk 11:37 When Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to eat with him; so he went in and reclined at the table.
42Lk 11:38 But the Pharisee, noticing that Jesus did not first wash before the meal, was surprised.
42Lk 11:39 Then the Lord said to him, "Now then, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.
42Lk 11:40 You foolish people! Did not the one who made the outside make the inside also?
42Lk 11:41 But give what is inside the dish to the poor, and everything will be clean for you.
42Lk 11:42 "Woe to you Pharisees, because you give God a tenth of your mint, rue and all other kinds of garden herbs, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone.
42Lk 11:43 "Woe to you Pharisees, because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.
42Lk 11:44 "Woe to you, because you are like unmarked graves, which men walk over without knowing it."
42Lk 11:45 One of the experts in the law answered him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us also."
42Lk 11:46 Jesus replied, "And you experts in the law, woe to you, because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry, and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them.
42Lk 11:47 "Woe to you, because you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your forefathers who killed them.
42Lk 11:48 So you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.
42Lk 11:49 Because of this, God in his wisdom said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute.'
42Lk 11:50 Therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world,
42Lk 11:51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, this generation will be held responsible for it all.
42Lk 11:52 "Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering."
42Lk 11:53 When Jesus left there, the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions,
42Lk 11:54 waiting to catch him in something he might say.
42Lk 12:1 Meanwhile, when a crowd of many thousands had gathered, so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, saying£º "Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
42Lk 12:2 There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.
42Lk 12:3 What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.
42Lk 12:4 "I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more.
42Lk 12:5 But I will show you whom you should fear£º Fear him who, after the killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him.
42Lk 12:6 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.
42Lk 12:7 Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
42Lk 12:8 "I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.
42Lk 12:9 But he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God.
42Lk 12:10 And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
42Lk 12:11 "When you are brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say,
42Lk 12:12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say."
42Lk 12:13 Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
42Lk 12:14 Jesus replied, "Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?"
42Lk 12:15 Then he said to them, "Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions."
42Lk 12:16 And he told them this parable£º "The ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop.
42Lk 12:17 He thought to himself, 'What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.'
42Lk 12:18 "Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
42Lk 12:19 And I'll say to myself, "You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry." '
42Lk 12:20 "But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?'
42Lk 12:21 "This is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward God."
42Lk 12:22 Then Jesus said to his disciples£º "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; or about your body, what you will wear.
42Lk 12:23 Life is more than food, and the body more than clothes.
42Lk 12:24 Consider the ravens£º They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn; yet God feeds them. And how much more valuable you are than birds!
42Lk 12:25 Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?
42Lk 12:26 Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?
42Lk 12:27 "Consider how the lilies grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these.
42Lk 12:28 If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today, and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!
42Lk 12:29 And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not worry about it.
42Lk 12:30 For the pagan world runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them.
42Lk 12:31 But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.
42Lk 12:32 "Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.
42Lk 12:33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.
42Lk 12:34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
42Lk 12:35 "Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning,
42Lk 12:36 like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.
42Lk 12:37 It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them.
42Lk 12:38 It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night.
42Lk 12:39 But understand this£º If the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into.
42Lk 12:40 You also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him."
42Lk 12:41 Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to everyone?"
42Lk 12:42 The Lord answered, "Who then is the faithful and wise manager, whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time?
42Lk 12:43 It will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns.
42Lk 12:44 I tell you the truth, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.
42Lk 12:45 But suppose the servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time in coming,' and he then begins to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk.
42Lk 12:46 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
42Lk 12:47 "That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows.
42Lk 12:48 But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.
42Lk 12:49 "I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!
42Lk 12:50 But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed!
42Lk 12:51 Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division.
42Lk 12:52 From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three.
42Lk 12:53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."
42Lk 12:54 He said to the crowd£º "When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, 'It's going to rain,' and it does.
42Lk 12:55 And when the south wind blows, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and it is.
42Lk 12:56 Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky. How is it that you don't know how to interpret this present time?
42Lk 12:57 "Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?
42Lk 12:58 As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, try hard to be reconciled to him on the way, or he may drag you off to the judge, and the judge turn you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.
42Lk 12:59 I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny."
42Lk 13:1 Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
42Lk 13:2 Jesus answered, "Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?
42Lk 13:3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.
42Lk 13:4 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them--do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?
42Lk 13:5 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish."
42Lk 13:6 Then he told this parable£º "A man had a fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any.
42Lk 13:7 So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?'
42Lk 13:8 "'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it.
42Lk 13:9 If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down.'"
42Lk 13:10 On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues,
42Lk 13:11 and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.
42Lk 13:12 When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, "Woman, you are set free from your infirmity."
42Lk 13:13 Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God.
42Lk 13:14 Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue ruler said to the people, "There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath."
42Lk 13:15 The Lord answered him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?
42Lk 13:16 Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?"
42Lk 13:17 When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing.
42Lk 13:18 Then Jesus asked, "What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?
42Lk 13:19 It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air perched in its branches."
42Lk 13:20 Again he asked, "What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?
42Lk 13:21 It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough."
42Lk 13:22 Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem.
42Lk 13:23 Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them,
42Lk 13:24 "Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to.
42Lk 13:25 Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, 'Sir, open the door for us.' "But he will answer, 'I don't know you or where you come from.'
42Lk 13:26 "Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'
42Lk 13:27 "But he will reply, 'I don't know you or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!'
42Lk 13:28 "There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.
42Lk 13:29 People will come from east and west and north and south, and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of God.
42Lk 13:30 Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last."
42Lk 13:31 At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, "Leave this place and go somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you."
42Lk 13:32 He replied, "Go tell that fox, 'I will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'
42Lk 13:33 In any case, I must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day--for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!
42Lk 13:34 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!
42Lk 13:35 Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"
42Lk 14:1 One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched.
42Lk 14:2 There in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy.
42Lk 14:3 Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"
42Lk 14:4 But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him away.
42Lk 14:5 Then he asked them, "If one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?"
42Lk 14:6 And they had nothing to say.
42Lk 14:7 When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable£º
42Lk 14:8 "When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.
42Lk 14:9 If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, 'Give this man your seat.' Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.
42Lk 14:10 But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, 'Friend, move up to a better place.' Then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests.
42Lk 14:11 For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."
42Lk 14:12 Then Jesus said to his host, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.
42Lk 14:13 But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,
42Lk 14:14 and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."
42Lk 14:15 When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, "Blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God."
42Lk 14:16 Jesus replied£º "A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.
42Lk 14:17 At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, 'Come, for everything is now ready.'
42Lk 14:18 "But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, 'I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.'
42Lk 14:19 "Another said, 'I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.'
42Lk 14:20 "Still another said, 'I just got married, so I can't come.'
42Lk 14:21 "The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.'
42Lk 14:22 "'Sir,' the servant said, 'what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.'
42Lk 14:23 "Then the master told his servant, 'Go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in, so that my house will be full.
42Lk 14:24 I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.'"
42Lk 14:25 Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said£º
42Lk 14:26 "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters--yes, even his own life--he cannot be my disciple.
42Lk 14:27 And anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.
42Lk 14:28 "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it?
42Lk 14:29 For if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule him,
42Lk 14:30 saying, 'This fellow began to build and was not able to finish.'
42Lk 14:31 "Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?
42Lk 14:32 If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.
42Lk 14:33 In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple.
42Lk 14:34 "Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?
42Lk 14:35 It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile; it is thrown out. "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."
42Lk 15:1 Now the tax collectors and "sinners" were all gathering around to hear him.
42Lk 15:2 But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."
42Lk 15:3 Then Jesus told them this parable£º
42Lk 15:4 "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?
42Lk 15:5 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders
42Lk 15:6 and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.'
42Lk 15:7 I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.
42Lk 15:8 "Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Does she not light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?
42Lk 15:9 And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.'
42Lk 15:10 In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."
42Lk 15:11 Jesus continued£º "There was a man who had two sons.
42Lk 15:12 The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.
42Lk 15:13 "Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.
42Lk 15:14 After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.
42Lk 15:15 So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.
42Lk 15:16 He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.
42Lk 15:17 "When he came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!
42Lk 15:18 I will set out and go back to my father and say to him£º Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.
42Lk 15:19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.'
42Lk 15:20 So he got up and went to his father. "But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.
42Lk 15:21 "The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.'
42Lk 15:22 "But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
42Lk 15:23 Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate.
42Lk 15:24 For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.' So they began to celebrate.
42Lk 15:25 "Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.
42Lk 15:26 So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.
42Lk 15:27 'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'
42Lk 15:28 "The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.
42Lk 15:29 But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.
42Lk 15:30 But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!'
42Lk 15:31 "'My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.
42Lk 15:32 But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'"
42Lk 16:1 Jesus told his disciples£º "There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.
42Lk 16:2 So he called him in and asked him, 'What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.'
42Lk 16:3 "The manager said to himself, 'What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg--
42Lk 16:4 I know what I'll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.'
42Lk 16:5 "So he called in each one of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'
42Lk 16:6 "'Eight hundred gallons of olive oil,' he replied. "The manager told him, 'Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred.'
42Lk 16:7 "Then he asked the second, 'And how much do you owe?' "'A thousand bushels of wheat,' he replied. "He told him, 'Take your bill and make it eight hundred.'
42Lk 16:8 "The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light.
42Lk 16:9 I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
42Lk 16:10 "Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.
42Lk 16:11 So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?
42Lk 16:12 And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?
42Lk 16:13 "No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money."
42Lk 16:14 The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus.
42Lk 16:15 He said to them, "You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men, but God knows your hearts. What is highly valued among men is detestable in God's sight.
42Lk 16:16 "The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.
42Lk 16:17 It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.
42Lk 16:18 "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.
42Lk 16:19 "There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
42Lk 16:20 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores
42Lk 16:21 and longing to eat what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
42Lk 16:22 "The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.
42Lk 16:23 In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.
42Lk 16:24 So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.'
42Lk 16:25 "But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.
42Lk 16:26 And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'
42Lk 16:27 "He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house,
42Lk 16:28 for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'
42Lk 16:29 "Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.'
42Lk 16:30 "'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'
42Lk 16:31 "He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'"
42Lk 17:1 Jesus said to his disciples£º "Things that cause people to sin are bound to come, but woe to that person through whom they come.
42Lk 17:2 It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.
42Lk 17:3 So watch yourselves. "If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.
42Lk 17:4 If he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times comes back to you and says, 'I repent,' forgive him."
42Lk 17:5 The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"
42Lk 17:6 He replied, "If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.
42Lk 17:7 "Suppose one of you had a servant plowing or looking after the sheep. Would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field, 'Come along now and sit down to eat'?
42Lk 17:8 Would he not rather say, 'Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and wait on me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink'?
42Lk 17:9 Would he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do?
42Lk 17:10 So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, 'We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.'"
42Lk 17:11 Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.
42Lk 17:12 As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. They stood at a distance
42Lk 17:13 and called out in a loud voice, "Jesus, Master, have pity on us!"
42Lk 17:14 When he saw them, he said, "Go, show yourselves to the priests." And as they went, they were cleansed.
42Lk 17:15 One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.
42Lk 17:16 He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him--and he was a Samaritan.
42Lk 17:17 Jesus asked, "Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?
42Lk 17:18 Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?"
42Lk 17:19 Then he said to him, "Rise and go; your faith has made you well."
42Lk 17:20 Once, having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, "The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation,
42Lk 17:21 nor will people say, 'Here it is,' or 'There it is,' because the kingdom of God is within you."
42Lk 17:22 Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.
42Lk 17:23 Men will tell you, 'There he is!' or 'Here he is!' Do not go running off after them.
42Lk 17:24 For the Son of Man in his day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.
42Lk 17:25 But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.
42Lk 17:26 "Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
42Lk 17:27 People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.
42Lk 17:28 "It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.
42Lk 17:29 But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
42Lk 17:30 "It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
42Lk 17:31 On that day no one who is on the roof of his house, with his goods inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.
42Lk 17:32 Remember Lot's wife!
42Lk 17:33 Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life will preserve it.
42Lk 17:34 I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.
42Lk 17:35 Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left."
42Lk 17:36 Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.
42Lk 17:37 "Where, Lord?" they asked. He replied, "Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather."
42Lk 18:1 Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up.
42Lk 18:2 He said£º "In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared about men.
42Lk 18:3 And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'
42Lk 18:4 "For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, 'Even though I don't fear God or care about men,
42Lk 18:5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won't eventually wear me out with her coming!'"
42Lk 18:6 And the Lord said, "Listen to what the unjust judge says.
42Lk 18:7 And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?
42Lk 18:8 I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?"
42Lk 18:9 To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable£º
42Lk 18:10 "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
42Lk 18:11 The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself£º 'God, I thank you that I am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector.
42Lk 18:12 I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'
42Lk 18:13 "But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'
42Lk 18:14 "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."
42Lk 18:15 People were also bringing babies to Jesus to have him touch them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.
42Lk 18:16 But Jesus called the children to him and said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.
42Lk 18:17 I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it."
42Lk 18:18 A certain ruler asked him, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
42Lk 18:19 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus answered. "No one is good--except God alone.
42Lk 18:20 You know the commandments£º 'Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.'"
42Lk 18:21 "All these I have kept since I was a boy," he said.
42Lk 18:22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
42Lk 18:23 When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.
42Lk 18:24 Jesus looked at him and said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!
42Lk 18:25 Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."
42Lk 18:26 Those who heard this asked, "Who then can be saved?"
42Lk 18:27 Jesus replied, "What is impossible with men is possible with God."
42Lk 18:28 Peter said to him, "We have left all we had to follow you!"
42Lk 18:29 "I tell you the truth," Jesus said to them, "no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God
42Lk 18:30 will fail to receive many times as much in this age and, in the age to come, eternal life."
42Lk 18:31 Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, "We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
42Lk 18:32 He will be handed over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him, spit on him, flog him and kill him.
42Lk 18:33 On the third day he will rise again."
42Lk 18:34 The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.
42Lk 18:35 As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
42Lk 18:36 When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
42Lk 18:37 They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."
42Lk 18:38 He called out, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42Lk 18:39 Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42Lk 18:40 Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,
42Lk 18:41 "What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord, I want to see," he replied.
42Lk 18:42 Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight; your faith has healed you."
42Lk 18:43 Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God.
42Lk 19:1 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
42Lk 19:2 A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
42Lk 19:3 He wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of the crowd.
42Lk 19:4 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.
42Lk 19:5 When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today."
42Lk 19:6 So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
42Lk 19:7 All the people saw this and began to mutter, "He has gone to be the guest of a 'sinner.'"
42Lk 19:8 But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount."
42Lk 19:9 Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.
42Lk 19:10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost."
42Lk 19:11 While they were listening to this, he went on to tell them a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear at once.
42Lk 19:12 He said£º "A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return.
42Lk 19:13 So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas. 'Put this money to work,' he said, 'until I come back.'
42Lk 19:14 "But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this man to be our king.'
42Lk 19:15 "He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.
42Lk 19:16 "The first one came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned ten more.'
42Lk 19:17 "'Well done, my good servant!' his master replied. 'Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.'
42Lk 19:18 "The second came and said, 'Sir, your mina has earned five more.'
42Lk 19:19 "His master answered, 'You take charge of five cities.'
42Lk 19:20 "Then another servant came and said, 'Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth.
42Lk 19:21 I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow.'
42Lk 19:22 "His master replied, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew, did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did not sow?
42Lk 19:23 Why then didn't you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I could have collected it with interest?'
42Lk 19:24 "Then he said to those standing by, 'Take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas.'
42Lk 19:25 "'Sir,' they said, 'he already has ten!'
42Lk 19:26 "He replied, 'I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.
42Lk 19:27 But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them--bring them here and kill them in front of me.'"
42Lk 19:28 After Jesus had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.
42Lk 19:29 As he approached Bethphage and Bethany at the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, saying to them,
42Lk 19:30 "Go to the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
42Lk 19:31 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' tell him, 'The Lord needs it.'"
42Lk 19:32 Those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them.
42Lk 19:33 As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
42Lk 19:34 They replied, "The Lord needs it."
42Lk 19:35 They brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt and put Jesus on it.
42Lk 19:36 As he went along, people spread their cloaks on the road.
42Lk 19:37 When he came near the place where the road goes down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise God in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen£º
42Lk 19:38 "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!"
42Lk 19:39 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples!"
42Lk 19:40 "I tell you," he replied, "if they keep quiet, the stones will cry out."
42Lk 19:41 As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it
42Lk 19:42 and said, "If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace--but now it is hidden from your eyes.
42Lk 19:43 The days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side.
42Lk 19:44 They will dash you to the ground, you and the children within your walls. They will not leave one stone on another, because you did not recognize the time of God's coming to you."
42Lk 19:45 Then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling.
42Lk 19:46 "It is written," he said to them, "'My house will be a house of prayer'; but you have made it 'a den of robbers.'"
42Lk 19:47 Every day he was teaching at the temple. But the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him.
42Lk 19:48 Yet they could not find any way to do it, because all the people hung on his words.
42Lk 20:1 One day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him.
42Lk 20:2 "Tell us by what authority you are doing these things," they said. "Who gave you this authority?"
42Lk 20:3 He replied, "I will also ask you a question. Tell me,
42Lk 20:4 John's baptism--was it from heaven, or from men?"
42Lk 20:5 They discussed it among themselves and said, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Why didn't you believe him?'
42Lk 20:6 But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet."
42Lk 20:7 So they answered, "We don't know where it was from."
42Lk 20:8 Jesus said, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
42Lk 20:9 He went on to tell the people this parable£º "A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.
42Lk 20:10 At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.
42Lk 20:11 He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.
42Lk 20:12 He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.
42Lk 20:13 "Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.'
42Lk 20:14 "But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. 'This is the heir,' they said. 'Let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'
42Lk 20:15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. "What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?
42Lk 20:16 He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others." When the people heard this, they said, "May this never be!"
42Lk 20:17 Jesus looked directly at them and asked, "Then what is the meaning of that which is written£º "'The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone'?
42Lk 20:18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed."
42Lk 20:19 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.
42Lk 20:20 Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be honest. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.
42Lk 20:21 So the spies questioned him£º "Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.
42Lk 20:22 Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
42Lk 20:23 He saw through their duplicity and said to them,
42Lk 20:24 "Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and inscription are on it?"
42Lk 20:25 "Caesar's," they replied. He said to them, "Then give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's."
42Lk 20:26 They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent.
42Lk 20:27 Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question.
42Lk 20:28 "Teacher," they said, "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother.
42Lk 20:29 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless.
42Lk 20:30 The second
42Lk 20:31 and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children.
42Lk 20:32 Finally, the woman died too.
42Lk 20:33 Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?"
42Lk 20:34 Jesus replied, "The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.
42Lk 20:35 But those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage,
42Lk 20:36 and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God's children, since they are children of the resurrection.
42Lk 20:37 But in the account of the bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'
42Lk 20:38 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive."
42Lk 20:39 Some of the teachers of the law responded, "Well said, teacher!"
42Lk 20:40 And no one dared to ask him any more questions.
42Lk 20:41 Then Jesus said to them, "How is it that they say the Christ is the Son of David?
42Lk 20:42 David himself declares in the Book of Psalms£º "'The Lord said to my Lord£º "Sit at my right hand
42Lk 20:43 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." '
42Lk 20:44 David calls him 'Lord.' How then can he be his son?"
42Lk 20:45 While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his disciples,
42Lk 20:46 "Beware of the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
42Lk 20:47 They devour widows' houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. Such men will be punished most severely."
42Lk 21:1 As he looked up, Jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury.
42Lk 21:2 He also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins.
42Lk 21:3 "I tell you the truth," he said, "this poor widow has put in more than all the others.
42Lk 21:4 All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on."
42Lk 21:5 Some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to God. But Jesus said,
42Lk 21:6 "As for what you see here, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another; every one of them will be thrown down."
42Lk 21:7 "Teacher," they asked, "when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are about to take place?"
42Lk 21:8 He replied£º "Watch out that you are not deceived. For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am he,' and, 'The time is near.' Do not follow them.
42Lk 21:9 When you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away."
42Lk 21:10 Then he said to them£º "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
42Lk 21:11 There will be great earthquakes, famines and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from heaven.
42Lk 21:12 "But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name.
42Lk 21:13 This will result in your being witnesses to them.
42Lk 21:14 But make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves.
42Lk 21:15 For I will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.
42Lk 21:16 You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives and friends, and they will put some of you to death.
42Lk 21:17 All men will hate you because of me.
42Lk 21:18 But not a hair of your head will perish.
42Lk 21:19 By standing firm you will gain life.
42Lk 21:20 "When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near.
42Lk 21:21 Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those in the city get out, and let those in the country not enter the city.
42Lk 21:22 For this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written.
42Lk 21:23 How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.
42Lk 21:24 They will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
42Lk 21:25 "There will be signs in the sun, moon and stars. On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.
42Lk 21:26 Men will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
42Lk 21:27 At that time they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
42Lk 21:28 When these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near."
42Lk 21:29 He told them this parable£º "Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
42Lk 21:30 When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.
42Lk 21:31 Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that the kingdom of God is near.
42Lk 21:32 "I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened.
42Lk 21:33 Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.
42Lk 21:34 "Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap.
42Lk 21:35 For it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth.
42Lk 21:36 Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man."
42Lk 21:37 Each day Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the Mount of Olives,
42Lk 21:38 and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
42Lk 22:1 Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching,
42Lk 22:2 and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.
42Lk 22:3 Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve.
42Lk 22:4 And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus.
42Lk 22:5 They were delighted and agreed to give him money.
42Lk 22:6 He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present.
42Lk 22:7 Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.
42Lk 22:8 Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover."
42Lk 22:9 "Where do you want us to prepare for it?" they asked.
42Lk 22:10 He replied, "As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,
42Lk 22:11 and say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks£º Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?'
42Lk 22:12 He will show you a large upper room, all furnished. Make preparations there."
42Lk 22:13 They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover.
42Lk 22:14 When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.
42Lk 22:15 And he said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
42Lk 22:16 For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God."
42Lk 22:17 After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, "Take this and divide it among you.
42Lk 22:18 For I tell you I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."
42Lk 22:19 And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me."
42Lk 22:20 In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.
42Lk 22:21 But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.
42Lk 22:22 The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays him."
42Lk 22:23 They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this.
42Lk 22:24 Also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest.
42Lk 22:25 Jesus said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.
42Lk 22:26 But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.
42Lk 22:27 For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.
42Lk 22:28 You are those who have stood by me in my trials.
42Lk 22:29 And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,
42Lk 22:30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
42Lk 22:31 "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.
42Lk 22:32 But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."
42Lk 22:33 But he replied, "Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death."
42Lk 22:34 Jesus answered, "I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me."
42Lk 22:35 Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" "Nothing," they answered.
42Lk 22:36 He said to them, "But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.
42Lk 22:37 It is written£º 'And he was numbered with the transgressors'; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment."
42Lk 22:38 The disciples said, "See, Lord, here are two swords." "That is enough," he replied.
42Lk 22:39 Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.
42Lk 22:40 On reaching the place, he said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."
42Lk 22:41 He withdrew about a stone's throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed,
42Lk 22:42 "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."
42Lk 22:43 An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.
42Lk 22:44 And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.
42Lk 22:45 When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.
42Lk 22:46 "Why are you sleeping?" he asked them. "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."
42Lk 22:47 While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him,
42Lk 22:48 but Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
42Lk 22:49 When Jesus' followers saw what was going to happen, they said, "Lord, should we strike with our swords?"
42Lk 22:50 And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.
42Lk 22:51 But Jesus answered, "No more of this!" And he touched the man's ear and healed him.
42Lk 22:52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, "Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?
42Lk 22:53 Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour--when darkness reigns."
42Lk 22:54 Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.
42Lk 22:55 But when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them.
42Lk 22:56 A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, "This man was with him."
42Lk 22:57 But he denied it. "Woman, I don't know him," he said.
42Lk 22:58 A little later someone else saw him and said, "You also are one of them." "Man, I am not!" Peter replied.
42Lk 22:59 About an hour later another asserted, "Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean."
42Lk 22:60 Peter replied, "Man, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.
42Lk 22:61 The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him£º "Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times."
42Lk 22:62 And he went outside and wept bitterly.
42Lk 22:63 The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him.
42Lk 22:64 They blindfolded him and demanded, "Prophesy! Who hit you?"
42Lk 22:65 And they said many other insulting things to him.
42Lk 22:66 At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them.
42Lk 22:67 "If you are the Christ," they said, "tell us." Jesus answered, "If I tell you, you will not believe me,
42Lk 22:68 and if I asked you, you would not answer.
42Lk 22:69 But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."
42Lk 22:70 They all asked, "Are you then the Son of God?" He replied, "You are right in saying I am."
42Lk 22:71 Then they said, "Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from his own lips."
42Lk 23:1 Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate.
42Lk 23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, "We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Christ, a king."
42Lk 23:3 So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
42Lk 23:4 Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, "I find no basis for a charge against this man."
42Lk 23:5 But they insisted, "He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here."
42Lk 23:6 On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean.
42Lk 23:7 When he learned that Jesus was under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
42Lk 23:8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform some miracle.
42Lk 23:9 He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer.
42Lk 23:10 The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him.
42Lk 23:11 Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.
42Lk 23:12 That day Herod and Pilate became friends--before this they had been enemies.
42Lk 23:13 Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people,
42Lk 23:14 and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him.
42Lk 23:15 Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death.
42Lk 23:16 Therefore, I will punish him and then release him."
42Lk 23:17 Now he was obliged to release one man to them at the Feast.
42Lk 23:18 With one voice they cried out, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!"
42Lk 23:19 (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)
42Lk 23:20 Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again.
42Lk 23:21 But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"
42Lk 23:22 For the third time he spoke to them£º "Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him."
42Lk 23:23 But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed.
42Lk 23:24 So Pilate decided to grant their demand.
42Lk 23:25 He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will.
42Lk 23:26 As they led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.
42Lk 23:27 A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him.
42Lk 23:28 Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.
42Lk 23:29 For the time will come when you will say, 'Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'
42Lk 23:30 Then "'they will say to the mountains, "Fall on us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!" '
42Lk 23:31 For if men do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?"
42Lk 23:32 Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed.
42Lk 23:33 When they came to the place called the Skull, there they crucified him, along with the criminals--one on his right, the other on his left.
42Lk 23:34 Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
42Lk 23:35 The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One."
42Lk 23:36 The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar
42Lk 23:37 and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."
42Lk 23:38 There was a written notice above him, which read£º THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
42Lk 23:39 One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him£º "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!"
42Lk 23:40 But the other criminal rebuked him. "Don't you fear God," he said, "since you are under the same sentence?
42Lk 23:41 We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong."
42Lk 23:42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."
42Lk 23:43 Jesus answered him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise."
42Lk 23:44 It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,
42Lk 23:45 for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
42Lk 23:46 Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit." When he had said this, he breathed his last.
42Lk 23:47 The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, "Surely this was a righteous man."
42Lk 23:48 When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.
42Lk 23:49 But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
42Lk 23:50 Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man,
42Lk 23:51 who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.
42Lk 23:52 Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body.
42Lk 23:53 Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid.
42Lk 23:54 It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
42Lk 23:55 The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.
42Lk 23:56 Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.
42Lk 24:1 On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb.
42Lk 24:2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
42Lk 24:3 but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
42Lk 24:4 While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them.
42Lk 24:5 In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead?
42Lk 24:6 He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee£º
42Lk 24:7 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.'"
42Lk 24:8 Then they remembered his words.
42Lk 24:9 When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.
42Lk 24:10 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles.
42Lk 24:11 But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense.
42Lk 24:12 Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.
42Lk 24:13 Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
42Lk 24:14 They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.
42Lk 24:15 As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them;
42Lk 24:16 but they were kept from recognizing him.
42Lk 24:17 He asked them, "What are you discussing together as you walk along?" They stood still, their faces downcast.
42Lk 24:18 One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, "Are you only a visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?"
42Lk 24:19 "What things?" he asked. "About Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people.
42Lk 24:20 The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him;
42Lk 24:21 but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place.
42Lk 24:22 In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning
42Lk 24:23 but didn't find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive.
42Lk 24:24 Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see."
42Lk 24:25 He said to them, "How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!
42Lk 24:26 Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?"
42Lk 24:27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself.
42Lk 24:28 As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther.
42Lk 24:29 But they urged him strongly, "Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over." So he went in to stay with them.
42Lk 24:30 When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them.
42Lk 24:31 Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight.
42Lk 24:32 They asked each other, "Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?"
42Lk 24:33 They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together
42Lk 24:34 and saying, "It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon."
42Lk 24:35 Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread.
42Lk 24:36 While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."
42Lk 24:37 They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost.
42Lk 24:38 He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?
42Lk 24:39 Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have."
42Lk 24:40 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet.
42Lk 24:41 And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
42Lk 24:42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
42Lk 24:43 and he took it and ate it in their presence.
42Lk 24:44 He said to them, "This is what I told you while I was still with you£º Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."
42Lk 24:45 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.
42Lk 24:46 He told them, "This is what is written£º The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,
42Lk 24:47 and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
42Lk 24:48 You are witnesses of these things.
42Lk 24:49 I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."
42Lk 24:50 When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
42Lk 24:51 While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven.
42Lk 24:52 Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
42Lk 24:53 And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God.
43
43Jn 1:1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
43Jn 1:2 He was with God in the beginning.
43Jn 1:3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.
43Jn 1:4 In him was life, and that life was the light of men.
43Jn 1:5 The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.
43Jn 1:6 There came a man who was sent from God; his name was John.
43Jn 1:7 He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all men might believe.
43Jn 1:8 He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.
43Jn 1:9 The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.
43Jn 1:10 He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.
43Jn 1:11 He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.
43Jn 1:12 Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--
43Jn 1:13 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God.
43Jn 1:14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
43Jn 1:15 John testifies concerning him. He cries out, saying, "This was he of whom I said, 'He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'"
43Jn 1:16 From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another.
43Jn 1:17 For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
43Jn 1:18 No one has ever seen God, but God the One and Only, who is at the Father's side, has made him known.
43Jn 1:19 Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was.
43Jn 1:20 He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, "I am not the Christ."
43Jn 1:21 They asked him, "Then who are you? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."
43Jn 1:22 Finally they said, "Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
43Jn 1:23 John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, "I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.'"
43Jn 1:24 Now some Pharisees who had been sent
43Jn 1:25 questioned him, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"
43Jn 1:26 "I baptize with water," John replied, "but among you stands one you do not know.
43Jn 1:27 He is the one who comes after me, the thongs of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie."
43Jn 1:28 This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
43Jn 1:29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
43Jn 1:30 This is the one I meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'
43Jn 1:31 I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel."
43Jn 1:32 Then John gave this testimony£º "I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him.
43Jn 1:33 I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'
43Jn 1:34 I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God."
43Jn 1:35 The next day John was there again with two of his disciples.
43Jn 1:36 When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"
43Jn 1:37 When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
43Jn 1:38 Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, "What do you want?" They said, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"
43Jn 1:39 "Come," he replied, "and you will see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was about the tenth hour.
43Jn 1:40 Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus.
43Jn 1:41 The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, "We have found the Messiah" (that is, the Christ).
43Jn 1:42 And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas" (which, when translated, is Peter).
43Jn 1:43 The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, "Follow me."
43Jn 1:44 Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida.
43Jn 1:45 Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote--Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
43Jn 1:46 "Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?" Nathanael asked. "Come and see," said Philip.
43Jn 1:47 When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, "Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is nothing false."
43Jn 1:48 "How do you know me?" Nathanael asked. Jesus answered, "I saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you."
43Jn 1:49 Then Nathanael declared, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel."
43Jn 1:50 Jesus said, "You believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You shall see greater things than that."
43Jn 1:51 He then added, "I tell you the truth, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
43Jn 2:1 On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,
43Jn 2:2 and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
43Jn 2:3 When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no more wine."
43Jn 2:4 "Dear woman, why do you involve me?" Jesus replied. "My time has not yet come."
43Jn 2:5 His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."
43Jn 2:6 Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.
43Jn 2:7 Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water"; so they filled them to the brim.
43Jn 2:8 Then he told them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." They did so,
43Jn 2:9 and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside
43Jn 2:10 and said, "Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."
43Jn 2:11 This, the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him.
43Jn 2:12 After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days.
43Jn 2:13 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43Jn 2:14 In the temple courts he found men selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.
43Jn 2:15 So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.
43Jn 2:16 To those who sold doves he said, "Get these out of here! How dare you turn my Father's house into a market!"
43Jn 2:17 His disciples remembered that it is written£º "Zeal for your house will consume me."
43Jn 2:18 Then the Jews demanded of him, "What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?"
43Jn 2:19 Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days."
43Jn 2:20 The Jews replied, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?"
43Jn 2:21 But the temple he had spoken of was his body.
43Jn 2:22 After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the Scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken.
43Jn 2:23 Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his name.
43Jn 2:24 But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all men.
43Jn 2:25 He did not need man's testimony about man, for he knew what was in a man.
43Jn 3:1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.
43Jn 3:2 He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him."
43Jn 3:3 In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again."
43Jn 3:4 "How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"
43Jn 3:5 Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.
43Jn 3:6 Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.
43Jn 3:7 You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.'
43Jn 3:8 The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit."
43Jn 3:9 "How can this be?" Nicodemus asked.
43Jn 3:10 "You are Israel's teacher," said Jesus, "and do you not understand these things?
43Jn 3:11 I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.
43Jn 3:12 I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?
43Jn 3:13 No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven--the Son of Man.
43Jn 3:14 Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
43Jn 3:15 that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.
43Jn 3:16 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
43Jn 3:17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
43Jn 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.
43Jn 3:19 This is the verdict£º Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil.
43Jn 3:20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed.
43Jn 3:21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God."
43Jn 3:22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized.
43Jn 3:23 Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were constantly coming to be baptized.
43Jn 3:24 (This was before John was put in prison.)
43Jn 3:25 An argument developed between some of John's disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing.
43Jn 3:26 They came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan--the one you testified about--well, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him."
43Jn 3:27 To this John replied, "A man can receive only what is given him from heaven.
43Jn 3:28 You yourselves can testify that I said, 'I am not the Christ but am sent ahead of him.'
43Jn 3:29 The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him, and is full of joy when he hears the bridegroom's voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.
43Jn 3:30 He must become greater; I must become less.
43Jn 3:31 "The one who comes from above is above all; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks as one from the earth. The one who comes from heaven is above all.
43Jn 3:32 He testifies to what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony.
43Jn 3:33 The man who has accepted it has certified that God is truthful.
43Jn 3:34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without limit.
43Jn 3:35 The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.
43Jn 3:36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him."
43Jn 4:1 The Pharisees heard that Jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,
43Jn 4:2 although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples.
43Jn 4:3 When the Lord learned of this, he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee.
43Jn 4:4 Now he had to go through Samaria.
43Jn 4:5 So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
43Jn 4:6 Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.
43Jn 4:7 When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?"
43Jn 4:8 (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)
43Jn 4:9 The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?" (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)
43Jn 4:10 Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."
43Jn 4:11 "Sir," the woman said, "you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?
43Jn 4:12 Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his flocks and herds?"
43Jn 4:13 Jesus answered, "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again,
43Jn 4:14 but whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."
43Jn 4:15 The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water so that I won't get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water."
43Jn 4:16 He told her, "Go, call your husband and come back."
43Jn 4:17 "I have no husband," she replied. Jesus said to her, "You are right when you say you have no husband.
43Jn 4:18 The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."
43Jn 4:19 "Sir," the woman said, "I can see that you are a prophet.
43Jn 4:20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem."
43Jn 4:21 Jesus declared, "Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
43Jn 4:22 You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.
43Jn 4:23 Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
43Jn 4:24 God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth."
43Jn 4:25 The woman said, "I know that Messiah" (called Christ) "is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."
43Jn 4:26 Then Jesus declared, "I who speak to you am he."
43Jn 4:27 Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, "What do you want?" or "Why are you talking with her?"
43Jn 4:28 Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people,
43Jn 4:29 "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?"
43Jn 4:30 They came out of the town and made their way toward him.
43Jn 4:31 Meanwhile his disciples urged him, "Rabbi, eat something."
43Jn 4:32 But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."
43Jn 4:33 Then his disciples said to each other, "Could someone have brought him food?"
43Jn 4:34 "My food," said Jesus, "is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.
43Jn 4:35 Do you not say, 'Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.
43Jn 4:36 Even now the reaper draws his wages, even now he harvests the crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.
43Jn 4:37 Thus the saying 'One sows and another reaps' is true.
43Jn 4:38 I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor."
43Jn 4:39 Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me everything I ever did."
43Jn 4:40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days.
43Jn 4:41 And because of his words many more became believers.
43Jn 4:42 They said to the woman, "We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world."
43Jn 4:43 After the two days he left for Galilee.
43Jn 4:44 (Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.)
43Jn 4:45 When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, for they also had been there.
43Jn 4:46 Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.
43Jn 4:47 When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.
43Jn 4:48 "Unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders," Jesus told him, "you will never believe."
43Jn 4:49 The royal official said, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
43Jn 4:50 Jesus replied, "You may go. Your son will live." The man took Jesus at his word and departed.
43Jn 4:51 While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.
43Jn 4:52 When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, "The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour."
43Jn 4:53 Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and all his household believed.
43Jn 4:54 This was the second miraculous sign that Jesus performed, having come from Judea to Galilee.
43Jn 5:1 Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for a feast of the Jews.
43Jn 5:2 Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades.
43Jn 5:3 Here a great number of disabled people used to lie--the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.
43Jn 5:4 From time to time an angel of the Lord would come down and stir up the waters. The first one into the pool after each such disturbance would be cured of whatever disease he had.
43Jn 5:5 One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
43Jn 5:6 When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"
43Jn 5:7 "Sir," the invalid replied, "I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me."
43Jn 5:8 Then Jesus said to him, "Get up! Pick up your mat and walk."
43Jn 5:9 At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. The day on which this took place was a Sabbath,
43Jn 5:10 and so the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat."
43Jn 5:11 But he replied, "The man who made me well said to me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"
43Jn 5:12 So they asked him, "Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?"
43Jn 5:13 The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there.
43Jn 5:14 Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, "See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."
43Jn 5:15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
43Jn 5:16 So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jews persecuted him.
43Jn 5:17 Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working."
43Jn 5:18 For this reason the Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
43Jn 5:19 Jesus gave them this answer£º "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.
43Jn 5:20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.
43Jn 5:21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.
43Jn 5:22 Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son,
43Jn 5:23 that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.
43Jn 5:24 "I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.
43Jn 5:25 I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.
43Jn 5:26 For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son to have life in himself.
43Jn 5:27 And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.
43Jn 5:28 "Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice
43Jn 5:29 and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.
43Jn 5:30 By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.
43Jn 5:31 "If I testify about myself, my testimony is not valid.
43Jn 5:32 There is another who testifies in my favor, and I know that his testimony about me is valid.
43Jn 5:33 "You have sent to John and he has testified to the truth.
43Jn 5:34 Not that I accept human testimony; but I mention it that you may be saved.
43Jn 5:35 John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his light.
43Jn 5:36 "I have testimony weightier than that of John. For the very work that the Father has given me to finish, and which I am doing, testifies that the Father has sent me.
43Jn 5:37 And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have never heard his voice nor seen his form,
43Jn 5:38 nor does his word dwell in you, for you do not believe the one he sent.
43Jn 5:39 You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the Scriptures that testify about me,
43Jn 5:40 yet you refuse to come to me to have life.
43Jn 5:41 "I do not accept praise from men,
43Jn 5:42 but I know you. I know that you do not have the love of God in your hearts.
43Jn 5:43 I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me; but if someone else comes in his own name, you will accept him.
43Jn 5:44 How can you believe if you accept praise from one another, yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only God?
43Jn 5:45 "But do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.
43Jn 5:46 If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.
43Jn 5:47 But since you do not believe what he wrote, how are you going to believe what I say?"
43Jn 6:1 Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias),
43Jn 6:2 and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick.
43Jn 6:3 Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples.
43Jn 6:4 The Jewish Passover Feast was near.
43Jn 6:5 When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?"
43Jn 6:6 He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do.
43Jn 6:7 Philip answered him, "Eight months' wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!"
43Jn 6:8 Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up,
43Jn 6:9 "Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?"
43Jn 6:10 Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." There was plenty of grass in that place, and the men sat down, about five thousand of them.
43Jn 6:11 Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish.
43Jn 6:12 When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, "Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted."
43Jn 6:13 So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
43Jn 6:14 After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, "Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."
43Jn 6:15 Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.
43Jn 6:16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake,
43Jn 6:17 where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.
43Jn 6:18 A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough.
43Jn 6:19 When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified.
43Jn 6:20 But he said to them, "It is I; don't be afraid."
43Jn 6:21 Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.
43Jn 6:22 The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone.
43Jn 6:23 Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
43Jn 6:24 Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.
43Jn 6:25 When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"
43Jn 6:26 Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.
43Jn 6:27 Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval."
43Jn 6:28 Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"
43Jn 6:29 Jesus answered, "The work of God is this£º to believe in the one he has sent."
43Jn 6:30 So they asked him, "What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?
43Jn 6:31 Our forefathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written£º 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"
43Jn 6:32 Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
43Jn 6:33 For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
43Jn 6:34 "Sir," they said, "from now on give us this bread."
43Jn 6:35 Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty.
43Jn 6:36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.
43Jn 6:37 All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.
43Jn 6:38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.
43Jn 6:39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.
43Jn 6:40 For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day."
43Jn 6:41 At this the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."
43Jn 6:42 They said, "Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, 'I came down from heaven'?"
43Jn 6:43 "Stop grumbling among yourselves," Jesus answered.
43Jn 6:44 "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.
43Jn 6:45 It is written in the Prophets£º 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me.
43Jn 6:46 No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father.
43Jn 6:47 I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life.
43Jn 6:48 I am the bread of life.
43Jn 6:49 Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died.
43Jn 6:50 But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die.
43Jn 6:51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world."
43Jn 6:52 Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
43Jn 6:53 Jesus said to them, "I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.
43Jn 6:54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
43Jn 6:55 For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink.
43Jn 6:56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.
43Jn 6:57 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me.
43Jn 6:58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever."
43Jn 6:59 He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
43Jn 6:60 On hearing it, many of his disciples said, "This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?"
43Jn 6:61 Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, "Does this offend you?
43Jn 6:62 What if you see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before!
43Jn 6:63 The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.
43Jn 6:64 Yet there are some of you who do not believe." For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him.
43Jn 6:65 He went on to say, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled him."
43Jn 6:66 From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him.
43Jn 6:67 "You do not want to leave too, do you?" Jesus asked the Twelve.
43Jn 6:68 Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.
43Jn 6:69 We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."
43Jn 6:70 Then Jesus replied, "Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!"
43Jn 6:71 (He meant Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray him.)
43Jn 7:1 After this, Jesus went around in Galilee, purposely staying away from Judea because the Jews there were waiting to take his life.
43Jn 7:2 But when the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near,
43Jn 7:3 Jesus' brothers said to him, "You ought to leave here and go to Judea, so that your disciples may see the miracles you do.
43Jn 7:4 No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world."
43Jn 7:5 For even his own brothers did not believe in him.
43Jn 7:6 Therefore Jesus told them, "The right time for me has not yet come; for you any time is right.
43Jn 7:7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that what it does is evil.
43Jn 7:8 You go to the Feast. I am not yet going up to this Feast, because for me the right time has not yet come."
43Jn 7:9 Having said this, he stayed in Galilee.
43Jn 7:10 However, after his brothers had left for the Feast, he went also, not publicly, but in secret.
43Jn 7:11 Now at the Feast the Jews were watching for him and asking, "Where is that man?"
43Jn 7:12 Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others replied, "No, he deceives the people."
43Jn 7:13 But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the Jews.
43Jn 7:14 Not until halfway through the Feast did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach.
43Jn 7:15 The Jews were amazed and asked, "How did this man get such learning without having studied?"
43Jn 7:16 Jesus answered, "My teaching is not my own. It comes from him who sent me.
43Jn 7:17 If anyone chooses to do God's will, he will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.
43Jn 7:18 He who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself, but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.
43Jn 7:19 Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?"
43Jn 7:20 "You are demon-possessed," the crowd answered. "Who is trying to kill you?"
43Jn 7:21 Jesus said to them, "I did one miracle, and you are all astonished.
43Jn 7:22 Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a child on the Sabbath.
43Jn 7:23 Now if a child can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the Sabbath?
43Jn 7:24 Stop judging by mere appearances, and make a right judgment."
43Jn 7:25 At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?
43Jn 7:26 Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Christ?
43Jn 7:27 But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from."
43Jn 7:28 Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him,
43Jn 7:29 but I know him because I am from him and he sent me."
43Jn 7:30 At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come.
43Jn 7:31 Still, many in the crowd put their faith in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more miraculous signs than this man?"
43Jn 7:32 The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him.
43Jn 7:33 Jesus said, "I am with you for only a short time, and then I go to the one who sent me.
43Jn 7:34 You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."
43Jn 7:35 The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?
43Jn 7:36 What did he mean when he said, 'You will look for me, but you will not find me,' and'Where I am, you cannot come'?"
43Jn 7:37 On the last and greatest day of the Feast, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.
43Jn 7:38 Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him."
43Jn 7:39 By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.
43Jn 7:40 On hearing his words, some of the people said, "Surely this man is the Prophet."
43Jn 7:41 Others said, "He is the Christ." Still others asked, "How can the Christ come from Galilee?
43Jn 7:42 Does not the Scripture say that the Christ will come from David's family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?"
43Jn 7:43 Thus the people were divided because of Jesus.
43Jn 7:44 Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.
43Jn 7:45 Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him in?"
43Jn 7:46 "No one ever spoke the way this man does," the guards declared.
43Jn 7:47 "You mean he has deceived you also?" the Pharisees retorted.
43Jn 7:48 "Has any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?
43Jn 7:49 No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law--there is a curse on them."
43Jn 7:50 Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked,
43Jn 7:51 "Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?"
43Jn 7:52 They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee." The earliest and most reliable manuscripts and other ancient witnesses do not have John 7:53-8:11.
43Jn 7:53 Then each went to his own home.
43Jn 8:1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
43Jn 8:2 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.
43Jn 8:3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group
43Jn 8:4 and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
43Jn 8:5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?"
43Jn 8:6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger.
43Jn 8:7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her."
43Jn 8:8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
43Jn 8:9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there.
43Jn 8:10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"
43Jn 8:11 "No one, sir," she said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared. "Go now and leave your life of sin."
43Jn 8:12 When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, "I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."
43Jn 8:13 The Pharisees challenged him, "Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid."
43Jn 8:14 Jesus answered, "Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.
43Jn 8:15 You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.
43Jn 8:16 But if I do judge, my decisions are right, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.
43Jn 8:17 In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.
43Jn 8:18 I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me."
43Jn 8:19 Then they asked him, "Where is your father?" "You do not know me or my Father," Jesus replied. "If you knew me, you would know my Father also."
43Jn 8:20 He spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his time had not yet come.
43Jn 8:21 Once more Jesus said to them, "I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come."
43Jn 8:22 This made the Jews ask, "Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?"
43Jn 8:23 But he continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.
43Jn 8:24 I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins."
43Jn 8:25 "Who are you?" they asked. "Just what I have been claiming all along," Jesus replied.
43Jn 8:26 "I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is reliable, and what I have heard from him I tell the world."
43Jn 8:27 They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.
43Jn 8:28 So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am the one I claim to be and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.
43Jn 8:29 The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him."
43Jn 8:30 Even as he spoke, many put their faith in him.
43Jn 8:31 To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.
43Jn 8:32 Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
43Jn 8:33 They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?"
43Jn 8:34 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.
43Jn 8:35 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.
43Jn 8:36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.
43Jn 8:37 I know you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are ready to kill me, because you have no room for my word.
43Jn 8:38 I am telling you what I have seen in the Father's presence, and you do what you have heard from your father."
43Jn 8:39 "Abraham is our father," they answered. "If you were Abraham's children," said Jesus, "then you would do the things Abraham did.
43Jn 8:40 As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.
43Jn 8:41 You are doing the things your own father does." "We are not illegitimate children," they protested. "The only Father we have is God himself."
43Jn 8:42 Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now am here. I have not come on my own; but he sent me.
43Jn 8:43 Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.
43Jn 8:44 You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
43Jn 8:45 Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!
43Jn 8:46 Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me?
43Jn 8:47 He who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God."
43Jn 8:48 The Jews answered him, "Aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?"
43Jn 8:49 "I am not possessed by a demon," said Jesus, "but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.
43Jn 8:50 I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge.
43Jn 8:51 I tell you the truth, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."
43Jn 8:52 At this the Jews exclaimed, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that if anyone keeps your word, he will never taste death.
43Jn 8:53 Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"
43Jn 8:54 Jesus replied, "If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.
43Jn 8:55 Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and keep his word.
43Jn 8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad."
43Jn 8:57 "You are not yet fifty years old," the Jews said to him, "and you have seen Abraham!"
43Jn 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"
43Jn 8:59 At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
43Jn 9:1 As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth.
43Jn 9:2 His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"
43Jn 9:3 "Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus, "but this happened so that the work of God might be displayed in his life.
43Jn 9:4 As long as it is day, we must do the work of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.
43Jn 9:5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
43Jn 9:6 Having said this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.
43Jn 9:7 "Go," he told him, "wash in the Pool of Siloam" (this word means Sent). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing.
43Jn 9:8 His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, "Isn't this the same man who used to sit and beg?"
43Jn 9:9 Some claimed that he was. Others said, "No, he only looks like him." But he himself insisted, "I am the man."
43Jn 9:10 "How then were your eyes opened?" they demanded.
43Jn 9:11 He replied, "The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see."
43Jn 9:12 "Where is this man?" they asked him. "I don't know," he said.
43Jn 9:13 They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind.
43Jn 9:14 Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man's eyes was a Sabbath.
43Jn 9:15 Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. "He put mud on my eyes," the man replied, "and I washed, and now I see."
43Jn 9:16 Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath." But others asked, "How can a sinner do such miraculous signs?" So they were divided.
43Jn 9:17 Finally they turned again to the blind man, "What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened." The man replied, "He is a prophet."
43Jn 9:18 The Jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man's parents.
43Jn 9:19 "Is this your son?" they asked. "Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?"
43Jn 9:20 "We know he is our son," the parents answered, "and we know he was born blind.
43Jn 9:21 But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don't know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself."
43Jn 9:22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for already the Jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be put out of the synagogue.
43Jn 9:23 That was why his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."
43Jn 9:24 A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. "Give glory to God," they said. "We know this man is a sinner."
43Jn 9:25 He replied, "Whether he is a sinner or not, I don't know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!"
43Jn 9:26 Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"
43Jn 9:27 He answered, "I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"
43Jn 9:28 Then they hurled insults at him and said, "You are this fellow's disciple! We are disciples of Moses!
43Jn 9:29 We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don't even know where he comes from."
43Jn 9:30 The man answered, "Now that is remarkable! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
43Jn 9:31 We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly man who does his will.
43Jn 9:32 Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.
43Jn 9:33 If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."
43Jn 9:34 To this they replied, "You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!" And they threw him out.
43Jn 9:35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
43Jn 9:36 "Who is he, sir?" the man asked. "Tell me so that I may believe in him."
43Jn 9:37 Jesus said, "You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you."
43Jn 9:38 Then the man said, "Lord, I believe," and he worshiped him.
43Jn 9:39 Jesus said, "For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind."
43Jn 9:40 Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, "What? Are we blind too?"
43Jn 9:41 Jesus said, "If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.
43Jn 10:1 "I tell you the truth, the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.
43Jn 10:2 The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep.
43Jn 10:3 The watchman opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
43Jn 10:4 When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.
43Jn 10:5 But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger's voice."
43Jn 10:6 Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was telling them.
43Jn 10:7 Therefore Jesus said again, "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.
43Jn 10:8 All who ever came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.
43Jn 10:9 I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He will come in and go out, and find pasture.
43Jn 10:10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
43Jn 10:11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
43Jn 10:12 The hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.
43Jn 10:13 The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
43Jn 10:14 "I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me--
43Jn 10:15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father--and I lay down my life for the sheep.
43Jn 10:16 I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.
43Jn 10:17 The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life--only to take it up again.
43Jn 10:18 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father."
43Jn 10:19 At these words the Jews were again divided.
43Jn 10:20 Many of them said, "He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?"
43Jn 10:21 But others said, "These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
43Jn 10:22 Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,
43Jn 10:23 and Jesus was in the temple area walking in Solomon's Colonnade.
43Jn 10:24 The Jews gathered around him, saying, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."
43Jn 10:25 Jesus answered, "I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me,
43Jn 10:26 but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.
43Jn 10:27 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
43Jn 10:28 I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.
43Jn 10:29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father's hand.
43Jn 10:30 I and the Father are one."
43Jn 10:31 Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him,
43Jn 10:32 but Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many great miracles from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?"
43Jn 10:33 "We are not stoning you for any of these," replied the Jews, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."
43Jn 10:34 Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'?
43Jn 10:35 If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came--and the Scripture cannot be broken--
43Jn 10:36 what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'?
43Jn 10:37 Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does.
43Jn 10:38 But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."
43Jn 10:39 Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp.
43Jn 10:40 Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. Here he stayed
43Jn 10:41 and many people came to him. They said, "Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was true."
43Jn 10:42 And in that place many believed in Jesus.
43Jn 11:1 Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
43Jn 11:2 This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair.
43Jn 11:3 So the sisters sent word to Jesus, "Lord, the one you love is sick."
43Jn 11:4 When he heard this, Jesus said, "This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified through it."
43Jn 11:5 Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
43Jn 11:6 Yet when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was two more days.
43Jn 11:7 Then he said to his disciples, "Let us go back to Judea."
43Jn 11:8 "But Rabbi," they said, "a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?"
43Jn 11:9 Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by this world's light.
43Jn 11:10 It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light."
43Jn 11:11 After he had said this, he went on to tell them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up."
43Jn 11:12 His disciples replied, "Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better."
43Jn 11:13 Jesus had been speaking of his death, but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep.
43Jn 11:14 So then he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead,
43Jn 11:15 and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."
43Jn 11:16 Then Thomas (called Didymus) said to the rest of the disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."
43Jn 11:17 On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
43Jn 11:18 Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem,
43Jn 11:19 and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother.
43Jn 11:20 When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.
43Jn 11:21 "Lord," Martha said to Jesus, "if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
43Jn 11:22 But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask."
43Jn 11:23 Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
43Jn 11:24 Martha answered, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."
43Jn 11:25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;
43Jn 11:26 and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?"
43Jn 11:27 "Yes, Lord," she told him, "I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world."
43Jn 11:28 And after she had said this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. "The Teacher is here," she said, "and is asking for you."
43Jn 11:29 When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
43Jn 11:30 Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
43Jn 11:31 When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there.
43Jn 11:32 When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."
43Jn 11:33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.
43Jn 11:34 "Where have you laid him?" he asked. "Come and see, Lord," they replied.
43Jn 11:35 Jesus wept.
43Jn 11:36 Then the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"
43Jn 11:37 But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"
43Jn 11:38 Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.
43Jn 11:39 "Take away the stone," he said. "But, Lord," said Martha, the sister of the dead man, "by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days."
43Jn 11:40 Then Jesus said, "Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?"
43Jn 11:41 So they took away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
43Jn 11:42 I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me."
43Jn 11:43 When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
43Jn 11:44 The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, "Take off the grave clothes and let him go."
43Jn 11:45 Therefore many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, put their faith in him.
43Jn 11:46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
43Jn 11:47 Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. "What are we accomplishing?" they asked. "Here is this man performing many miraculous signs.
43Jn 11:48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation."
43Jn 11:49 Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, "You know nothing at all!
43Jn 11:50 You do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish."
43Jn 11:51 He did not say this on his own, but as high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,
43Jn 11:52 and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and make them one.
43Jn 11:53 So from that day on they plotted to take his life.
43Jn 11:54 Therefore Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the Jews. Instead he withdrew to a region near the desert, to a village called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples.
43Jn 11:55 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the country to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.
43Jn 11:56 They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another, "What do you think? Isn't he coming to the Feast at all?"
43Jn 11:57 But the chief priests and Pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where Jesus was, he should report it so that they might arrest him.
43Jn 12:1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived at Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
43Jn 12:2 Here a dinner was given in Jesus' honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him.
43Jn 12:3 Then Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
43Jn 12:4 But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected,
43Jn 12:5 "Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year's wages."
43Jn 12:6 He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it.
43Jn 12:7 "Leave her alone," Jesus replied. "It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.
43Jn 12:8 You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."
43Jn 12:9 Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
43Jn 12:10 So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,
43Jn 12:11 for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.
43Jn 12:12 The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.
43Jn 12:13 They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna!" "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!" "Blessed is the King of Israel!"
43Jn 12:14 Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,
43Jn 12:15 "Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion; see, your king is coming, seated on a donkey's colt."
43Jn 12:16 At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.
43Jn 12:17 Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.
43Jn 12:18 Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him.
43Jn 12:19 So the Pharisees said to one another, "See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!"
43Jn 12:20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.
43Jn 12:21 They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir," they said, "we would like to see Jesus."
43Jn 12:22 Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus.
43Jn 12:23 Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
43Jn 12:24 I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds.
43Jn 12:25 The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
43Jn 12:26 Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will be. My Father will honor the one who serves me.
43Jn 12:27 "Now my heart is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
43Jn 12:28 Father, glorify your name!" Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and will glorify it again."
43Jn 12:29 The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him.
43Jn 12:30 Jesus said, "This voice was for your benefit, not mine.
43Jn 12:31 Now is the time for judgment on this world; now the prince of this world will be driven out.
43Jn 12:32 But I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."
43Jn 12:33 He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die.
43Jn 12:34 The crowd spoke up, "We have heard from the Law that the Christ will remain forever, so how can you say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this 'Son of Man'?"
43Jn 12:35 Then Jesus told them, "You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. The man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.
43Jn 12:36 Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light." When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.
43Jn 12:37 Even after Jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.
43Jn 12:38 This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet£º "Lord, who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"
43Jn 12:39 For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere£º
43Jn 12:40 "He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor turn--and I would heal them."
43Jn 12:41 Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.
43Jn 12:42 Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue;
43Jn 12:43 for they loved praise from men more than praise from God.
43Jn 12:44 Then Jesus cried out, "When a man believes in me, he does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.
43Jn 12:45 When he looks at me, he sees the one who sent me.
43Jn 12:46 I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.
43Jn 12:47 "As for the person who hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge him. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save it.
43Jn 12:48 There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; that very word which I spoke will condemn him at the last day.
43Jn 12:49 For I did not speak of my own accord, but the Father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it.
43Jn 12:50 I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say."
43Jn 13:1 It was just before the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love.
43Jn 13:2 The evening meal was being served, and the devil had already prompted Judas Iscariot, son of Simon, to betray Jesus.
43Jn 13:3 Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God;
43Jn 13:4 so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist.
43Jn 13:5 After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
43Jn 13:6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
43Jn 13:7 Jesus replied, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand."
43Jn 13:8 "No," said Peter, "you shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."
43Jn 13:9 "Then, Lord," Simon Peter replied, "not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!"
43Jn 13:10 Jesus answered, "A person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet; his whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you."
43Jn 13:11 For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean.
43Jn 13:12 When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. "Do you understand what I have done for you?" he asked them.
43Jn 13:13 "You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so, for that is what I am.
43Jn 13:14 Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another's feet.
43Jn 13:15 I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
43Jn 13:16 I tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.
43Jn 13:17 Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
43Jn 13:18 "I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture£º 'He who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'
43Jn 13:19 "I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am He.
43Jn 13:20 I tell you the truth, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me."
43Jn 13:21 After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, "I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me."
43Jn 13:22 His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant.
43Jn 13:23 One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him.
43Jn 13:24 Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, "Ask him which one he means."
43Jn 13:25 Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?"
43Jn 13:26 Jesus answered, "It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish." Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon.
43Jn 13:27 As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. "What you are about to do, do quickly," Jesus told him,
43Jn 13:28 but no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him.
43Jn 13:29 Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the Feast, or to give something to the poor.
43Jn 13:30 As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night.
43Jn 13:31 When he was gone, Jesus said, "Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him.
43Jn 13:32 If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once.
43Jn 13:33 "My children, I will be with you only a little longer. You will look for me, and just as I told the Jews, so I tell you now£º Where I am going, you cannot come.
43Jn 13:34 "A new command I give you£º Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.
43Jn 13:35 By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."
43Jn 13:36 Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus replied, "Where I am going, you cannot follow now, but you will follow later."
43Jn 13:37 Peter asked, "Lord, why can't I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you."
43Jn 13:38 Then Jesus answered, "Will you really lay down your life for me? I tell you the truth, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times!
43Jn 14:1 "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.
43Jn 14:2 In my Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you.
43Jn 14:3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.
43Jn 14:4 You know the way to the place where I am going."
43Jn 14:5 Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?"
43Jn 14:6 Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
43Jn 14:7 If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him."
43Jn 14:8 Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us."
43Jn 14:9 Jesus answered£º "Don't you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, 'Show us the Father'?
43Jn 14:10 Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.
43Jn 14:11 Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves.
43Jn 14:12 I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.
43Jn 14:13 And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.
43Jn 14:14 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.
43Jn 14:15 "If you love me, you will obey what I command.
43Jn 14:16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever--
43Jn 14:17 the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.
43Jn 14:18 I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.
43Jn 14:19 Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.
43Jn 14:20 On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.
43Jn 14:21 Whoever has my commands and obeys them, he is the one who loves me. He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him."
43Jn 14:22 Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, "But, Lord, why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?"
43Jn 14:23 Jesus replied, "If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.
43Jn 14:24 He who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.
43Jn 14:25 "All this I have spoken while still with you.
43Jn 14:26 But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
43Jn 14:27 Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.
43Jn 14:28 "You heard me say, 'I am going away and I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would be glad that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.
43Jn 14:29 I have told you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.
43Jn 14:30 I will not speak with you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no hold on me,
43Jn 14:31 but the world must learn that I love the Father and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me. "Come now; let us leave.
43Jn 15:1 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
43Jn 15:2 He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful.
43Jn 15:3 You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
43Jn 15:4 Remain in me, and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.
43Jn 15:5 "I am the vine; you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.
43Jn 15:6 If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.
43Jn 15:7 If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you.
43Jn 15:8 This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.
43Jn 15:9 "As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love.
43Jn 15:10 If you obey my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and remain in his love.
43Jn 15:11 I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.
43Jn 15:12 My command is this£º Love each other as I have loved you.
43Jn 15:13 Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.
43Jn 15:14 You are my friends if you do what I command.
43Jn 15:15 I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know his master's business. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything that I learned from my Father I have made known to you.
43Jn 15:16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit--fruit that will last. Then the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.
43Jn 15:17 This is my command£º Love each other.
43Jn 15:18 "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.
43Jn 15:19 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you.
43Jn 15:20 Remember the words I spoke to you£º 'No servant is greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.
43Jn 15:21 They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me.
43Jn 15:22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin.
43Jn 15:23 He who hates me hates my Father as well.
43Jn 15:24 If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father.
43Jn 15:25 But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law£º 'They hated me without reason.'
43Jn 15:26 "When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me.
43Jn 15:27 And you also must testify, for you have been with me from the beginning.
43Jn 16:1 "All this I have told you so that you will not go astray.
43Jn 16:2 They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to God.
43Jn 16:3 They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.
43Jn 16:4 I have told you this, so that when the time comes you will remember that I warned you. I did not tell you this at first because I was with you.
43Jn 16:5 "Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'
43Jn 16:6 Because I have said these things, you are filled with grief.
43Jn 16:7 But I tell you the truth£º It is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.
43Jn 16:8 When he comes, he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment£º
43Jn 16:9 in regard to sin, because men do not believe in me;
43Jn 16:10 in regard to righteousness, because I am going to the Father, where you can see me no longer;
43Jn 16:11 and in regard to judgment, because the prince of this world now stands condemned.
43Jn 16:12 "I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear.
43Jn 16:13 But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.
43Jn 16:14 He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you.
43Jn 16:15 All that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you.
43Jn 16:16 "In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me."
43Jn 16:17 Some of his disciples said to one another, "What does he mean by saying, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,' and'Because I am going to the Father'?"
43Jn 16:18 They kept asking, "What does he mean by'a little while'? We don't understand what he is saying."
43Jn 16:19 Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, "Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, 'In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me'?
43Jn 16:20 I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.
43Jn 16:21 A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.
43Jn 16:22 So with you£º Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and you will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.
43Jn 16:23 In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.
43Jn 16:24 Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.
43Jn 16:25 "Though I have been speaking figuratively, a time is coming when I will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my Father.
43Jn 16:26 In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.
43Jn 16:27 No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.
43Jn 16:28 I came from the Father and entered the world; now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father."
43Jn 16:29 Then Jesus' disciples said, "Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech.
43Jn 16:30 Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God."
43Jn 16:31 "You believe at last!" Jesus answered.
43Jn 16:32 "But a time is coming, and has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.
43Jn 16:33 "I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world."
43Jn 17:1 After Jesus said this, he looked toward heaven and prayed£º "Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.
43Jn 17:2 For you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him.
43Jn 17:3 Now this is eternal life£º that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
43Jn 17:4 I have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.
43Jn 17:5 And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.
43Jn 17:6 "I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word.
43Jn 17:7 Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.
43Jn 17:8 For I gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them. They knew with certainty that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
43Jn 17:9 I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those you have given me, for they are yours.
43Jn 17:10 All I have is yours, and all you have is mine. And glory has come to me through them.
43Jn 17:11 I will remain in the world no longer, but they are still in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by the power of your name--the name you gave me--so that they may be one as we are one.
43Jn 17:12 While I was with them, I protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me. None has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that Scripture would be fulfilled.
43Jn 17:13 "I am coming to you now, but I say these things while I am still in the world, so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them.
43Jn 17:14 I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.
43Jn 17:15 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one.
43Jn 17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.
43Jn 17:17 Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.
43Jn 17:18 As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world.
43Jn 17:19 For them I sanctify myself, that they too may be truly sanctified.
43Jn 17:20 "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,
43Jn 17:21 that all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
43Jn 17:22 I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one£º
43Jn 17:23 I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me.
43Jn 17:24 "Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, and to see my glory, the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world.
43Jn 17:25 "Righteous Father, though the world does not know you, I know you, and they know that you have sent me.
43Jn 17:26 I have made you known to them, and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that I myself may be in them."
43Jn 18:1 When he had finished praying, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was an olive grove, and he and his disciples went into it.
43Jn 18:2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.
43Jn 18:3 So Judas came to the grove, guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns and weapons.
43Jn 18:4 Jesus, knowing all that was going to happen to him, went out and asked them, "Who is it you want?"
43Jn 18:5 "Jesus of Nazareth," they replied. "I am he," Jesus said. (And Judas the traitor was standing there with them.)
43Jn 18:6 When Jesus said, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground.
43Jn 18:7 Again he asked them, "Who is it you want?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."
43Jn 18:8 "I told you that I am he," Jesus answered. "If you are looking for me, then let these men go."
43Jn 18:9 This happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled£º "I have not lost one of those you gave me."
43Jn 18:10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. (The servant's name was Malchus.)
43Jn 18:11 Jesus commanded Peter, "Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?"
43Jn 18:12 Then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus. They bound him
43Jn 18:13 and brought him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.
43Jn 18:14 Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be good if one man died for the people.
43Jn 18:15 Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest's courtyard,
43Jn 18:16 but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in.
43Jn 18:17 "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, "I am not."
43Jn 18:18 It was cold, and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.
43Jn 18:19 Meanwhile, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.
43Jn 18:20 "I have spoken openly to the world," Jesus replied. "I always taught in synagogues or at the temple, where all the Jews come together. I said nothing in secret.
43Jn 18:21 Why question me? Ask those who heard me. Surely they know what I said."
43Jn 18:22 When Jesus said this, one of the officials nearby struck him in the face. "Is this the way you answer the high priest?" he demanded.
43Jn 18:23 "If I said something wrong," Jesus replied, "testify as to what is wrong. But if I spoke the truth, why did you strike me?"
43Jn 18:24 Then Annas sent him, still bound, to Caiaphas the high priest.
43Jn 18:25 As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, "You are not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "I am not."
43Jn 18:26 One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, "Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?"
43Jn 18:27 Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow.
43Jn 18:28 Then the Jews led Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. By now it was early morning, and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the Jews did not enter the palace; they wanted to be able to eat the Passover.
43Jn 18:29 So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What charges are you bringing against this man?"
43Jn 18:30 "If he were not a criminal," they replied, "we would not have handed him over to you."
43Jn 18:31 Pilate said, "Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law." "But we have no right to execute anyone," the Jews objected.
43Jn 18:32 This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled.
43Jn 18:33 Pilate then went back inside the palace, summoned Jesus and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
43Jn 18:34 "Is that your own idea," Jesus asked, "or did others talk to you about me?"
43Jn 18:35 "Am I a Jew?" Pilate replied. "It was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me. What is it you have done?"
43Jn 18:36 Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. But now my kingdom is from another place."
43Jn 18:37 "You are a king, then!" said Pilate. Jesus answered, "You are right in saying I am a king. In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me."
43Jn 18:38 "What is truth?" Pilate asked. With this he went out again to the Jews and said, "I find no basis for a charge against him.
43Jn 18:39 But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you want me to release 'the king of the Jews'?"
43Jn 18:40 They shouted back, "No, not him! Give us Barabbas!" Now Barabbas had taken part in a rebellion.
43Jn 19:1 Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged.
43Jn 19:2 The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe
43Jn 19:3 and went up to him again and again, saying, "Hail, king of the Jews!" And they struck him in the face.
43Jn 19:4 Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him."
43Jn 19:5 When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
43Jn 19:6 As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify! Crucify!" But Pilate answered, "You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him."
43Jn 19:7 The Jews insisted, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God."
43Jn 19:8 When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid,
43Jn 19:9 and he went back inside the palace. "Where do you come from?" he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer.
43Jn 19:10 "Do you refuse to speak to me?" Pilate said. "Don't you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?"
43Jn 19:11 Jesus answered, "You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin."
43Jn 19:12 From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."
43Jn 19:13 When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha).
43Jn 19:14 It was the day of Preparation of Passover Week, about the sixth hour. "Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.
43Jn 19:15 But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" "Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.
43Jn 19:16 Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. So the soldiers took charge of Jesus.
43Jn 19:17 Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha).
43Jn 19:18 Here they crucified him, and with him two others--one on each side and Jesus in the middle.
43Jn 19:19 Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read£º JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
43Jn 19:20 Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek.
43Jn 19:21 The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."
43Jn 19:22 Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."
43Jn 19:23 When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
43Jn 19:24 "Let's not tear it," they said to one another. "Let's decide by lot who will get it." This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said, "They divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing." So this is what the soldiers did.
43Jn 19:25 Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
43Jn 19:26 When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, "Dear woman, here is your son,"
43Jn 19:27 and to the disciple, "Here is your mother." From that time on, this disciple took her into his home.
43Jn 19:28 Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty."
43Jn 19:29 A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus' lips.
43Jn 19:30 When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.
43Jn 19:31 Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down.
43Jn 19:32 The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other.
43Jn 19:33 But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
43Jn 19:34 Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus' side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water.
43Jn 19:35 The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe.
43Jn 19:36 These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled£º "Not one of his bones will be broken,"
43Jn 19:37 and, as another scripture says, "They will look on the one they have pierced."
43Jn 19:38 Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate's permission, he came and took the body away.
43Jn 19:39 He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.
43Jn 19:40 Taking Jesus' body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs.
43Jn 19:41 At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
43Jn 19:42 Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
43Jn 20:1 Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.
43Jn 20:2 So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"
43Jn 20:3 So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb.
43Jn 20:4 Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
43Jn 20:5 He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in.
43Jn 20:6 Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there,
43Jn 20:7 as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen.
43Jn 20:8 Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.
43Jn 20:9 (They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.)
43Jn 20:10 Then the disciples went back to their homes,
43Jn 20:11 but Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb
43Jn 20:12 and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus' body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.
43Jn 20:13 They asked her, "Woman, why are you crying?" "They have taken my Lord away," she said, "and I don't know where they have put him."
43Jn 20:14 At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus.
43Jn 20:15 "Woman," he said, "why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him."
43Jn 20:16 Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher).
43Jn 20:17 Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet returned to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
43Jn 20:18 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news£º "I have seen the Lord!" And she told them that he had said these things to her.
43Jn 20:19 On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"
43Jn 20:20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.
43Jn 20:21 Again Jesus said, "Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you."
43Jn 20:22 And with that he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
43Jn 20:23 If you forgive anyone his sins, they are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."
43Jn 20:24 Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.
43Jn 20:25 So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he said to them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it."
43Jn 20:26 A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, "Peace be with you!"
43Jn 20:27 Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe."
43Jn 20:28 Thomas said to him, "My Lord and my God!"
43Jn 20:29 Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."
43Jn 20:30 Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.
43Jn 20:31 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
43Jn 21:1 Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Tiberias. It happened this way£º
43Jn 21:2 Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.
43Jn 21:3 "I'm going out to fish," Simon Peter told them, and they said, "We'll go with you." So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
43Jn 21:4 Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.
43Jn 21:5 He called out to them, "Friends, haven't you any fish?" "No," they answered.
43Jn 21:6 He said, "Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some." When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish.
43Jn 21:7 Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, "It is the Lord," he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water.
43Jn 21:8 The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.
43Jn 21:9 When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread.
43Jn 21:10 Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have just caught."
43Jn 21:11 Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn.
43Jn 21:12 Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." None of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.
43Jn 21:13 Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
43Jn 21:14 This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.
43Jn 21:15 When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me more than these?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."
43Jn 21:16 Again Jesus said, "Simon son of John, do you truly love me?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."
43Jn 21:17 The third time he said to him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" He said, "Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you." Jesus said, "Feed my sheep.
43Jn 21:18 I tell you the truth, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go."
43Jn 21:19 Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, "Follow me!"
43Jn 21:20 Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is going to betray you?")
43Jn 21:21 When Peter saw him, he asked, "Lord, what about him?"
43Jn 21:22 Jesus answered, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me."
43Jn 21:23 Because of this, the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?"
43Jn 21:24 This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
43Jn 21:25 Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
