111Kg 1:1 When King David was old and well advanced in years, he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him.
111Kg 1:2 So his servants said to him, "Let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him. She can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm."
111Kg 1:3 Then they searched throughout Israel for a beautiful girl and found Abishag, a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
111Kg 1:4 The girl was very beautiful; she took care of the king and waited on him, but the king had no intimate relations with her.
111Kg 1:5 Now Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, put himself forward and said, "I will be king." So he got chariots and horses ready, with fifty men to run ahead of him.
111Kg 1:6 (His father had never interfered with him by asking, "Why do you behave as you do?" He was also very handsome and was born next after Absalom.)
111Kg 1:7 Adonijah conferred with Joab son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest, and they gave him their support.
111Kg 1:8 But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei and Rei and David's special guard did not join Adonijah.
111Kg 1:9 Adonijah then sacrificed sheep, cattle and fattened calves at the Stone of Zoheleth near En Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah who were royal officials,
111Kg 1:10 but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the special guard or his brother Solomon.
111Kg 1:11 Then Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, "Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has become king without our lord David's knowing it?
111Kg 1:12 Now then, let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.
111Kg 1:13 Go in to King David and say to him, 'My lord the king, did you not swear to me your servant£º "Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah become king?'
111Kg 1:14 While you are still there talking to the king, I will come in and confirm what you have said."
111Kg 1:15 So Bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room, where Abishag the Shunammite was attending him.
111Kg 1:16 Bathsheba bowed low and knelt before the king. "What is it you want?" the king asked.
111Kg 1:17 She said to him, "My lord, you yourself swore to me your servant by the LORD your God£º 'Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne.'
111Kg 1:18 But now Adonijah has become king, and you, my lord the king, do not know about it.
111Kg 1:19 He has sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and has invited all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant.
111Kg 1:20 My lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
111Kg 1:21 Otherwise, as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his fathers, I and my son Solomon will be treated as criminals."
111Kg 1:22 While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
111Kg 1:23 And they told the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." So he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground.
111Kg 1:24 Nathan said, "Have you, my lord the king, declared that Adonijah shall be king after you, and that he will sit on your throne?
111Kg 1:25 Today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle, fattened calves, and sheep. He has invited all the king's sons, the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
111Kg 1:26 But me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he did not invite.
111Kg 1:27 Is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
111Kg 1:28 Then King David said, "Call in Bathsheba." So she came into the king's presence and stood before him.
111Kg 1:29 The king then took an oath£º "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of every trouble,
111Kg 1:30 I will surely carry out today what I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel£º Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he will sit on my throne in my place."
111Kg 1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed low with her face to the ground and, kneeling before the king, said, "May my lord King David live forever!"
111Kg 1:32 King David said, "Call in Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." When they came before the king,
111Kg 1:33 he said to them£º "Take your lord's servants with you and set Solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to Gihon.
111Kg 1:34 There have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, 'Long live King Solomon!'
111Kg 1:35 Then you are to go up with him, and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place. I have appointed him ruler over Israel and Judah."
111Kg 1:36 Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, so declare it.
111Kg 1:37 As the LORD was with my lord the king, so may he be with Solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord King David!"
111Kg 1:38 So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites went down and put Solomon on King David's mule and escorted him to Gihon.
111Kg 1:39 Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon. Then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted, "Long live King Solomon!"
111Kg 1:40 And all the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing greatly, so that the ground shook with the sound.
111Kg 1:41 Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast. On hearing the sound of the trumpet, Joab asked, "What's the meaning of all the noise in the city?"
111Kg 1:42 Even as he was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, "Come in. A worthy man like you must be bringing good news."
111Kg 1:43 "Not at all!" Jonathan answered. "Our lord King David has made Solomon king.
111Kg 1:44 The king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and they have put him on the king's mule,
111Kg 1:45 and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon. From there they have gone up cheering, and the city resounds with it. That's the noise you hear.
111Kg 1:46 Moreover, Solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne.
111Kg 1:47 Also, the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord King David, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours!' And the king bowed in worship on his bed
111Kg 1:48 and said, 'Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today.'"
111Kg 1:49 At this, all Adonijah's guests rose in alarm and dispersed.
111Kg 1:50 But Adonijah, in fear of Solomon, went and took hold of the horns of the altar.
111Kg 1:51 Then Solomon was told, "Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar. He says, 'Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.'"
111Kg 1:52 Solomon replied, "If he shows himself to be a worthy man, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground; but if evil is found in him, he will die."
111Kg 1:53 Then King Solomon sent men, and they brought him down from the altar. And Adonijah came and bowed down to King Solomon, and Solomon said, "Go to your home."
111Kg 2:1 When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son.
111Kg 2:2 "I am about to go the way of all the earth," he said. "So be strong, show yourself a man,
111Kg 2:3 and observe what the LORD your God requires£º Walk in his ways, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and requirements, as written in the Law of Moses, so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go,
111Kg 2:4 and that the LORD may keep his promise to me£º 'If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'
111Kg 2:5 "Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me--what he did to the two commanders of Israel's armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet.
111Kg 2:6 Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace.
111Kg 2:7 "But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
111Kg 2:8 "And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD£º 'I will not put you to death by the sword.'
111Kg 2:9 But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood."
111Kg 2:10 Then David rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David.
111Kg 2:11 He had reigned forty years over Israel--seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
111Kg 2:12 So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established.
111Kg 2:13 Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. Bathsheba asked him, "Do you come peacefully?" He answered, "Yes, peacefully."
111Kg 2:14 Then he added, "I have something to say to you." "You may say it," she replied.
111Kg 2:15 "As you know," he said, "the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the LORD.
111Kg 2:16 Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me." "You may make it," she said.
111Kg 2:17 So he continued, "Please ask King Solomon--he will not refuse you--to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife."
111Kg 2:18 "Very well," Bathsheba replied, "I will speak to the king for you."
111Kg 2:19 When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king's mother, and she sat down at his right hand.
111Kg 2:20 "I have one small request to make of you," she said. "Do not refuse me." The king replied, "Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you."
111Kg 2:21 So she said, "Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah."
111Kg 2:22 King Solomon answered his mother, "Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him--after all, he is my older brother--yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!"
111Kg 2:23 Then King Solomon swore by the LORD£º "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request!
111Kg 2:24 And now, as surely as the LORD lives--he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised--Adonijah shall be put to death today!"
111Kg 2:25 So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died.
111Kg 2:26 To Abiathar the priest the king said, "Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign LORD before my father David and shared all my father's hardships."
111Kg 2:27 So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the LORD, fulfilling the word the LORD had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli.
111Kg 2:28 When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the LORD and took hold of the horns of the altar.
111Kg 2:29 King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the LORD and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, "Go, strike him down!"
111Kg 2:30 So Benaiah entered the tent of the LORD and said to Joab, "The king says, 'Come out!'" But he answered, "No, I will die here." Benaiah reported to the king, "This is how Joab answered me."
111Kg 2:31 Then the king commanded Benaiah, "Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my father's house of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed.
111Kg 2:32 The LORD will repay him for the blood he shed, because without the knowledge of my father David he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them--Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel's army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah's army--were better men and more upright than he.
111Kg 2:33 May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the LORD'S peace forever."
111Kg 2:34 So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried on his own land in the desert.
111Kg 2:35 The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab's position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest.
111Kg 2:36 Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else.
111Kg 2:37 The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head."
111Kg 2:38 Shimei answered the king, "What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said." And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time.
111Kg 2:39 But three years later, two of Shimei's slaves ran off to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, "Your slaves are in Gath."
111Kg 2:40 At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath.
111Kg 2:41 When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned,
111Kg 2:42 the king summoned Shimei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD and warn you, 'On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die'? At that time you said to me, 'What you say is good. I will obey.'
111Kg 2:43 Why then did you not keep your oath to the LORD and obey the command I gave you?"
111Kg 2:44 The king also said to Shimei, "You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the LORD will repay you for your wrongdoing.
111Kg 2:45 But King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will remain secure before the LORD forever."
111Kg 2:46 Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and killed him. The kingdom was now firmly established in Solomon's hands.
111Kg 3:1 Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt and married his daughter. He brought her to the City of David until he finished building his palace and the temple of the LORD, and the wall around Jerusalem.
111Kg 3:2 The people, however, were still sacrificing at the high places, because a temple had not yet been built for the Name of the LORD.
111Kg 3:3 Solomon showed his love for the LORD by walking according to the statutes of his father David, except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places.
111Kg 3:4 The king went to Gibeon to offer sacrifices, for that was the most important high place, and Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.
111Kg 3:5 At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon during the night in a dream, and God said, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."
111Kg 3:6 Solomon answered, "You have shown great kindness to your servant, my father David, because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart. You have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day.
111Kg 3:7 "Now, O LORD my God, you have made your servant king in place of my father David. But I am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties.
111Kg 3:8 Your servant is here among the people you have chosen, a great people, too numerous to count or number.
111Kg 3:9 So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong. For who is able to govern this great people of yours?"
111Kg 3:10 The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this.
111Kg 3:11 So God said to him, "Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice,
111Kg 3:12 I will do what you have asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like you, nor will there ever be.
111Kg 3:13 Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for--both riches and honor--so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings.
111Kg 3:14 And if you walk in my ways and obey my statutes and commands as David your father did, I will give you a long life."
111Kg 3:15 Then Solomon awoke--and he realized it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord's covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then he gave a feast for all his court.
111Kg 3:16 Now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
111Kg 3:17 One of them said, "My lord, this woman and I live in the same house. I had a baby while she was there with me.
111Kg 3:18 The third day after my child was born, this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there was no one in the house but the two of us.
111Kg 3:19 "During the night this woman's son died because she lay on him.
111Kg 3:20 So she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while I your servant was asleep. She put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast.
111Kg 3:21 The next morning, I got up to nurse my son--and he was dead! But when I looked at him closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn't the son I had borne."
111Kg 3:22 The other woman said, "No! The living one is my son; the dead one is yours." But the first one insisted, "No! The dead one is yours; the living one is mine." And so they argued before the king.
111Kg 3:23 The king said, "This one says, 'My son is alive and your son is dead,' while that one says, 'No! Your son is dead and mine is alive.'"
111Kg 3:24 Then the king said, "Bring me a sword." So they brought a sword for the king.
111Kg 3:25 He then gave an order£º "Cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other."
111Kg 3:26 The woman whose son was alive was filled with compassion for her son and said to the king, "Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don't kill him!" But the other said, "Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!"
111Kg 3:27 Then the king gave his ruling£º "Give the living baby to the first woman. Do not kill him; she is his mother."
111Kg 3:28 When all Israel heard the verdict the king had given, they held the king in awe, because they saw that he had wisdom from God to administer justice.
111Kg 4:1 So King Solomon ruled over all Israel.
111Kg 4:2 And these were his chief officials£º Azariah son of Zadok--the priest;
111Kg 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha--secretaries; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud--recorder;
111Kg 4:4 Benaiah son of Jehoiada--commander in chief; Zadok and Abiathar--priests;
111Kg 4:5 Azariah son of Nathan--in charge of the district officers; Zabud son of Nathan--a priest and personal adviser to the king;
111Kg 4:6 Ahishar--in charge of the palace; Adoniram son of Abda--in charge of forced labor.
111Kg 4:7 Solomon also had twelve district governors over all Israel, who supplied provisions for the king and the royal household. Each one had to provide supplies for one month in the year.
111Kg 4:8 These are their names£º Ben-Hur--in the hill country of Ephraim;
111Kg 4:9 Ben-Deker--in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh and Elon Bethhanan;
111Kg 4:10 Ben-Hesed--in Arubboth (Socoh and all the land of Hepher were his);
111Kg 4:11 Ben-Abinadab--in Naphoth Dor (he was married to Taphath daughter of Solomon);
111Kg 4:12 Baana son of Ahilud--in Taanach and Megiddo, and in all of Beth Shan next to Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth Shan to Abel Meholah across to Jokmeam;
111Kg 4:13 Ben-Geber--in Ramoth Gilead (the settlements of Jair son of Manasseh in Gilead were his, as well as the district of Argob in Bashan and its sixty large walled cities with bronze gate bars);
111Kg 4:14 Ahinadab son of Iddo--in Mahanaim;
111Kg 4:15 Ahimaaz--in Naphtali (he had married Basemath daughter of Solomon);
111Kg 4:16 Baana son of Hushai--in Asher and in Aloth;
111Kg 4:17 Jehoshaphat son of Paruah--in Issachar;
111Kg 4:18 Shimei son of Ela--in Benjamin;
111Kg 4:19 Geber son of Uri--in Gilead (the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and the country of Og king of Bashan). He was the only governor over the district.
111Kg 4:20 The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore; they ate, they drank and they were happy.
111Kg 4:21 And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These countries brought tribute and were Solomon's subjects all his life.
111Kg 4:22 Solomon's daily provisions were thirty cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal,
111Kg 4:23 ten head of stall-fed cattle, twenty of pasture-fed cattle and a hundred sheep and goats, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks and choice fowl.
111Kg 4:24 For he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the River, from Tiphsah to Gaza, and had peace on all sides.
111Kg 4:25 During Solomon's lifetime Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, lived in safety, each man under his own vine and fig tree.
111Kg 4:26 Solomon had four thousand stalls for chariot horses, and twelve thousand horses.
111Kg 4:27 The district officers, each in his month, supplied provisions for King Solomon and all who came to the king's table. They saw to it that nothing was lacking.
111Kg 4:28 They also brought to the proper place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and the other horses.
111Kg 4:29 God gave Solomon wisdom and very great insight, and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore.
111Kg 4:30 Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the men of the East, and greater than all the wisdom of Egypt.
111Kg 4:31 He was wiser than any other man, including Ethan the Ezrahite--wiser than Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol. And his fame spread to all the surrounding nations.
111Kg 4:32 He spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five.
111Kg 4:33 He described plant life, from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls. He also taught about animals and birds, reptiles and fish.
111Kg 4:34 Men of all nations came to listen to Solomon's wisdom, sent by all the kings of the world, who had heard of his wisdom.
111Kg 5:1 When Hiram king of Tyre heard that Solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father David, he sent his envoys to Solomon, because he had always been on friendly terms with David.
111Kg 5:2 Solomon sent back this message to Hiram£º
111Kg 5:3 "You know that because of the wars waged against my father David from all sides, he could not build a temple for the Name of the LORD his God until the LORD put his enemies under his feet.
111Kg 5:4 But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or disaster.
111Kg 5:5 I intend, therefore, to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God, as the LORD told my father David, when he said, 'Your son whom I will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my Name.'
111Kg 5:6 "So give orders that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. My men will work with yours, and I will pay you for your men whatever wages you set. You know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the Sidonians."
111Kg 5:7 When Hiram heard Solomon's message, he was greatly pleased and said, "Praise be to the LORD today, for he has given David a wise son to rule over this great nation."
111Kg 5:8 So Hiram sent word to Solomon£º "I have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and pine logs.
111Kg 5:9 My men will haul them down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will float them in rafts by sea to the place you specify. There I will separate them and you can take them away. And you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household."
111Kg 5:10 In this way Hiram kept Solomon supplied with all the cedar and pine logs he wanted,
111Kg 5:11 and Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, in addition to twenty thousand baths of pressed olive oil. Solomon continued to do this for Hiram year after year.
111Kg 5:12 The LORD gave Solomon wisdom, just as he had promised him. There were peaceful relations between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty.
111Kg 5:13 King Solomon conscripted laborers from all Israel--thirty thousand men.
111Kg 5:14 He sent them off to Lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month, so that they spent one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor.
111Kg 5:15 Solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills,
111Kg 5:16 as well as thirty-three hundred foremen who supervised the project and directed the workmen.
111Kg 5:17 At the king's command they removed from the quarry large blocks of quality stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple.
111Kg 5:18 The craftsmen of Solomon and Hiram and the men of Gebal cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple.
111Kg 6:1 In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the temple of the LORD.
111Kg 6:2 The temple that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty wide and thirty high.
111Kg 6:3 The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple, that is twenty cubits, and projected ten cubits from the front of the temple.
111Kg 6:4 He made narrow clerestory windows in the temple.
111Kg 6:5 Against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building, in which there were side rooms.
111Kg 6:6 The lowest floor was five cubits wide, the middle floor six cubits and the third floor seven. He made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls.
111Kg 6:7 In building the temple, only blocks dressed at the quarry were used, and no hammer, chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built.
111Kg 6:8 The entrance to the lowest floor was on the south side of the temple; a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third.
111Kg 6:9 So he built the temple and completed it, roofing it with beams and cedar planks.
111Kg 6:10 And he built the side rooms all along the temple. The height of each was five cubits, and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar.
111Kg 6:11 The word of the LORD came to Solomon£º
111Kg 6:12 "As for this temple you are building, if you follow my decrees, carry out my regulations and keep all my commands and obey them, I will fulfill through you the promise I gave to David your father.
111Kg 6:13 And I will live among the Israelites and will not abandon my people Israel."
111Kg 6:14 So Solomon built the temple and completed it.
111Kg 6:15 He lined its interior walls with cedar boards, paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and covered the floor of the temple with planks of pine.
111Kg 6:16 He partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.
111Kg 6:17 The main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long.
111Kg 6:18 The inside of the temple was cedar, carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; no stone was to be seen.
111Kg 6:19 He prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there.
111Kg 6:20 The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty wide and twenty high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.
111Kg 6:21 Solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.
111Kg 6:22 So he overlaid the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
111Kg 6:23 In the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
111Kg 6:24 One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing five cubits--ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip.
111Kg 6:25 The second cherub also measured ten cubits, for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape.
111Kg 6:26 The height of each cherub was ten cubits.
111Kg 6:27 He placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple, with their wings spread out. The wing of one cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the other touched the other wall, and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room.
111Kg 6:28 He overlaid the cherubim with gold.
111Kg 6:29 On the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer rooms, he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers.
111Kg 6:30 He also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold.
111Kg 6:31 For the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood with five-sided jambs.
111Kg 6:32 And on the two olive wood doors he carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with beaten gold.
111Kg 6:33 In the same way he made four-sided jambs of olive wood for the entrance to the main hall.
111Kg 6:34 He also made two pine doors, each having two leaves that turned in sockets.
111Kg 6:35 He carved cherubim, palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings.
111Kg 6:36 And he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams.
111Kg 6:37 The foundation of the temple of the LORD was laid in the fourth year, in the month of Ziv.
111Kg 6:38 In the eleventh year in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications. He had spent seven years building it.
111Kg 7:1 It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace.
111Kg 7:2 He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high, with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams.
111Kg 7:3 It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns--forty-five beams, fifteen to a row.
111Kg 7:4 Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other.
111Kg 7:5 All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other.
111Kg 7:6 He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide. In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof.
111Kg 7:7 He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.
111Kg 7:8 And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married.
111Kg 7:9 All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and trimmed with a saw on their inner and outer faces.
111Kg 7:10 The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits and some eight.
111Kg 7:11 Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams.
111Kg 7:12 The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the LORD with its portico.
111Kg 7:13 King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram,
111Kg 7:14 whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was a man of Tyre and a craftsman in bronze. Huram was highly skilled and experienced in all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him.
111Kg 7:15 He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits around, by line.
111Kg 7:16 He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits high.
111Kg 7:17 A network of interwoven chains festooned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital.
111Kg 7:18 He made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars. He did the same for each capital.
111Kg 7:19 The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits high.
111Kg 7:20 On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around.
111Kg 7:21 He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.
111Kg 7:22 The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed.
111Kg 7:23 He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.
111Kg 7:24 Below the rim, gourds encircled it--ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.
111Kg 7:25 The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.
111Kg 7:26 It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.
111Kg 7:27 He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high.
111Kg 7:28 This is how the stands were made£º They had side panels attached to uprights.
111Kg 7:29 On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim--and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work.
111Kg 7:30 Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side.
111Kg 7:31 On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half. Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round.
111Kg 7:32 The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half.
111Kg 7:33 The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal.
111Kg 7:34 Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand.
111Kg 7:35 At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand.
111Kg 7:36 He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around.
111Kg 7:37 This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape.
111Kg 7:38 He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands.
111Kg 7:39 He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple.
111Kg 7:40 He also made the basins and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished all the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of the LORD£º
111Kg 7:41 the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
111Kg 7:42 the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);
111Kg 7:43 the ten stands with their ten basins;
111Kg 7:44 the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
111Kg 7:45 the pots, shovels and sprinkling bowls. All these objects that Huram made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of burnished bronze.
111Kg 7:46 The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
111Kg 7:47 Solomon left all these things unweighed, because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.
111Kg 7:48 Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the LORD'S temple£º the golden altar; the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;
111Kg 7:49 the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary); the gold floral work and lamps and tongs;
111Kg 7:50 the pure gold basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room, the Most Holy Place, and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple.
111Kg 7:51 When all the work King Solomon had done for the temple of the LORD was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated--the silver and gold and the furnishings--and he placed them in the treasuries of the LORD'S temple.
111Kg 8:1 Then King Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the LORD'S covenant from Zion, the City of David.
111Kg 8:2 All the men of Israel came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month.
111Kg 8:3 When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark,
111Kg 8:4 and they brought up the ark of the LORD and the Tent of Meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests and Levites carried them up,
111Kg 8:5 and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.
111Kg 8:6 The priests then brought the ark of the LORD'S covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.
111Kg 8:7 The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles.
111Kg 8:8 These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today.
111Kg 8:9 There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.
111Kg 8:10 When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the LORD.
111Kg 8:11 And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled his temple.
111Kg 8:12 Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;
111Kg 8:13 I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever."
111Kg 8:14 While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them.
111Kg 8:15 Then he said£º "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said,
111Kg 8:16 'Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built for my Name to be there, but I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.'
111Kg 8:17 "My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
111Kg 8:18 But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name, you did well to have this in your heart.
111Kg 8:19 Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, who is your own flesh and blood--he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.'
111Kg 8:20 "The LORD has kept the promise he made£º I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
111Kg 8:21 I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with our fathers when he brought them out of Egypt."
111Kg 8:22 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven
111Kg 8:23 and said£º "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on earth below--you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way.
111Kg 8:24 You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it--as it is today.
111Kg 8:25 "Now LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, 'You shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons are careful in all they do to walk before me as you have done.'
111Kg 8:26 And now, O God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David my father come true.
111Kg 8:27 "But will God really dwell on earth? The heavens, even the highest heaven, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!
111Kg 8:28 Yet give attention to your servant's prayer and his plea for mercy, O LORD my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence this day.
111Kg 8:29 May your eyes be open toward this temple night and day, this place of which you said, 'My Name shall be there,' so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place.
111Kg 8:30 Hear the supplication of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive.
111Kg 8:31 "When a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple,
111Kg 8:32 then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, condemning the guilty and bringing down on his own head what he has done. Declare the innocent not guilty, and so establish his innocence.
111Kg 8:33 "When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you, and when they turn back to you and confess your name, praying and making supplication to you in this temple,
111Kg 8:34 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to their fathers.
111Kg 8:35 "When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them,
111Kg 8:36 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.
111Kg 8:37 "When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when an enemy besieges them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,
111Kg 8:38 and when a prayer or plea is made by any of your people Israel--each one aware of the afflictions of his own heart, and spreading out his hands toward this temple--
111Kg 8:39 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive and act; deal with each man according to all he does, since you know his heart (for you alone know the hearts of all men),
111Kg 8:40 so that they will fear you all the time they live in the land you gave our fathers.
111Kg 8:41 "As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your name--
111Kg 8:42 for men will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm--when he comes and prays toward this temple,
111Kg 8:43 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.
111Kg 8:44 "When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to the LORD toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name,
111Kg 8:45 then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
111Kg 8:46 "When they sin against you--for there is no one who does not sin--and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to his own land, far away or near;
111Kg 8:47 and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their conquerors and say, 'We have sinned, we have done wrong, we have acted wickedly';
111Kg 8:48 and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive, and pray to you toward the land you gave their fathers, toward the city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name;
111Kg 8:49 then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
111Kg 8:50 And forgive your people, who have sinned against you; forgive all the offenses they have committed against you, and cause their conquerors to show them mercy;
111Kg 8:51 for they are your people and your inheritance, whom you brought out of Egypt, out of that iron-smelting furnace.
111Kg 8:52 "May your eyes be open to your servant's plea and to the plea of your people Israel, and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to you.
111Kg 8:53 For you singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own inheritance, just as you declared through your servant Moses when you, O Sovereign LORD, brought our fathers out of Egypt."
111Kg 8:54 When Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the LORD, he rose from before the altar of the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven.
111Kg 8:55 He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying£º
111Kg 8:56 "Praise be to the LORD, who has given rest to his people Israel just as he promised. Not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave through his servant Moses.
111Kg 8:57 May the LORD our God be with us as he was with our fathers; may he never leave us nor forsake us.
111Kg 8:58 May he turn our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep the commands, decrees and regulations he gave our fathers.
111Kg 8:59 And may these words of mine, which I have prayed before the LORD, be near to the LORD our God day and night, that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel according to each day's need,
111Kg 8:60 so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the LORD is God and that there is no other.
111Kg 8:61 But your hearts must be fully committed to the LORD our God, to live by his decrees and obey his commands, as at this time."
111Kg 8:62 Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the LORD.
111Kg 8:63 Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the LORD£º twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the LORD.
111Kg 8:64 On that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar before the LORD was too small to hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings.
111Kg 8:65 So Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with him--a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it before the LORD our God for seven days and seven days more, fourteen days in all.
111Kg 8:66 On the following day he sent the people away. They blessed the king and then went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the LORD had done for his servant David and his people Israel.
111Kg 9:1 When Solomon had finished building the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do,
111Kg 9:2 the LORD appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon.
111Kg 9:3 The LORD said to him£º "I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
111Kg 9:4 "As for you, if you walk before me in integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws,
111Kg 9:5 I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, 'You shall never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.'
111Kg 9:6 "But if you or your sons turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them,
111Kg 9:7 then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.
111Kg 9:8 And though this temple is now imposing, all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'
111Kg 9:9 People will answer, 'Because they have forsaken the LORD their God, who brought their fathers out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them--that is why the LORD brought all this disaster on them.'"
111Kg 9:10 At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings--the temple of the LORD and the royal palace--
111Kg 9:11 King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and pine and gold he wanted.
111Kg 9:12 But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them.
111Kg 9:13 "What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?" he asked. And he called them the Land of Cabul, a name they have to this day.
111Kg 9:14 Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold.
111Kg 9:15 Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the LORD'S temple, his own palace, the supporting terraces, the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer.
111Kg 9:16 (Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon's wife.
111Kg 9:17 And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon,
111Kg 9:18 Baalath, and Tadmor in the desert, within his land,
111Kg 9:19 as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses--whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.
111Kg 9:20 All the people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites),
111Kg 9:21 that is, their descendants remaining in the land, whom the Israelites could not exterminate--these Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force, as it is to this day.
111Kg 9:22 But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers.
111Kg 9:23 They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon's projects--550 officials supervising the men who did the work.
111Kg 9:24 After Pharaoh's daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the supporting terraces.
111Kg 9:25 Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD, burning incense before the LORD along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations.
111Kg 9:26 King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.
111Kg 9:27 And Hiram sent his men--sailors who knew the sea--to serve in the fleet with Solomon's men.
111Kg 9:28 They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
111Kg 10:1 When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relation to the name of the LORD, she came to test him with hard questions.
111Kg 10:2 Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravan--with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones--she came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind.
111Kg 10:3 Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her.
111Kg 10:4 When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built,
111Kg 10:5 the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the LORD, she was overwhelmed.
111Kg 10:6 She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true.
111Kg 10:7 But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me; in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard.
111Kg 10:8 How happy your men must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
111Kg 10:9 Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD'S eternal love for Israel, he has made you king, to maintain justice and righteousness."
111Kg 10:10 And she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
111Kg 10:11 (Hiram's ships brought gold from Ophir; and from there they brought great cargoes of almugwood and precious stones.
111Kg 10:12 The king used the almugwood to make supports for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. So much almugwood has never been imported or seen since that day.)
111Kg 10:13 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.
111Kg 10:14 The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,
111Kg 10:15 not including the revenues from merchants and traders and from all the Arabian kings and the governors of the land.
111Kg 10:16 King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred bekas of gold went into each shield.
111Kg 10:17 He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three minas of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
111Kg 10:18 Then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with fine gold.
111Kg 10:19 The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them.
111Kg 10:20 Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom.
111Kg 10:21 All King Solomon's goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon's days.
111Kg 10:22 The king had a fleet of trading ships at sea along with the ships of Hiram. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons.
111Kg 10:23 King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.
111Kg 10:24 The whole world sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
111Kg 10:25 Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift--articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules.
111Kg 10:26 Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
111Kg 10:27 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.
111Kg 10:28 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue--the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.
111Kg 10:29 They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.
111Kg 11:1 King Solomon, however, loved many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter--Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians and Hittites.
111Kg 11:2 They were from nations about which the LORD had told the Israelites, "You must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods." Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love.
111Kg 11:3 He had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines, and his wives led him astray.
111Kg 11:4 As Solomon grew old, his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father had been.
111Kg 11:5 He followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.
111Kg 11:6 So Solomon did evil in the eyes of the LORD; he did not follow the LORD completely, as David his father had done.
111Kg 11:7 On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the Ammonites.
111Kg 11:8 He did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods.
111Kg 11:9 The LORD became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.
111Kg 11:10 Although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the LORD'S command.
111Kg 11:11 So the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees, which I commanded you, I will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates.
111Kg 11:12 Nevertheless, for the sake of David your father, I will not do it during your lifetime. I will tear it out of the hand of your son.
111Kg 11:13 Yet I will not tear the whole kingdom from him, but will give him one tribe for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen."
111Kg 11:14 Then the LORD raised up against Solomon an adversary, Hadad the Edomite, from the royal line of Edom.
111Kg 11:15 Earlier when David was fighting with Edom, Joab the commander of the army, who had gone up to bury the dead, had struck down all the men in Edom.
111Kg 11:16 Joab and all the Israelites stayed there for six months, until they had destroyed all the men in Edom.
111Kg 11:17 But Hadad, still only a boy, fled to Egypt with some Edomite officials who had served his father.
111Kg 11:18 They set out from Midian and went to Paran. Then taking men from Paran with them, they went to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave Hadad a house and land and provided him with food.
111Kg 11:19 Pharaoh was so pleased with Hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes, in marriage.
111Kg 11:20 The sister of Tahpenes bore him a son named Genubath, whom Tahpenes brought up in the royal palace. There Genubath lived with Pharaoh's own children.
111Kg 11:21 While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David rested with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was also dead. Then Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me go, that I may return to my own country."
111Kg 11:22 "What have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country?" Pharaoh asked. "Nothing," Hadad replied, "but do let me go!"
111Kg 11:23 And God raised up against Solomon another adversary, Rezon son of Eliada, who had fled from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah.
111Kg 11:24 He gathered men around him and became the leader of a band of rebels when David destroyed the forces of Zobah; the rebels went to Damascus, where they settled and took control.
111Kg 11:25 Rezon was Israel's adversary as long as Solomon lived, adding to the trouble caused by Hadad. So Rezon ruled in Aram and was hostile toward Israel.
111Kg 11:26 Also, Jeroboam son of Nebat rebelled against the king. He was one of Solomon's officials, an Ephraimite from Zeredah, and his mother was a widow named Zeruah.
111Kg 11:27 Here is the account of how he rebelled against the king£º Solomon had built the supporting terraces and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of David his father.
111Kg 11:28 Now Jeroboam was a man of standing, and when Solomon saw how well the young man did his work, he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of Joseph.
111Kg 11:29 About that time Jeroboam was going out of Jerusalem, and Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh met him on the way, wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone out in the country,
111Kg 11:30 and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
111Kg 11:31 Then he said to Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º 'See, I am going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's hand and give you ten tribes.
111Kg 11:32 But for the sake of my servant David and the city of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, he will have one tribe.
111Kg 11:33 I will do this because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Molech the god of the Ammonites, and have not walked in my ways, nor done what is right in my eyes, nor kept my statutes and laws as David, Solomon's father, did.
111Kg 11:34 " 'But I will not take the whole kingdom out of Solomon's hand; I have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David my servant, whom I chose and who observed my commands and statutes.
111Kg 11:35 I will take the kingdom from his son's hands and give you ten tribes.
111Kg 11:36 I will give one tribe to his son so that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to put my Name.
111Kg 11:37 However, as for you, I will take you, and you will rule over all that your heart desires; you will be king over Israel.
111Kg 11:38 If you do whatever I command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and commands, as David my servant did, I will be with you. I will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one I built for David and will give Israel to you.
111Kg 11:39 I will humble David's descendants because of this, but not forever.'"
111Kg 11:40 Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but Jeroboam fled to Egypt, to Shishak the king, and stayed there until Solomon's death.
111Kg 11:41 As for the other events of Solomon's reign--all he did and the wisdom he displayed--are they not written in the book of the annals of Solomon?
111Kg 11:42 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
111Kg 11:43 Then he rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
111Kg 12:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king.
111Kg 12:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.
111Kg 12:3 So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and the whole assembly of Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him£º
111Kg 12:4 "Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."
111Kg 12:5 Rehoboam answered, "Go away for three days and then come back to me." So the people went away.
111Kg 12:6 Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked.
111Kg 12:7 They replied, "If today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants."
111Kg 12:8 But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.
111Kg 12:9 He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"
111Kg 12:10 The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell these people who have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'--tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.
111Kg 12:11 My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'"
111Kg 12:12 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, "Come back to me in three days."
111Kg 12:13 The king answered the people harshly. Rejecting the advice given him by the elders,
111Kg 12:14 he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions."
111Kg 12:15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from the LORD, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
111Kg 12:16 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king£º "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" So the Israelites went home.
111Kg 12:17 But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.
111Kg 12:18 King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but all Israel stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
111Kg 12:19 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
111Kg 12:20 When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the house of David.
111Kg 12:21 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the whole house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin--a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men--to make war against the house of Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam son of Solomon.
111Kg 12:22 But this word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God£º
111Kg 12:23 "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah, to the whole house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,
111Kg 12:24 'This is what the LORD says£º Do not go up to fight against your brothers, the Israelites. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'" So they obeyed the word of the LORD and went home again, as the LORD had ordered.
111Kg 12:25 Then Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. From there he went out and built up Peniel.
111Kg 12:26 Jeroboam thought to himself, "The kingdom will now likely revert to the house of David.
111Kg 12:27 If these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, they will again give their allegiance to their lord, Rehoboam king of Judah. They will kill me and return to King Rehoboam."
111Kg 12:28 After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."
111Kg 12:29 One he set up in Bethel, and the other in Dan.
111Kg 12:30 And this thing became a sin; the people went even as far as Dan to worship the one there.
111Kg 12:31 Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people, even though they were not Levites.
111Kg 12:32 He instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, like the festival held in Judah, and offered sacrifices on the altar. This he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves he had made. And at Bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made.
111Kg 12:33 On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a month of his own choosing, he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at Bethel. So he instituted the festival for the Israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings.
111Kg 13:1 By the word of the LORD a man of God came from Judah to Bethel, as Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make an offering.
111Kg 13:2 He cried out against the altar by the word of the LORD£º "O altar, altar! This is what the LORD says£º 'A son named Josiah will be born to the house of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who now make offerings here, and human bones will be burned on you.'"
111Kg 13:3 That same day the man of God gave a sign£º "This is the sign the LORD has declared£º The altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out."
111Kg 13:4 When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God cried out against the altar at Bethel, he stretched out his hand from the altar and said, "Seize him!" But the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up, so that he could not pull it back.
111Kg 13:5 Also, the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of God by the word of the LORD.
111Kg 13:6 Then the king said to the man of God, "Intercede with the LORD your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored." So the man of God interceded with the LORD, and the king's hand was restored and became as it was before.
111Kg 13:7 The king said to the man of God, "Come home with me and have something to eat, and I will give you a gift."
111Kg 13:8 But the man of God answered the king, "Even if you were to give me half your possessions, I would not go with you, nor would I eat bread or drink water here.
111Kg 13:9 For I was commanded by the word of the LORD£º 'You must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came.'"
111Kg 13:10 So he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to Bethel.
111Kg 13:11 Now there was a certain old prophet living in Bethel, whose sons came and told him all that the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to the king.
111Kg 13:12 Their father asked them, "Which way did he go?" And his sons showed him which road the man of God from Judah had taken.
111Kg 13:13 So he said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." And when they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it
111Kg 13:14 and rode after the man of God. He found him sitting under an oak tree and asked, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" "I am," he replied.
111Kg 13:15 So the prophet said to him, "Come home with me and eat."
111Kg 13:16 The man of God said, "I cannot turn back and go with you, nor can I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.
111Kg 13:17 I have been told by the word of the LORD£º 'You must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came.'"
111Kg 13:18 The old prophet answered, "I too am a prophet, as you are. And an angel said to me by the word of the LORD£º 'Bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water.'" (But he was lying to him.)
111Kg 13:19 So the man of God returned with him and ate and drank in his house.
111Kg 13:20 While they were sitting at the table, the word of the LORD came to the old prophet who had brought him back.
111Kg 13:21 He cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, "This is what the LORD says£º 'You have defied the word of the LORD and have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you.
111Kg 13:22 You came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink. Therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your fathers.'"
111Kg 13:23 When the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him.
111Kg 13:24 As he went on his way, a lion met him on the road and killed him, and his body was thrown down on the road, with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it.
111Kg 13:25 Some people who passed by saw the body thrown down there, with the lion standing beside the body, and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived.
111Kg 13:26 When the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it, he said, "It is the man of God who defied the word of the LORD. The LORD has given him over to the lion, which has mauled him and killed him, as the word of the LORD had warned him."
111Kg 13:27 The prophet said to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me," and they did so.
111Kg 13:28 Then he went out and found the body thrown down on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it. The lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey.
111Kg 13:29 So the prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him.
111Kg 13:30 Then he laid the body in his own tomb, and they mourned over him and said, "Oh, my brother!"
111Kg 13:31 After burying him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
111Kg 13:32 For the message he declared by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true."
111Kg 13:33 Even after this, Jeroboam did not change his evil ways, but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people. Anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places.
111Kg 13:34 This was the sin of the house of Jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth.
111Kg 14:1 At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill,
111Kg 14:2 and Jeroboam said to his wife, "Go, disguise yourself, so you won't be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there--the one who told me I would be king over this people.
111Kg 14:3 Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy."
111Kg 14:4 So Jeroboam's wife did what he said and went to Ahijah's house in Shiloh. Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age.
111Kg 14:5 But the LORD had told Ahijah, "Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else."
111Kg 14:6 So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news.
111Kg 14:7 Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º 'I raised you up from among the people and made you a leader over my people Israel.
111Kg 14:8 I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes.
111Kg 14:9 You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods, idols made of metal; you have provoked me to anger and thrust me behind your back.
111Kg 14:10 " 'Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israel--slave or free. I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns dung, until it is all gone.
111Kg 14:11 Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country. The LORD has spoken!'
111Kg 14:12 "As for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will die.
111Kg 14:13 All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the LORD, the God of Israel, has found anything good.
111Kg 14:14 "The LORD will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Yes, even now.
111Kg 14:15 And the LORD will strike Israel, so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their forefathers and scatter them beyond the River, because they provoked the LORD to anger by making Asherah poles.
111Kg 14:16 And he will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit."
111Kg 14:17 Then Jeroboam's wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died.
111Kg 14:18 They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the LORD had said through his servant the prophet Ahijah.
111Kg 14:19 The other events of Jeroboam's reign, his wars and how he ruled, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
111Kg 14:20 He reigned for twenty-two years and then rested with his fathers. And Nadab his son succeeded him as king.
111Kg 14:21 Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.
111Kg 14:22 Judah did evil in the eyes of the LORD. By the sins they committed they stirred up his jealous anger more than their fathers had done.
111Kg 14:23 They also set up for themselves high places, sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.
111Kg 14:24 There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
111Kg 14:25 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem.
111Kg 14:26 He carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including all the gold shields Solomon had made.
111Kg 14:27 So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
111Kg 14:28 Whenever the king went to the LORD'S temple, the guards bore the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.
111Kg 14:29 As for the other events of Rehoboam's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
111Kg 14:30 There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
111Kg 14:31 And Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
111Kg 15:1 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijah became king of Judah,
111Kg 15:2 and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother's name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
111Kg 15:3 He committed all the sins his father had done before him; his heart was not fully devoted to the LORD his God, as the heart of David his forefather had been.
111Kg 15:4 Nevertheless, for David's sake the LORD his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and by making Jerusalem strong.
111Kg 15:5 For David had done what was right in the eyes of the LORD and had not failed to keep any of the LORD'S commands all the days of his life--except in the case of Uriah the Hittite.
111Kg 15:6 There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout Abijah's lifetime.
111Kg 15:7 As for the other events of Abijah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
111Kg 15:8 And Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And Asa his son succeeded him as king.
111Kg 15:9 In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king of Judah,
111Kg 15:10 and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother's name was Maacah daughter of Abishalom.
111Kg 15:11 Asa did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, as his father David had done.
111Kg 15:12 He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made.
111Kg 15:13 He even deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut the pole down and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
111Kg 15:14 Although he did not remove the high places, Asa's heart was fully committed to the LORD all his life.
111Kg 15:15 He brought into the temple of the LORD the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.
111Kg 15:16 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
111Kg 15:17 Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
111Kg 15:18 Asa then took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the LORD'S temple and of his own palace. He entrusted it to his officials and sent them to Ben-Hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus.
111Kg 15:19 "Let there be a treaty between me and you," he said, "as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me."
111Kg 15:20 Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maacah and all Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali.
111Kg 15:21 When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.
111Kg 15:22 Then King Asa issued an order to all Judah--no one was exempt--and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using there. With them King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin, and also Mizpah.
111Kg 15:23 As for all the other events of Asa's reign, all his achievements, all he did and the cities he built, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? In his old age, however, his feet became diseased.
111Kg 15:24 Then Asa rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his father David. And Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king.
111Kg 15:25 Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
111Kg 15:26 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, walking in the ways of his father and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit.
111Kg 15:27 Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar plotted against him, and he struck him down at Gibbethon, a Philistine town, while Nadab and all Israel were besieging it.
111Kg 15:28 Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of Asa king of Judah and succeeded him as king.
111Kg 15:29 As soon as he began to reign, he killed Jeroboam's whole family. He did not leave Jeroboam anyone that breathed, but destroyed them all, according to the word of the LORD given through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite--
111Kg 15:30 because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger.
111Kg 15:31 As for the other events of Nadab's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
111Kg 15:32 There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns.
111Kg 15:33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah became king of all Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years.
111Kg 15:34 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, walking in the ways of Jeroboam and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit.
111Kg 16:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu son of Hanani against Baasha£º
111Kg 16:2 "I lifted you up from the dust and made you leader of my people Israel, but you walked in the ways of Jeroboam and caused my people Israel to sin and to provoke me to anger by their sins.
111Kg 16:3 So I am about to consume Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
111Kg 16:4 Dogs will eat those belonging to Baasha who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country."
111Kg 16:5 As for the other events of Baasha's reign, what he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
111Kg 16:6 Baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah. And Elah his son succeeded him as king.
111Kg 16:7 Moreover, the word of the LORD came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani to Baasha and his house, because of all the evil he had done in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger by the things he did, and becoming like the house of Jeroboam--and also because he destroyed it.
111Kg 16:8 In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel, and he reigned in Tirzah two years.
111Kg 16:9 Zimri, one of his officials, who had command of half his chariots, plotted against him. Elah was in Tirzah at the time, getting drunk in the home of Arza, the man in charge of the palace at Tirzah.
111Kg 16:10 Zimri came in, struck him down and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah. Then he succeeded him as king.
111Kg 16:11 As soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne, he killed off Baasha's whole family. He did not spare a single male, whether relative or friend.
111Kg 16:12 So Zimri destroyed the whole family of Baasha, in accordance with the word of the LORD spoken against Baasha through the prophet Jehu--
111Kg 16:13 because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed and had caused Israel to commit, so that they provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their worthless idols.
111Kg 16:14 As for the other events of Elah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
111Kg 16:15 In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned in Tirzah seven days. The army was encamped near Gibbethon, a Philistine town.
111Kg 16:16 When the Israelites in the camp heard that Zimri had plotted against the king and murdered him, they proclaimed Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that very day there in the camp.
111Kg 16:17 Then Omri and all the Israelites with him withdrew from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah.
111Kg 16:18 When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the royal palace and set the palace on fire around him. So he died,
111Kg 16:19 because of the sins he had committed, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD and walking in the ways of Jeroboam and in the sin he had committed and had caused Israel to commit.
111Kg 16:20 As for the other events of Zimri's reign, and the rebellion he carried out, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
111Kg 16:21 Then the people of Israel were split into two factions; half supported Tibni son of Ginath for king, and the other half supported Omri.
111Kg 16:22 But Omri's followers proved stronger than those of Tibni son of Ginath. So Tibni died and Omri became king.
111Kg 16:23 In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned twelve years, six of them in Tirzah.
111Kg 16:24 He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver and built a city on the hill, calling it Samaria, after Shemer, the name of the former owner of the hill.
111Kg 16:25 But Omri did evil in the eyes of the LORD and sinned more than all those before him.
111Kg 16:26 He walked in all the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat and in his sin, which he had caused Israel to commit, so that they provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their worthless idols.
111Kg 16:27 As for the other events of Omri's reign, what he did and the things he achieved, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
111Kg 16:28 Omri rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And Ahab his son succeeded him as king.
111Kg 16:29 In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria over Israel twenty-two years.
111Kg 16:30 Ahab son of Omri did more evil in the eyes of the LORD than any of those before him.
111Kg 16:31 He not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, but he also married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and began to serve Baal and worship him.
111Kg 16:32 He set up an altar for Baal in the temple of Baal that he built in Samaria.
111Kg 16:33 Ahab also made an Asherah pole and did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than did all the kings of Israel before him.
111Kg 16:34 In Ahab's time, Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son Abiram, and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, in accordance with the word of the LORD spoken by Joshua son of Nun.
111Kg 17:1 Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, "As the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word."
111Kg 17:2 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah£º
111Kg 17:3 "Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan.
111Kg 17:4 You will drink from the brook, and I have ordered the ravens to feed you there."
111Kg 17:5 So he did what the LORD had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there.
111Kg 17:6 The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook.
111Kg 17:7 Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
111Kg 17:8 Then the word of the LORD came to him£º
111Kg 17:9 "Go at once to Zarephath of Sidon and stay there. I have commanded a widow in that place to supply you with food."
111Kg 17:10 So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, "Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?"
111Kg 17:11 As she was going to get it, he called, "And bring me, please, a piece of bread."
111Kg 17:12 "As surely as the LORD your God lives," she replied, "I don't have any bread--only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it--and die."
111Kg 17:13 Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son.
111Kg 17:14 For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º 'The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the LORD gives rain on the land.'"
111Kg 17:15 She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family.
111Kg 17:16 For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the LORD spoken by Elijah.
111Kg 17:17 Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing.
111Kg 17:18 She said to Elijah, "What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?"
111Kg 17:19 "Give me your son," Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed.
111Kg 17:20 Then he cried out to the LORD, "O LORD my God, have you brought tragedy also upon this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?"
111Kg 17:21 Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried to the LORD, "O LORD my God, let this boy's life return to him!"
111Kg 17:22 The LORD heard Elijah's cry, and the boy's life returned to him, and he lived.
111Kg 17:23 Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, "Look, your son is alive!"
111Kg 17:24 Then the woman said to Elijah, "Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the LORD from your mouth is the truth."
111Kg 18:1 After a long time, in the third year, the word of the LORD came to Elijah£º "Go and present yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the land."
111Kg 18:2 So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria,
111Kg 18:3 and Ahab had summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of his palace. (Obadiah was a devout believer in the LORD.
111Kg 18:4 While Jezebel was killing off the LORD'S prophets, Obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves, fifty in each, and had supplied them with food and water.)
111Kg 18:5 Ahab had said to Obadiah, "Go through the land to all the springs and valleys. Maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals."
111Kg 18:6 So they divided the land they were to cover, Ahab going in one direction and Obadiah in another.
111Kg 18:7 As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, "Is it really you, my lord Elijah?"
111Kg 18:8 "Yes," he replied. "Go tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'"
111Kg 18:9 "What have I done wrong," asked Obadiah, "that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to be put to death?
111Kg 18:10 As surely as the LORD your God lives, there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you. And whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there, he made them swear they could not find you.
111Kg 18:11 But now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.'
111Kg 18:12 I don't know where the Spirit of the LORD may carry you when I leave you. If I go and tell Ahab and he doesn't find you, he will kill me. Yet I your servant have worshiped the LORD since my youth.
111Kg 18:13 Haven't you heard, my lord, what I did while Jezebel was killing the prophets of the LORD? I hid a hundred of the LORD'S prophets in two caves, fifty in each, and supplied them with food and water.
111Kg 18:14 And now you tell me to go to my master and say, 'Elijah is here.' He will kill me!"
111Kg 18:15 Elijah said, "As the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I will surely present myself to Ahab today."
111Kg 18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
111Kg 18:17 When he saw Elijah, he said to him, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?"
111Kg 18:18 "I have not made trouble for Israel," Elijah replied. "But you and your father's family have. You have abandoned the LORD'S commands and have followed the Baals.
111Kg 18:19 Now summon the people from all over Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. And bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel's table."
111Kg 18:20 So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
111Kg 18:21 Elijah went before the people and said, "How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him." But the people said nothing.
111Kg 18:22 Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only one of the LORD'S prophets left, but Baal has four hundred and fifty prophets.
111Kg 18:23 Get two bulls for us. Let them choose one for themselves, and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it.
111Kg 18:24 Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by fire--he is God." Then all the people said, "What you say is good."
111Kg 18:25 Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but do not light the fire."
111Kg 18:26 So they took the bull given them and prepared it. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning till noon. "O Baal, answer us!" they shouted. But there was no response; no one answered. And they danced around the altar they had made.
111Kg 18:27 At noon Elijah began to taunt them. "Shout louder!" he said. "Surely he is a god! Perhaps he is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling. Maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened."
111Kg 18:28 So they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears, as was their custom, until their blood flowed.
111Kg 18:29 Midday passed, and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice. But there was no response, no one answered, no one paid attention.
111Kg 18:30 Then Elijah said to all the people, "Come here to me." They came to him, and he repaired the altar of the LORD, which was in ruins.
111Kg 18:31 Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes descended from Jacob, to whom the word of the LORD had come, saying, "Your name shall be Israel."
111Kg 18:32 With the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD, and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed.
111Kg 18:33 He arranged the wood, cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood. Then he said to them, "Fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood."
111Kg 18:34 "Do it again," he said, and they did it again. "Do it a third time," he ordered, and they did it the third time.
111Kg 18:35 The water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench.
111Kg 18:36 At the time of sacrifice, the prophet Elijah stepped forward and prayed£º "O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.
111Kg 18:37 Answer me, O LORD, answer me, so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God, and that you are turning their hearts back again."
111Kg 18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones and the soil, and also licked up the water in the trench.
111Kg 18:39 When all the people saw this, they fell prostrate and cried, "The LORD--he is God! The LORD--he is God!"
111Kg 18:40 Then Elijah commanded them, "Seize the prophets of Baal. Don't let anyone get away!" They seized them, and Elijah had them brought down to the Kishon Valley and slaughtered there.
111Kg 18:41 And Elijah said to Ahab, "Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain."
111Kg 18:42 So Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees.
111Kg 18:43 "Go and look toward the sea," he told his servant. And he went up and looked. "There is nothing there," he said. Seven times Elijah said, "Go back."
111Kg 18:44 The seventh time the servant reported, "A cloud as small as a man's hand is rising from the sea." So Elijah said, "Go and tell Ahab, 'Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.'"
111Kg 18:45 Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel.
111Kg 18:46 The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel.
111Kg 19:1 Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.
111Kg 19:2 So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them."
111Kg 19:3 Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there,
111Kg 19:4 while he himself went a day's journey into the desert. He came to a broom tree, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. "I have had enough, LORD," he said. "Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors."
111Kg 19:5 Then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep. All at once an angel touched him and said, "Get up and eat."
111Kg 19:6 He looked around, and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.
111Kg 19:7 The angel of the LORD came back a second time and touched him and said, "Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you."
111Kg 19:8 So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God.
111Kg 19:9 There he went into a cave and spent the night. And the word of the LORD came to him£º "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
111Kg 19:10 He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too."
111Kg 19:11 The LORD said, "Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the LORD, for the LORD is about to pass by." Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the LORD, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
111Kg 19:12 After the earthquake came a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper.
111Kg 19:13 When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. Then a voice said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
111Kg 19:14 He replied, "I have been very zealous for the LORD God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, broken down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too."
111Kg 19:15 The LORD said to him, "Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram.
111Kg 19:16 Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet.
111Kg 19:17 Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu.
111Kg 19:18 Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel--all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him."
111Kg 19:19 So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him.
111Kg 19:20 Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. "Let me kiss my father and mother good-by," he said, "and then I will come with you." "Go back," Elijah replied. "What have I done to you?"
111Kg 19:21 So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his attendant.
111Kg 20:1 Now Ben-Hadad king of Aram mustered his entire army. Accompanied by thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots, he went up and besieged Samaria and attacked it.
111Kg 20:2 He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying, "This is what Ben-Hadad says£º
111Kg 20:3 'Your silver and gold are mine, and the best of your wives and children are mine.'"
111Kg 20:4 The king of Israel answered, "Just as you say, my lord the king. I and all I have are yours."
111Kg 20:5 The messengers came again and said, "This is what Ben-Hadad says£º 'I sent to demand your silver and gold, your wives and your children.
111Kg 20:6 But about this time tomorrow I am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials. They will seize everything you value and carry it away.'"
111Kg 20:7 The king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, "See how this man is looking for trouble! When he sent for my wives and my children, my silver and my gold, I did not refuse him."
111Kg 20:8 The elders and the people all answered, "Don't listen to him or agree to his demands."
111Kg 20:9 So he replied to Ben-Hadad's messengers, "Tell my lord the king, 'Your servant will do all you demanded the first time, but this demand I cannot meet.'" They left and took the answer back to Ben-Hadad.
111Kg 20:10 Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab£º "May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if enough dust remains in Samaria to give each of my men a handful."
111Kg 20:11 The king of Israel answered, "Tell him£º 'One who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off.'"
111Kg 20:12 Ben-Hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents, and he ordered his men£º "Prepare to attack." So they prepared to attack the city.
111Kg 20:13 Meanwhile a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and announced, "This is what the LORD says£º 'Do you see this vast army? I will give it into your hand today, and then you will know that I am the LORD.'"
111Kg 20:14 "But who will do this?" asked Ahab. The prophet replied, "This is what the LORD says£º 'The young officers of the provincial commanders will do it.'" "And who will start the battle?" he asked. The prophet answered, "You will."
111Kg 20:15 So Ahab summoned the young officers of the provincial commanders, 232 men. Then he assembled the rest of the Israelites, 7,000 in all.
111Kg 20:16 They set out at noon while Ben-Hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk.
111Kg 20:17 The young officers of the provincial commanders went out first. Now Ben-Hadad had dispatched scouts, who reported, "Men are advancing from Samaria."
111Kg 20:18 He said, "If they have come out for peace, take them alive; if they have come out for war, take them alive."
111Kg 20:19 The young officers of the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them
111Kg 20:20 and each one struck down his opponent. At that, the Arameans fled, with the Israelites in pursuit. But Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen.
111Kg 20:21 The king of Israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the Arameans.
111Kg 20:22 Afterward, the prophet came to the king of Israel and said, "Strengthen your position and see what must be done, because next spring the king of Aram will attack you again."
111Kg 20:23 Meanwhile, the officials of the king of Aram advised him, "Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains, surely we will be stronger than they.
111Kg 20:24 Do this£º Remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers.
111Kg 20:25 You must also raise an army like the one you lost--horse for horse and chariot for chariot--so we can fight Israel on the plains. Then surely we will be stronger than they." He agreed with them and acted accordingly.
111Kg 20:26 The next spring Ben-Hadad mustered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
111Kg 20:27 When the Israelites were also mustered and given provisions, they marched out to meet them. The Israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans covered the countryside.
111Kg 20:28 The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, "This is what the LORD says£º 'Because the Arameans think the LORD is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the LORD.'"
111Kg 20:29 For seven days they camped opposite each other, and on the seventh day the battle was joined. The Israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the Aramean foot soldiers in one day.
111Kg 20:30 The rest of them escaped to the city of Aphek, where the wall collapsed on twenty-seven thousand of them. And Ben-Hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room.
111Kg 20:31 His officials said to him, "Look, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful. Let us go to the king of Israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads. Perhaps he will spare your life."
111Kg 20:32 Wearing sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, they went to the king of Israel and said, "Your servant Ben-Hadad says£º 'Please let me live.'" The king answered, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."
111Kg 20:33 The men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word. "Yes, your brother Ben-Hadad!" they said. "Go and get him," the king said. When Ben-Hadad came out, Ahab had him come up into his chariot.
111Kg 20:34 "I will return the cities my father took from your father," Ben-Hadad offered. "You may set up your own market areas in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." Ahab said,"On the basis of a treaty I will set you free." So he made a treaty with him, and let him go.
111Kg 20:35 By the word of the LORD one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion, "Strike me with your weapon," but the man refused.
111Kg 20:36 So the prophet said, "Because you have not obeyed the LORD, as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you." And after the man went away, a lion found him and killed him.
111Kg 20:37 The prophet found another man and said, "Strike me, please." So the man struck him and wounded him.
111Kg 20:38 Then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king. He disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes.
111Kg 20:39 As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, "Your servant went into the thick of the battle, and someone came to me with a captive and said, 'Guard this man. If he is missing, it will be your life for his life, or you must pay a talent of silver.'
111Kg 20:40 While your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared." "That is your sentence," the king of Israel said. "You have pronounced it yourself."
111Kg 20:41 Then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
111Kg 20:42 He said to the king, "This is what the LORD says£º 'You have set free a man I had determined should die. Therefore it is your life for his life, your people for his people.'"
111Kg 20:43 Sullen and angry, the king of Israel went to his palace in Samaria.
111Kg 21:1 Some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite. The vineyard was in Jezreel, close to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.
111Kg 21:2 Ahab said to Naboth, "Let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden, since it is close to my palace. In exchange I will give you a better vineyard or, if you prefer, I will pay you whatever it is worth."
111Kg 21:3 But Naboth replied, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers."
111Kg 21:4 So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, "I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers." He lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat.
111Kg 21:5 His wife Jezebel came in and asked him, "Why are you so sullen? Why won't you eat?"
111Kg 21:6 He answered her, "Because I said to Naboth the Jezreelite, 'Sell me your vineyard; or if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard in its place.' But he said, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'"
111Kg 21:7 Jezebel his wife said, "Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat! Cheer up. I'll get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."
111Kg 21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, placed his seal on them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city with him.
111Kg 21:9 In those letters she wrote£º "Proclaim a day of fasting and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people.
111Kg 21:10 But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death."
111Kg 21:11 So the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth's city did as Jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them.
111Kg 21:12 They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth in a prominent place among the people.
111Kg 21:13 Then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against Naboth before the people, saying, "Naboth has cursed both God and the king." So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.
111Kg 21:14 Then they sent word to Jezebel£º "Naboth has been stoned and is dead."
111Kg 21:15 As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, "Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead."
111Kg 21:16 When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of Naboth's vineyard.
111Kg 21:17 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite£º
111Kg 21:18 "Go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He is now in Naboth's vineyard, where he has gone to take possession of it.
111Kg 21:19 Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says£º Have you not murdered a man and seized his property?' Then say to him, 'This is what the LORD says£º In the place where dogs licked up Naboth's blood, dogs will lick up your blood--yes, yours!'"
111Kg 21:20 Ahab said to Elijah, "So you have found me, my enemy!" "I have found you," he answered, "because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD.
111Kg 21:21 'I am going to bring disaster on you. I will consume your descendants and cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel--slave or free.
111Kg 21:22 I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked me to anger and have caused Israel to sin.'
111Kg 21:23 "And also concerning Jezebel the LORD says£º 'Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.'
111Kg 21:24 "Dogs will eat those belonging to Ahab who die in the city, and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country."
111Kg 21:25 (There was never a man like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, urged on by Jezebel his wife.
111Kg 21:26 He behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols, like the Amorites the LORD drove out before Israel.)
111Kg 21:27 When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted. He lay in sackcloth and went around meekly.
111Kg 21:28 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite£º
111Kg 21:29 "Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring this disaster in his day, but I will bring it on his house in the days of his son."
111Kg 22:1 For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.
111Kg 22:2 But in the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel.
111Kg 22:3 The king of Israel had said to his officials, "Don't you know that Ramoth Gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of Aram?"
111Kg 22:4 So he asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you go with me to fight against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
111Kg 22:5 But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD."
111Kg 22:6 So the king of Israel brought together the prophets--about four hundred men--and asked them, "Shall I go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for the Lord will give it into the king's hand."
111Kg 22:7 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?"
111Kg 22:8 The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king should not say that," Jehoshaphat replied.
111Kg 22:9 So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once."
111Kg 22:10 Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
111Kg 22:11 Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared, "This is what the LORD says£º 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'"
111Kg 22:12 All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."
111Kg 22:13 The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably."
111Kg 22:14 But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what the LORD tells me."
111Kg 22:15 When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."
111Kg 22:16 The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
111Kg 22:17 Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"
111Kg 22:18 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"
111Kg 22:19 Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD£º I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left.
111Kg 22:20 And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' "One suggested this, and another that.
111Kg 22:21 Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.'
111Kg 22:22 " 'By what means?' the LORD asked. " 'I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. " 'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. 'Go and do it.'
111Kg 22:23 "So now the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you."
111Kg 22:24 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.
111Kg 22:25 Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."
111Kg 22:26 The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son
111Kg 22:27 and say, 'This is what the king says£º Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'"
111Kg 22:28 Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"
111Kg 22:29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
111Kg 22:30 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
111Kg 22:31 Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."
111Kg 22:32 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "Surely this is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but when Jehoshaphat cried out,
111Kg 22:33 the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel and stopped pursuing him.
111Kg 22:34 But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told his chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."
111Kg 22:35 All day long the battle raged, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.
111Kg 22:36 As the sun was setting, a cry spread through the army£º "Every man to his town; everyone to his land!"
111Kg 22:37 So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there.
111Kg 22:38 They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria (where the prostitutes bathed), and the dogs licked up his blood, as the word of the LORD had declared.
111Kg 22:39 As for the other events of Ahab's reign, including all he did, the palace he built and inlaid with ivory, and the cities he fortified, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
111Kg 22:40 Ahab rested with his fathers. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
111Kg 22:41 Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
111Kg 22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
111Kg 22:43 In everything he walked in the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD. The high places, however, were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
111Kg 22:44 Jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of Israel.
111Kg 22:45 As for the other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, the things he achieved and his military exploits, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
111Kg 22:46 He rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa.
111Kg 22:47 There was then no king in Edom; a deputy ruled.
111Kg 22:48 Now Jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships to go to Ophir for gold, but they never set sail--they were wrecked at Ezion Geber.
111Kg 22:49 At that time Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, "Let my men sail with your men," but Jehoshaphat refused.
111Kg 22:50 Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son succeeded him.
111Kg 22:51 Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years.
111Kg 22:52 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, because he walked in the ways of his father and mother and in the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.
111Kg 22:53 He served and worshiped Baal and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger, just as his father had done.
12
122Kg 1:1 After Ahab's death, Moab rebelled against Israel.
122Kg 1:2 Now Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself. So he sent messengers, saying to them, "Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury."
122Kg 1:3 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, "Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?'
122Kg 1:4 Therefore this is what the LORD says£º 'You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!'" So Elijah went.
122Kg 1:5 When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, "Why have you come back?"
122Kg 1:6 "A man came to meet us," they replied. "And he said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and tell him, "This is what the LORD says£º Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!" '"
122Kg 1:7 The king asked them, "What kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this?"
122Kg 1:8 They replied, "He was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist." The king said, "That was Elijah the Tishbite."
122Kg 1:9 Then he sent to Elijah a captain with his company of fifty men. The captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "Man of God, the king says, 'Come down!'"
122Kg 1:10 Elijah answered the captain, "If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.
122Kg 1:11 At this the king sent to Elijah another captain with his fifty men. The captain said to him, "Man of God, this is what the king says, 'Come down at once!'"
122Kg 1:12 "If I am a man of God," Elijah replied, "may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men!" Then the fire of God fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.
122Kg 1:13 So the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. This third captain went up and fell on his knees before Elijah. "Man of God," he begged, "please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men, your servants!
122Kg 1:14 See, fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men. But now have respect for my life!"
122Kg 1:15 The angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king.
122Kg 1:16 He told the king, "This is what the LORD says£º Is it because there is no God in Israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron? Because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die!"
122Kg 1:17 So he died, according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Because Ahaziah had no son, Joram succeeded him as king in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah.
122Kg 1:18 As for all the other events of Ahaziah's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
122Kg 2:1 When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal.
122Kg 2:2 Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to Bethel." But Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.
122Kg 2:3 The company of the prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," Elisha replied, "but do not speak of it."
122Kg 2:4 Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here, Elisha; the LORD has sent me to Jericho." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So they went to Jericho.
122Kg 2:5 The company of the prophets at Jericho went up to Elisha and asked him, "Do you know that the LORD is going to take your master from you today?" "Yes, I know," he replied, "but do not speak of it."
122Kg 2:6 Then Elijah said to him, "Stay here; the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." And he replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So the two of them walked on.
122Kg 2:7 Fifty men of the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, facing the place where Elijah and Elisha had stopped at the Jordan.
122Kg 2:8 Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided to the right and to the left, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
122Kg 2:9 When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me, what can I do for you before I am taken from you?" "Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit," Elisha replied.
122Kg 2:10 "You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah said, "yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours--otherwise not."
122Kg 2:11 As they were walking along and talking together, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them, and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.
122Kg 2:12 Elisha saw this and cried out, "My father! My father! The chariots and horsemen of Israel!" And Elisha saw him no more. Then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them apart.
122Kg 2:13 He picked up the cloak that had fallen from Elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.
122Kg 2:14 Then he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it. "Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" he asked. When he struck the water, it divided to the right and to the left, and he crossed over.
122Kg 2:15 The company of the prophets from Jericho, who were watching, said, "The spirit of Elijah is resting on Elisha." And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
122Kg 2:16 "Look," they said, "we your servants have fifty able men. Let them go and look for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valley." "No," Elisha replied, "do not send them."
122Kg 2:17 But they persisted until he was too ashamed to refuse. So he said, "Send them." And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.
122Kg 2:18 When they returned to Elisha, who was staying in Jericho, he said to them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?"
122Kg 2:19 The men of the city said to Elisha, "Look, our lord, this town is well situated, as you can see, but the water is bad and the land is unproductive."
122Kg 2:20 "Bring me a new bowl," he said, "and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.
122Kg 2:21 Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying, "This is what the LORD says£º 'I have healed this water. Never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive.'"
122Kg 2:22 And the water has remained wholesome to this day, according to the word Elisha had spoken.
122Kg 2:23 From there Elisha went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, some youths came out of the town and jeered at him. "Go on up, you baldhead!" they said. "Go on up, you baldhead!"
122Kg 2:24 He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the youths.
122Kg 2:25 And he went on to Mount Carmel and from there returned to Samaria.
122Kg 3:1 Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned twelve years.
122Kg 3:2 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father and mother had done. He got rid of the sacred stone of Baal that his father had made.
122Kg 3:3 Nevertheless he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he did not turn away from them.
122Kg 3:4 Now Mesha king of Moab raised sheep, and he had to supply the king of Israel with a hundred thousand lambs and with the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
122Kg 3:5 But after Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
122Kg 3:6 So at that time King Joram set out from Samaria and mobilized all Israel.
122Kg 3:7 He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah£º "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?" "I will go with you," he replied. "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."
122Kg 3:8 "By what route shall we attack?" he asked. "Through the Desert of Edom," he answered.
122Kg 3:9 So the king of Israel set out with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After a roundabout march of seven days, the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them.
122Kg 3:10 "What!" exclaimed the king of Israel. "Has the LORD called us three kings together only to hand us over to Moab?"
122Kg 3:11 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here, that we may inquire of the LORD through him?" An officer of the king of Israel answered, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah."
122Kg 3:12 Jehoshaphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.
122Kg 3:13 Elisha said to the king of Israel, "What do we have to do with each other? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother." "No," the king of Israel answered, "because it was the LORD who called us three kings together to hand us over to Moab."
122Kg 3:14 Elisha said, "As surely as the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, if I did not have respect for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would not look at you or even notice you.
122Kg 3:15 But now bring me a harpist." While the harpist was playing, the hand of the LORD came upon Elisha
122Kg 3:16 and he said, "This is what the LORD says£º Make this valley full of ditches.
122Kg 3:17 For this is what the LORD says£º You will see neither wind nor rain, yet this valley will be filled with water, and you, your cattle and your other animals will drink.
122Kg 3:18 This is an easy thing in the eyes of the LORD; he will also hand Moab over to you.
122Kg 3:19 You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town. You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones."
122Kg 3:20 The next morning, about the time for offering the sacrifice, there it was--water flowing from the direction of Edom! And the land was filled with water.
122Kg 3:21 Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them; so every man, young and old, who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border.
122Kg 3:22 When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. To the Moabites across the way, the water looked red--like blood.
122Kg 3:23 "That's blood!" they said. "Those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other. Now to the plunder, Moab!"
122Kg 3:24 But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and fought them until they fled. And the Israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the Moabites.
122Kg 3:25 They destroyed the towns, and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered. They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree. Only Kir Hareseth was left with its stones in place, but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well.
122Kg 3:26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle had gone against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they failed.
122Kg 3:27 Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall. The fury against Israel was great; they withdrew and returned to their own land.
122Kg 4:1 The wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, "Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that he revered the LORD. But now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves."
122Kg 4:2 Elisha replied to her, "How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?" "Your servant has nothing there at all," she said, "except a little oil."
122Kg 4:3 Elisha said, "Go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars. Don't ask for just a few.
122Kg 4:4 Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side."
122Kg 4:5 She left him and afterward shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and she kept pouring.
122Kg 4:6 When all the jars were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another one." But he replied, "There is not a jar left." Then the oil stopped flowing.
122Kg 4:7 She went and told the man of God, and he said, "Go, sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your sons can live on what is left."
122Kg 4:8 One day Elisha went to Shunem. And a well-to-do woman was there, who urged him to stay for a meal. So whenever he came by, he stopped there to eat.
122Kg 4:9 She said to her husband, "I know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of God.
122Kg 4:10 Let's make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table, a chair and a lamp for him. Then he can stay there whenever he comes to us."
122Kg 4:11 One day when Elisha came, he went up to his room and lay down there.
122Kg 4:12 He said to his servant Gehazi, "Call the Shunammite." So he called her, and she stood before him.
122Kg 4:13 Elisha said to him, "Tell her, 'You have gone to all this trouble for us. Now what can be done for you? Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?'" She replied, "I have a home among my own people."
122Kg 4:14 "What can be done for her?" Elisha asked. Gehazi said, "Well, she has no son and her husband is old."
122Kg 4:15 Then Elisha said, "Call her." So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.
122Kg 4:16 "About this time next year," Elisha said, "you will hold a son in your arms." "No, my lord," she objected. "Don't mislead your servant, O man of God!"
122Kg 4:17 But the woman became pregnant, and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son, just as Elisha had told her.
122Kg 4:18 The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.
122Kg 4:19 "My head! My head!" he said to his father. His father told a servant, "Carry him to his mother."
122Kg 4:20 After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.
122Kg 4:21 She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out.
122Kg 4:22 She called her husband and said, "Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return."
122Kg 4:23 "Why go to him today?" he asked. "It's not the New Moon or the Sabbath." "It's all right," she said.
122Kg 4:24 She saddled the donkey and said to her servant, "Lead on; don't slow down for me unless I tell you."
122Kg 4:25 So she set out and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When he saw her in the distance, the man of God said to his servant Gehazi, "Look! There's the Shunammite!
122Kg 4:26 Run to meet her and ask her, 'Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?'" "Everything is all right," she said.
122Kg 4:27 When she reached the man of God at the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, but the man of God said, "Leave her alone! She is in bitter distress, but the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me why."
122Kg 4:28 "Did I ask you for a son, my lord?" she said. "Didn't I tell you, 'Don't raise my hopes'?"
122Kg 4:29 Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take my staff in your hand and run. If you meet anyone, do not greet him, and if anyone greets you, do not answer. Lay my staff on the boy's face."
122Kg 4:30 But the child's mother said, "As surely as the LORD lives and as you live, I will not leave you." So he got up and followed her.
122Kg 4:31 Gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boy's face, but there was no sound or response. So Gehazi went back to meet Elisha and told him, "The boy has not awakened."
122Kg 4:32 When Elisha reached the house, there was the boy lying dead on his couch.
122Kg 4:33 He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the LORD.
122Kg 4:34 Then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands. As he stretched himself out upon him, the boy's body grew warm.
122Kg 4:35 Elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out upon him once more. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
122Kg 4:36 Elisha summoned Gehazi and said, "Call the Shunammite." And he did. When she came, he said, "Take your son."
122Kg 4:37 She came in, fell at his feet and bowed to the ground. Then she took her son and went out.
122Kg 4:38 Elisha returned to Gilgal and there was a famine in that region. While the company of the prophets was meeting with him, he said to his servant, "Put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men."
122Kg 4:39 One of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine. He gathered some of its gourds and filled the fold of his cloak. When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.
122Kg 4:40 The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" And they could not eat it.
122Kg 4:41 Elisha said, "Get some flour." He put it into the pot and said, "Serve it to the people to eat." And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
122Kg 4:42 A man came from Baal Shalishah, bringing the man of God twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain, along with some heads of new grain. "Give it to the people to eat," Elisha said.
122Kg 4:43 "How can I set this before a hundred men?" his servant asked. But Elisha answered, "Give it to the people to eat. For this is what the LORD says£º 'They will eat and have some left over.'"
122Kg 4:44 Then he set it before them, and they ate and had some left over, according to the word of the LORD.
122Kg 5:1 Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded, because through him the LORD had given victory to Aram. He was a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy.
122Kg 5:2 Now bands from Aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from Israel, and she served Naaman's wife.
122Kg 5:3 She said to her mistress, "If only my master would see the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy."
122Kg 5:4 Naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from Israel had said.
122Kg 5:5 "By all means, go," the king of Aram replied. "I will send a letter to the king of Israel." So Naaman left, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold and ten sets of clothing.
122Kg 5:6 The letter that he took to the king of Israel read£º "With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy."
122Kg 5:7 As soon as the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his robes and said, "Am I God? Can I kill and bring back to life? Why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy? See how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me!"
122Kg 5:8 When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his robes, he sent him this message£º "Why have you torn your robes? Have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in Israel."
122Kg 5:9 So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house.
122Kg 5:10 Elisha sent a messenger to say to him, "Go, wash yourself seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed."
122Kg 5:11 But Naaman went away angry and said, "I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy.
122Kg 5:12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than any of the waters of Israel? Couldn't I wash in them and be cleansed?" So he turned and went off in a rage.
122Kg 5:13 Naaman's servants went to him and said, "My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much more, then, when he tells you, 'Wash and be cleansed'!"
122Kg 5:14 So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as the man of God had told him, and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy.
122Kg 5:15 Then Naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of God. He stood before him and said, "Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. Please accept now a gift from your servant."
122Kg 5:16 The prophet answered, "As surely as the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will not accept a thing." And even though Naaman urged him, he refused.
122Kg 5:17 "If you will not," said Naaman, "please let me, your servant, be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry, for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the LORD.
122Kg 5:18 But may the LORD forgive your servant for this one thing£º When my master enters the temple of Rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and I bow there also--when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon, may the LORD forgive your servant for this."
122Kg 5:19 "Go in peace," Elisha said. After Naaman had traveled some distance,
122Kg 5:20 Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said to himself, "My master was too easy on Naaman, this Aramean, by not accepting from him what he brought. As surely as the LORD lives, I will run after him and get something from him."
122Kg 5:21 So Gehazi hurried after Naaman. When Naaman saw him running toward him, he got down from the chariot to meet him. "Is everything all right?" he asked.
122Kg 5:22 "Everything is all right," Gehazi answered. "My master sent me to say, 'Two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing.'"
122Kg 5:23 "By all means, take two talents," said Naaman. He urged Gehazi to accept them, and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags, with two sets of clothing. He gave them to two of his servants, and they carried them ahead of Gehazi.
122Kg 5:24 When Gehazi came to the hill, he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house. He sent the men away and they left.
122Kg 5:25 Then he went in and stood before his master Elisha. "Where have you been, Gehazi?" Elisha asked. "Your servant didn't go anywhere," Gehazi answered.
122Kg 5:26 But Elisha said to him, "Was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to take money, or to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, flocks, herds, or menservants and maidservants?
122Kg 5:27 Naaman's leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever." Then Gehazi went from Elisha's presence and he was leprous, as white as snow.
122Kg 6:1 The company of the prophets said to Elisha, "Look, the place where we meet with you is too small for us.
122Kg 6:2 Let us go to the Jordan, where each of us can get a pole; and let us build a place there for us to live." And he said, "Go."
122Kg 6:3 Then one of them said, "Won't you please come with your servants?" "I will," Elisha replied.
122Kg 6:4 And he went with them. They went to the Jordan and began to cut down trees.
122Kg 6:5 As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron axhead fell into the water. "Oh, my lord," he cried out, "it was borrowed!"
122Kg 6:6 The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it there, and made the iron float.
122Kg 6:7 "Lift it out," he said. Then the man reached out his hand and took it.
122Kg 6:8 Now the king of Aram was at war with Israel. After conferring with his officers, he said, "I will set up my camp in such and such a place."
122Kg 6:9 The man of God sent word to the king of Israel£º "Beware of passing that place, because the Arameans are going down there."
122Kg 6:10 So the king of Israel checked on the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he was on his guard in such places.
122Kg 6:11 This enraged the king of Aram. He summoned his officers and demanded of them, "Will you not tell me which of us is on the side of the king of Israel?"
122Kg 6:12 "None of us, my lord the king," said one of his officers, "but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the very words you speak in your bedroom."
122Kg 6:13 "Go, find out where he is," the king ordered, "so I can send men and capture him." The report came back£º "He is in Dothan."
122Kg 6:14 Then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there. They went by night and surrounded the city.
122Kg 6:15 When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. "Oh, my lord, what shall we do?" the servant asked.
122Kg 6:16 "Don't be afraid," the prophet answered. "Those who are with us are more than those who are with them."
122Kg 6:17 And Elisha prayed, "O LORD, open his eyes so he may see." Then the LORD opened the servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
122Kg 6:18 As the enemy came down toward him, Elisha prayed to the LORD, "Strike these people with blindness." So he struck them with blindness, as Elisha had asked.
122Kg 6:19 Elisha told them, "This is not the road and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are looking for." And he led them to Samaria.
122Kg 6:20 After they entered the city, Elisha said, "LORD, open the eyes of these men so they can see." Then the LORD opened their eyes and they looked, and there they were, inside Samaria.
122Kg 6:21 When the king of Israel saw them, he asked Elisha, "Shall I kill them, my father? Shall I kill them?"
122Kg 6:22 "Do not kill them," he answered. "Would you kill men you have captured with your own sword or bow? Set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master."
122Kg 6:23 So he prepared a great feast for them, and after they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them away, and they returned to their master. So the bands from Aram stopped raiding Israel's territory.
122Kg 6:24 Some time later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to Samaria.
122Kg 6:25 There was a great famine in the city; the siege lasted so long that a donkey's head sold for eighty shekels of silver, and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for five shekels.
122Kg 6:26 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, "Help me, my lord the king!"
122Kg 6:27 The king replied, "If the LORD does not help you, where can I get help for you? From the threshing floor? From the winepress?"
122Kg 6:28 Then he asked her, "What's the matter?" She answered, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.'
122Kg 6:29 So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I said to her, 'Give up your son so we may eat him,' but she had hidden him."
122Kg 6:30 When the king heard the woman's words, he tore his robes. As he went along the wall, the people looked, and there, underneath, he had sackcloth on his body.
122Kg 6:31 He said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!"
122Kg 6:32 Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Don't you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him. Is not the sound of his master's footsteps behind him?"
122Kg 6:33 While he was still talking to them, the messenger came down to him. And the king said, "This disaster is from the LORD. Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"
122Kg 7:1 Elisha said, "Hear the word of the LORD. This is what the LORD says£º About this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria."
122Kg 7:2 The officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of God, "Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?" "You will see it with your own eyes," answered Elisha, "but you will not eat any of it!"
122Kg 7:3 Now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate. They said to each other, "Why stay here until we die?
122Kg 7:4 If we say, 'We'll go into the city'--the famine is there, and we will die. And if we stay here, we will die. So let's go over to the camp of the Arameans and surrender. If they spare us, we live; if they kill us, then we die."
122Kg 7:5 At dusk they got up and went to the camp of the Arameans. When they reached the edge of the camp, not a man was there,
122Kg 7:6 for the Lord had caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army, so that they said to one another, "Look, the king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!"
122Kg 7:7 So they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys. They left the camp as it was and ran for their lives.
122Kg 7:8 The men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp and entered one of the tents. They ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold and clothes, and went off and hid them. They returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also.
122Kg 7:9 Then they said to each other, "We're not doing right. This is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves. If we wait until daylight, punishment will overtake us. Let's go at once and report this to the royal palace."
122Kg 7:10 So they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them, "We went into the Aramean camp and not a man was there--not a sound of anyone--only tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents left just as they were."
122Kg 7:11 The gatekeepers shouted the news, and it was reported within the palace.
122Kg 7:12 The king got up in the night and said to his officers, "I will tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving; so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside, thinking, 'They will surely come out, and then we will take them alive and get into the city.'"
122Kg 7:13 One of his officers answered, "Have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their plight will be like that of all the Israelites left here--yes, they will only be like all these Israelites who are doomed. So let us send them to find out what happened."
122Kg 7:14 So they selected two chariots with their horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army. He commanded the drivers, "Go and find out what has happened."
122Kg 7:15 They followed them as far as the Jordan, and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the Arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight. So the messengers returned and reported to the king.
122Kg 7:16 Then the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. So a seah of flour sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel, as the LORD had said.
122Kg 7:17 Now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate, and the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died, just as the man of God had foretold when the king came down to his house.
122Kg 7:18 It happened as the man of God had said to the king£º "About this time tomorrow, a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of Samaria."
122Kg 7:19 The officer had said to the man of God, "Look, even if the LORD should open the floodgates of the heavens, could this happen?" The man of God had replied, "You will see it with your own eyes, but you will not eat any of it!"
122Kg 7:20 And that is exactly what happened to him, for the people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.
122Kg 8:1 Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, "Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the LORD has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years."
122Kg 8:2 The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years.
122Kg 8:3 At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to the king to beg for her house and land.
122Kg 8:4 The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, "Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done."
122Kg 8:5 Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to beg the king for her house and land. Gehazi said, "This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life."
122Kg 8:6 The king asked the woman about it, and she told him. Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, "Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now."
122Kg 8:7 Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, "The man of God has come all the way up here,"
122Kg 8:8 he said to Hazael, "Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the LORD through him; ask him, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"
122Kg 8:9 Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the finest wares of Damascus. He went in and stood before him, and said, "Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"
122Kg 8:10 Elisha answered, "Go and say to him, 'You will certainly recover'; but the LORD has revealed to me that he will in fact die."
122Kg 8:11 He stared at him with a fixed gaze until Hazael felt ashamed. Then the man of God began to weep.
122Kg 8:12 "Why is my lord weeping?" asked Hazael. "Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites," he answered. "You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women."
122Kg 8:13 Hazael said, "How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?" "The LORD has shown me that you will become king of Aram," answered Elisha.
122Kg 8:14 Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, "What did Elisha say to you?" Hazael replied, "He told me that you would certainly recover."
122Kg 8:15 But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king's face, so that he died. Then Hazael succeeded him as king.
122Kg 8:16 In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah.
122Kg 8:17 He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
122Kg 8:18 He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.
122Kg 8:19 Nevertheless, for the sake of his servant David, the LORD was not willing to destroy Judah. He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever.
122Kg 8:20 In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.
122Kg 8:21 So Jehoram went to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night; his army, however, fled back home.
122Kg 8:22 To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time.
122Kg 8:23 As for the other events of Jehoram's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 8:24 Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
122Kg 8:26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.
122Kg 8:27 He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was related by marriage to Ahab's family.
122Kg 8:28 Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;
122Kg 8:29 so King Joram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab, because he had been wounded.
122Kg 9:1 The prophet Elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him, "Tuck your cloak into your belt, take this flask of oil with you and go to Ramoth Gilead.
122Kg 9:2 When you get there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go to him, get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room.
122Kg 9:3 Then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare, 'This is what the LORD says£º I anoint you king over Israel.' Then open the door and run; don't delay!"
122Kg 9:4 So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead.
122Kg 9:5 When he arrived, he found the army officers sitting together. "I have a message for you, commander," he said. "For which of us?" asked Jehu. "For you, commander," he replied.
122Kg 9:6 Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the prophet poured the oil on Jehu's head and declared, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º 'I anoint you king over the LORD'S people Israel.
122Kg 9:7 You are to destroy the house of Ahab your master, and I will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the LORD'S servants shed by Jezebel.
122Kg 9:8 The whole house of Ahab will perish. I will cut off from Ahab every last male in Israel--slave or free.
122Kg 9:9 I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
122Kg 9:10 As for Jezebel, dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.'" Then he opened the door and ran.
122Kg 9:11 When Jehu went out to his fellow officers, one of them asked him, "Is everything all right? Why did this madman come to you?" "You know the man and the sort of things he says," Jehu replied.
122Kg 9:12 "That's not true!" they said. "Tell us." Jehu said, "Here is what he told me£º 'This is what the LORD says£º I anoint you king over Israel.'"
122Kg 9:13 They hurried and took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps. Then they blew the trumpet and shouted, "Jehu is king!"
122Kg 9:14 So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth Gilead against Hazael king of Aram,
122Kg 9:15 but King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds the Arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with Hazael king of Aram.) Jehu said, "If this is the way you feel, don't let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel."
122Kg 9:16 Then he got into his chariot and rode to Jezreel, because Joram was resting there and Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
122Kg 9:17 When the lookout standing on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu's troops approaching, he called out, "I see some troops coming." "Get a horseman," Joram ordered. "Send him to meet them and ask, 'Do you come in peace?'"
122Kg 9:18 The horseman rode off to meet Jehu and said, "This is what the king says£º 'Do you come in peace?'" "What do you have to do with peace?" Jehu replied. "Fall in behind me." The lookout reported, "The messenger has reached them, but he isn't coming back."
122Kg 9:19 So the king sent out a second horseman. When he came to them he said, "This is what the king says£º 'Do you come in peace?'" Jehu replied, "What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me."
122Kg 9:20 The lookout reported, "He has reached them, but he isn't coming back either. The driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi--he drives like a madman."
122Kg 9:21 "Hitch up my chariot," Joram ordered. And when it was hitched up, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah rode out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.
122Kg 9:22 When Joram saw Jehu he asked, "Have you come in peace, Jehu?" "How can there be peace," Jehu replied, "as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?"
122Kg 9:23 Joram turned about and fled, calling out to Ahaziah, "Treachery, Ahaziah!"
122Kg 9:24 Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot.
122Kg 9:25 Jehu said to Bidkar, his chariot officer, "Pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember how you and I were riding together in chariots behind Ahab his father when the LORD made this prophecy about him£º
122Kg 9:26 'Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the LORD, and I will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground, declares the LORD.' Now then, pick him up and throw him on that plot, in accordance with the word of the LORD."
122Kg 9:27 When Ahaziah king of Judah saw what had happened, he fled up the road to Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, shouting, "Kill him too!" They wounded him in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam, but he escaped to Megiddo and died there.
122Kg 9:28 His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the City of David.
122Kg 9:29 (In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah had become king of Judah.)
122Kg 9:30 Then Jehu went to Jezreel. When Jezebel heard about it, she painted her eyes, arranged her hair and looked out of a window.
122Kg 9:31 As Jehu entered the gate, she asked, "Have you come in peace, Zimri, you murderer of your master?"
122Kg 9:32 He looked up at the window and called out, "Who is on my side? Who?" Two or three eunuchs looked down at him.
122Kg 9:33 "Throw her down!" Jehu said. So they threw her down, and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot.
122Kg 9:34 Jehu went in and ate and drank. "Take care of that cursed woman," he said, "and bury her, for she was a king's daughter."
122Kg 9:35 But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing except her skull, her feet and her hands.
122Kg 9:36 They went back and told Jehu, who said, "This is the word of the LORD that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite£º On the plot of ground at Jezreel dogs will devour Jezebel's flesh.
122Kg 9:37 Jezebel's body will be like refuse on the ground in the plot at Jezreel, so that no one will be able to say, 'This is Jezebel.'"
122Kg 10:1 Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria£º to the officials of Jezreel, to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab's children. He said,
122Kg 10:2 "As soon as this letter reaches you, since your master's sons are with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons,
122Kg 10:3 choose the best and most worthy of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne. Then fight for your master's house."
122Kg 10:4 But they were terrified and said, "If two kings could not resist him, how can we?"
122Kg 10:5 So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu£º "We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best."
122Kg 10:6 Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, "If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow." Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them.
122Kg 10:7 When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel.
122Kg 10:8 When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, "They have brought the heads of the princes." Then Jehu ordered, "Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning."
122Kg 10:9 The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, "You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these?
122Kg 10:10 Know then, that not a word the LORD has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The LORD has done what he promised through his servant Elijah."
122Kg 10:11 So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor.
122Kg 10:12 Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds,
122Kg 10:13 he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, "Who are you?" They said, "We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother."
122Kg 10:14 "Take them alive!" he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked--forty-two men. He left no survivor.
122Kg 10:15 After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Recab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, "Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?" "I am," Jehonadab answered. "If so," said Jehu, "give me your hand." So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot.
122Kg 10:16 Jehu said, "Come with me and see my zeal for the LORD." Then he had him ride along in his chariot.
122Kg 10:17 When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab's family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the LORD spoken to Elijah.
122Kg 10:18 Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, "Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.
122Kg 10:19 Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his ministers and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live." But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the ministers of Baal.
122Kg 10:20 Jehu said, "Call an assembly in honor of Baal." So they proclaimed it.
122Kg 10:21 Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the ministers of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other.
122Kg 10:22 And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, "Bring robes for all the ministers of Baal." So he brought out robes for them.
122Kg 10:23 Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Recab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the ministers of Baal, "Look around and see that no servants of the LORD are here with you--only ministers of Baal."
122Kg 10:24 So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning£º "If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life."
122Kg 10:25 As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers£º "Go in and kill them; let no one escape." So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal.
122Kg 10:26 They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it.
122Kg 10:27 They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal, and people have used it for a latrine to this day.
122Kg 10:28 So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel.
122Kg 10:29 However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit--the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan.
122Kg 10:30 The LORD said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind to do, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation."
122Kg 10:31 Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 10:32 In those days the LORD began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael overpowered the Israelites throughout their territory
122Kg 10:33 east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan.
122Kg 10:34 As for the other events of Jehu's reign, all he did, and all his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
122Kg 10:35 Jehu rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 10:36 The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
122Kg 11:1 When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family.
122Kg 11:2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes, who were about to be murdered. She put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah; so he was not killed.
122Kg 11:3 He remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the LORD for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
122Kg 11:4 In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred, the Carites and the guards and had them brought to him at the temple of the LORD. He made a covenant with them and put them under oath at the temple of the LORD. Then he showed them the king's son.
122Kg 11:5 He commanded them, saying, "This is what you are to do£º You who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the Sabbath--a third of you guarding the royal palace,
122Kg 11:6 a third at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guard, who take turns guarding the temple--
122Kg 11:7 and you who are in the other two companies that normally go off Sabbath duty are all to guard the temple for the king.
122Kg 11:8 Station yourselves around the king, each man with his weapon in his hand. Anyone who approaches your ranks must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes."
122Kg 11:9 The commanders of units of a hundred did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men--those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty--and came to Jehoiada the priest.
122Kg 11:10 Then he gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 11:11 The guards, each with his weapon in his hand, stationed themselves around the king--near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
122Kg 11:12 Jehoiada brought out the king's son and put the crown on him; he presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him, and the people clapped their hands and shouted, "Long live the king!"
122Kg 11:13 When Athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people, she went to the people at the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 11:14 She looked and there was the king, standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her robes and called out, "Treason! Treason!"
122Kg 11:15 Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops£º "Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "She must not be put to death in the temple of the LORD."
122Kg 11:16 So they seized her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds, and there she was put to death.
122Kg 11:17 Jehoiada then made a covenant between the LORD and the king and people that they would be the LORD'S people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.
122Kg 11:18 All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. Then Jehoiada the priest posted guards at the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 11:19 He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards and all the people of the land, and together they brought the king down from the temple of the LORD and went into the palace, entering by way of the gate of the guards. The king then took his place on the royal throne,
122Kg 11:20 and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword at the palace.
122Kg 11:21 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign.
122Kg 12:1 In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.
122Kg 12:2 Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
122Kg 12:3 The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
122Kg 12:4 Joash said to the priests, "Collect all the money that is brought as sacred offerings to the temple of the LORD--the money collected in the census, the money received from personal vows and the money brought voluntarily to the temple.
122Kg 12:5 Let every priest receive the money from one of the treasurers, and let it be used to repair whatever damage is found in the temple."
122Kg 12:6 But by the twenty-third year of King Joash the priests still had not repaired the temple.
122Kg 12:7 Therefore King Joash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and asked them, "Why aren't you repairing the damage done to the temple? Take no more money from your treasurers, but hand it over for repairing the temple."
122Kg 12:8 The priests agreed that they would not collect any more money from the people and that they would not repair the temple themselves.
122Kg 12:9 Jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid. He placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one enters the temple of the LORD. The priests who guarded the entrance put into the chest all the money that was brought to the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 12:10 Whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest, the royal secretary and the high priest came, counted the money that had been brought into the temple of the LORD and put it into bags.
122Kg 12:11 When the amount had been determined, they gave the money to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. With it they paid those who worked on the temple of the LORD--the carpenters and builders,
122Kg 12:12 the masons and stonecutters. They purchased timber and dressed stone for the repair of the temple of the LORD, and met all the other expenses of restoring the temple.
122Kg 12:13 The money brought into the temple was not spent for making silver basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets or any other articles of gold or silver for the temple of the LORD;
122Kg 12:14 it was paid to the workmen, who used it to repair the temple.
122Kg 12:15 They did not require an accounting from those to whom they gave the money to pay the workers, because they acted with complete honesty.
122Kg 12:16 The money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the temple of the LORD; it belonged to the priests.
122Kg 12:17 About this time Hazael king of Aram went up and attacked Gath and captured it. Then he turned to attack Jerusalem.
122Kg 12:18 But Joash king of Judah took all the sacred objects dedicated by his fathers--Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, the kings of Judah--and the gifts he himself had dedicated and all the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of the LORD and of the royal palace, and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram, who then withdrew from Jerusalem.
122Kg 12:19 As for the other events of the reign of Joash, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 12:20 His officials conspired against him and assassinated him at Beth Millo, on the road down to Silla.
122Kg 12:21 The officials who murdered him were Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer. He died and was buried with his fathers in the City of David. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 13:1 In the twenty-third year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.
122Kg 13:2 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD by following the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit, and he did not turn away from them.
122Kg 13:3 So the LORD'S anger burned against Israel, and for a long time he kept them under the power of Hazael king of Aram and Ben-Hadad his son.
122Kg 13:4 Then Jehoahaz sought the LORD'S favor, and the LORD listened to him, for he saw how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel.
122Kg 13:5 The LORD provided a deliverer for Israel, and they escaped from the power of Aram. So the Israelites lived in their own homes as they had before.
122Kg 13:6 But they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit; they continued in them. Also, the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria.
122Kg 13:7 Nothing had been left of the army of Jehoahaz except fifty horsemen, ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Aram had destroyed the rest and made them like the dust at threshing time.
122Kg 13:8 As for the other events of the reign of Jehoahaz, all he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
122Kg 13:9 Jehoahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoash his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.
122Kg 13:11 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he continued in them.
122Kg 13:12 As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash, all he did and his achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
122Kg 13:13 Jehoash rested with his fathers, and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
122Kg 13:14 Now Elisha was suffering from the illness from which he died. Jehoash king of Israel went down to see him and wept over him. "My father! My father!" he cried. "The chariots and horsemen of Israel!"
122Kg 13:15 Elisha said, "Get a bow and some arrows," and he did so.
122Kg 13:16 "Take the bow in your hands," he said to the king of Israel. When he had taken it, Elisha put his hands on the king's hands.
122Kg 13:17 "Open the east window," he said, and he opened it. "Shoot!" Elisha said, and he shot. "The LORD'S arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram!" Elisha declared. "You will completely destroy the Arameans at Aphek."
122Kg 13:18 Then he said, "Take the arrows," and the king took them. Elisha told him, "Strike the ground." He struck it three times and stopped.
122Kg 13:19 The man of God was angry with him and said, "You should have struck the ground five or six times; then you would have defeated Aram and completely destroyed it. But now you will defeat it only three times."
122Kg 13:20 Elisha died and was buried. Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring.
122Kg 13:21 Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders; so they threw the man's body into Elisha's tomb. When the body touched Elisha's bones, the man came to life and stood up on his feet.
122Kg 13:22 Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz.
122Kg 13:23 But the LORD was gracious to them and had compassion and showed concern for them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. To this day he has been unwilling to destroy them or banish them from his presence.
122Kg 13:24 Hazael king of Aram died, and Ben-Hadad his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 13:25 Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recaptured from Ben-Hadad son of Hazael the towns he had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Three times Jehoash defeated him, and so he recovered the Israelite towns.
122Kg 14:1 In the second year of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah began to reign.
122Kg 14:2 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Jehoaddin; she was from Jerusalem.
122Kg 14:3 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not as his father David had done. In everything he followed the example of his father Joash.
122Kg 14:4 The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
122Kg 14:5 After the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king.
122Kg 14:6 Yet he did not put the sons of the assassins to death, in accordance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses where the LORD commanded£º "Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sins."
122Kg 14:7 He was the one who defeated ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela in battle, calling it Joktheel, the name it has to this day.
122Kg 14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, with the challenge£º "Come, meet me face to face."
122Kg 14:9 But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah£º "A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.
122Kg 14:10 You have indeed defeated Edom and now you are arrogant. Glory in your victory, but stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?"
122Kg 14:11 Amaziah, however, would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
122Kg 14:12 Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
122Kg 14:13 Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash went to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate--a section about six hundred feet long.
122Kg 14:14 He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace. He also took hostages and returned to Samaria.
122Kg 14:15 As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash, what he did and his achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
122Kg 14:16 Jehoash rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. And Jeroboam his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 14:17 Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
122Kg 14:18 As for the other events of Amaziah's reign, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 14:19 They conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
122Kg 14:20 He was brought back by horse and was buried in Jerusalem with his fathers, in the City of David.
122Kg 14:21 Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
122Kg 14:22 He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his fathers.
122Kg 14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Jehoash king of Israel became king in Samaria, and he reigned forty-one years.
122Kg 14:24 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 14:25 He was the one who restored the boundaries of Israel from Lebo Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, in accordance with the word of the LORD, the God of Israel, spoken through his servant Jonah son of Amittai, the prophet from Gath Hepher.
122Kg 14:26 The LORD had seen how bitterly everyone in Israel, whether slave or free, was suffering; there was no one to help them.
122Kg 14:27 And since the LORD had not said he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven, he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash.
122Kg 14:28 As for the other events of Jeroboam's reign, all he did, and his military achievements, including how he recovered for Israel both Damascus and Hamath, which had belonged to Yaudi, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
122Kg 14:29 Jeroboam rested with his fathers, the kings of Israel. And Zechariah his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 15:1 In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah began to reign.
122Kg 15:2 He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother's name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem.
122Kg 15:3 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.
122Kg 15:4 The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.
122Kg 15:5 The LORD afflicted the king with leprosy until the day he died, and he lived in a separate house. Jotham the king's son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
122Kg 15:6 As for the other events of Azariah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 15:7 Azariah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in the City of David. And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 15:8 In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned six months.
122Kg 15:9 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his fathers had done. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 15:10 Shallum son of Jabesh conspired against Zechariah. He attacked him in front of the people, assassinated him and succeeded him as king.
122Kg 15:11 The other events of Zechariah's reign are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:12 So the word of the LORD spoken to Jehu was fulfilled£º "Your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation."
122Kg 15:13 Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, and he reigned in Samaria one month.
122Kg 15:14 Then Menahem son of Gadi went from Tirzah up to Samaria. He attacked Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria, assassinated him and succeeded him as king.
122Kg 15:15 The other events of Shallum's reign, and the conspiracy he led, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:16 At that time Menahem, starting out from Tirzah, attacked Tiphsah and everyone in the city and its vicinity, because they refused to open their gates. He sacked Tiphsah and ripped open all the pregnant women.
122Kg 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king of Israel, and he reigned in Samaria ten years.
122Kg 15:18 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD. During his entire reign he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 15:19 Then Pul king of Assyria invaded the land, and Menahem gave him a thousand talents of silver to gain his support and strengthen his own hold on the kingdom.
122Kg 15:20 Menahem exacted this money from Israel. Every wealthy man had to contribute fifty shekels of silver to be given to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria withdrew and stayed in the land no longer.
122Kg 15:21 As for the other events of Menahem's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
122Kg 15:22 Menahem rested with his fathers. And Pekahiah his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned two years.
122Kg 15:24 Pekahiah did evil in the eyes of the LORD. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 15:25 One of his chief officers, Pekah son of Remaliah, conspired against him. Taking fifty men of Gilead with him, he assassinated Pekahiah, along with Argob and Arieh, in the citadel of the royal palace at Samaria. So Pekah killed Pekahiah and succeeded him as king.
122Kg 15:26 The other events of Pekahiah's reign, and all he did, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:27 In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twenty years.
122Kg 15:28 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit.
122Kg 15:29 In the time of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came and took Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh and Hazor. He took Gilead and Galilee, including all the land of Naphtali, and deported the people to Assyria.
122Kg 15:30 Then Hoshea son of Elah conspired against Pekah son of Remaliah. He attacked and assassinated him, and then succeeded him as king in the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah.
122Kg 15:31 As for the other events of Pekah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel?
122Kg 15:32 In the second year of Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah king of Judah began to reign.
122Kg 15:33 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother's name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
122Kg 15:34 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done.
122Kg 15:35 The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 15:36 As for the other events of Jotham's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 15:37 (In those days the LORD began to send Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.)
122Kg 15:38 Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David, the city of his father. And Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.
122Kg 16:2 Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
122Kg 16:3 He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and even sacrificed his son in the fire, following the detestable ways of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
122Kg 16:4 He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.
122Kg 16:5 Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem and besieged Ahaz, but they could not overpower him.
122Kg 16:6 At that time, Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram by driving out the men of Judah. Edomites then moved into Elath and have lived there to this day.
122Kg 16:7 Ahaz sent messengers to say to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, "I am your servant and vassal. Come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Aram and of the king of Israel, who are attacking me."
122Kg 16:8 And Ahaz took the silver and gold found in the temple of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.
122Kg 16:9 The king of Assyria complied by attacking Damascus and capturing it. He deported its inhabitants to Kir and put Rezin to death.
122Kg 16:10 Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria. He saw an altar in Damascus and sent to Uriah the priest a sketch of the altar, with detailed plans for its construction.
122Kg 16:11 So Uriah the priest built an altar in accordance with all the plans that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus and finished it before King Ahaz returned.
122Kg 16:12 When the king came back from Damascus and saw the altar, he approached it and presented offerings on it.
122Kg 16:13 He offered up his burnt offering and grain offering, poured out his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offerings on the altar.
122Kg 16:14 The bronze altar that stood before the LORD he brought from the front of the temple--from between the new altar and the temple of the LORD--and put it on the north side of the new altar.
122Kg 16:15 King Ahaz then gave these orders to Uriah the priest£º "On the large new altar, offer the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering, the king's burnt offering and his grain offering, and the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their grain offering and their drink offering. Sprinkle on the altar all the blood of the burnt offerings and sacrifices. But I will use the bronze altar for seeking guidance."
122Kg 16:16 And Uriah the priest did just as King Ahaz had ordered.
122Kg 16:17 King Ahaz took away the side panels and removed the basins from the movable stands. He removed the Sea from the bronze bulls that supported it and set it on a stone base.
122Kg 16:18 He took away the Sabbath canopy that had been built at the temple and removed the royal entryway outside the temple of the LORD, in deference to the king of Assyria.
122Kg 16:19 As for the other events of the reign of Ahaz, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 16:20 Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 17:1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years.
122Kg 17:2 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, but not like the kings of Israel who preceded him.
122Kg 17:3 Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up to attack Hoshea, who had been Shalmaneser's vassal and had paid him tribute.
122Kg 17:4 But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was a traitor, for he had sent envoys to So king of Egypt, and he no longer paid tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year. Therefore Shalmaneser seized him and put him in prison.
122Kg 17:5 The king of Assyria invaded the entire land, marched against Samaria and laid siege to it for three years.
122Kg 17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in the towns of the Medes.
122Kg 17:7 All this took place because the Israelites had sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them up out of Egypt from under the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshiped other gods
122Kg 17:8 and followed the practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before them, as well as the practices that the kings of Israel had introduced.
122Kg 17:9 The Israelites secretly did things against the LORD their God that were not right. From watchtower to fortified city they built themselves high places in all their towns.
122Kg 17:10 They set up sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree.
122Kg 17:11 At every high place they burned incense, as the nations whom the LORD had driven out before them had done. They did wicked things that provoked the LORD to anger.
122Kg 17:12 They worshiped idols, though the LORD had said, "You shall not do this."
122Kg 17:13 The LORD warned Israel and Judah through all his prophets and seers£º "Turn from your evil ways. Observe my commands and decrees, in accordance with the entire Law that I commanded your fathers to obey and that I delivered to you through my servants the prophets."
122Kg 17:14 But they would not listen and were as stiff-necked as their fathers, who did not trust in the LORD their God.
122Kg 17:15 They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their fathers and the warnings he had given them. They followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless. They imitated the nations around them although the LORD had ordered them, "Do not do as they do," and they did the things the LORD had forbidden them to do.
122Kg 17:16 They forsook all the commands of the LORD their God and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves, and an Asherah pole. They bowed down to all the starry hosts, and they worshiped Baal.
122Kg 17:17 They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire. They practiced divination and sorcery and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
122Kg 17:18 So the LORD was very angry with Israel and removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left,
122Kg 17:19 and even Judah did not keep the commands of the LORD their God. They followed the practices Israel had introduced.
122Kg 17:20 Therefore the LORD rejected all the people of Israel; he afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers, until he thrust them from his presence.
122Kg 17:21 When he tore Israel away from the house of David, they made Jeroboam son of Nebat their king. Jeroboam enticed Israel away from following the LORD and caused them to commit a great sin.
122Kg 17:22 The Israelites persisted in all the sins of Jeroboam and did not turn away from them
122Kg 17:23 until the LORD removed them from his presence, as he had warned through all his servants the prophets. So the people of Israel were taken from their homeland into exile in Assyria, and they are still there.
122Kg 17:24 The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites. They took over Samaria and lived in its towns.
122Kg 17:25 When they first lived there, they did not worship the LORD; so he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people.
122Kg 17:26 It was reported to the king of Assyria£º "The people you deported and resettled in the towns of Samaria do not know what the god of that country requires. He has sent lions among them, which are killing them off, because the people do not know what he requires."
122Kg 17:27 Then the king of Assyria gave this order£º "Have one of the priests you took captive from Samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires."
122Kg 17:28 So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria came to live in Bethel and taught them how to worship the LORD.
122Kg 17:29 Nevertheless, each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled, and set them up in the shrines the people of Samaria had made at the high places.
122Kg 17:30 The men from Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men from Cuthah made Nergal, and the men from Hamath made Ashima;
122Kg 17:31 the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
122Kg 17:32 They worshiped the LORD, but they also appointed all sorts of their own people to officiate for them as priests in the shrines at the high places.
122Kg 17:33 They worshiped the LORD, but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought.
122Kg 17:34 To this day they persist in their former practices. They neither worship the LORD nor adhere to the decrees and ordinances, the laws and commands that the LORD gave the descendants of Jacob, whom he named Israel.
122Kg 17:35 When the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites, he commanded them£º "Do not worship any other gods or bow down to them, serve them or sacrifice to them.
122Kg 17:36 But the LORD, who brought you up out of Egypt with mighty power and outstretched arm, is the one you must worship. To him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices.
122Kg 17:37 You must always be careful to keep the decrees and ordinances, the laws and commands he wrote for you. Do not worship other gods.
122Kg 17:38 Do not forget the covenant I have made with you, and do not worship other gods.
122Kg 17:39 Rather, worship the LORD your God; it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies."
122Kg 17:40 They would not listen, however, but persisted in their former practices.
122Kg 17:41 Even while these people were worshiping the LORD, they were serving their idols. To this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their fathers did.
122Kg 18:1 In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign.
122Kg 18:2 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
122Kg 18:3 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had done.
122Kg 18:4 He removed the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan.)
122Kg 18:5 Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before him or after him.
122Kg 18:6 He held fast to the LORD and did not cease to follow him; he kept the commands the LORD had given Moses.
122Kg 18:7 And the LORD was with him; he was successful in whatever he undertook. He rebelled against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.
122Kg 18:8 From watchtower to fortified city, he defeated the Philistines, as far as Gaza and its territory.
122Kg 18:9 In King Hezekiah's fourth year, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched against Samaria and laid siege to it.
122Kg 18:10 At the end of three years the Assyrians took it. So Samaria was captured in Hezekiah's sixth year, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.
122Kg 18:11 The king of Assyria deported Israel to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River and in towns of the Medes.
122Kg 18:12 This happened because they had not obeyed the LORD their God, but had violated his covenant--all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. They neither listened to the commands nor carried them out.
122Kg 18:13 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
122Kg 18:14 So Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish£º "I have done wrong. Withdraw from me, and I will pay whatever you demand of me." The king of Assyria exacted from Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
122Kg 18:15 So Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the LORD and in the treasuries of the royal palace.
122Kg 18:16 At this time Hezekiah king of Judah stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the LORD, and gave it to the king of Assyria.
122Kg 18:17 The king of Assyria sent his supreme commander, his chief officer and his field commander with a large army, from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They came up to Jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field.
122Kg 18:18 They called for the king; and Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to them.
122Kg 18:19 The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah£º "'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says£º On what are you basing this confidence of yours?
122Kg 18:20 You say you have strategy and military strength--but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?
122Kg 18:21 Look now, you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces a man's hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
122Kg 18:22 And if you say to me, "We are depending on the LORD our God"--isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar in Jerusalem"?
122Kg 18:23 "'Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria£º I will give you two thousand horses--if you can put riders on them!
122Kg 18:24 How can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
122Kg 18:25 Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this place without word from the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'"
122Kg 18:26 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."
122Kg 18:27 But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the men sitting on the wall--who, like you, will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine?"
122Kg 18:28 Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew£º "Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!
122Kg 18:29 This is what the king says£º Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand.
122Kg 18:30 Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, 'The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
122Kg 18:31 "Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says£º Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,
122Kg 18:32 until I come and take you to a land like your own, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey. Choose life and not death! "Do not listen to Hezekiah, for he is misleading you when he says, 'The LORD will deliver us.'
122Kg 18:33 Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
122Kg 18:34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Ivvah? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
122Kg 18:35 Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"
122Kg 18:36 But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."
122Kg 18:37 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.
122Kg 19:1 When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 19:2 He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
122Kg 19:3 They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says£º This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.
122Kg 19:4 It may be that the LORD your God will hear all the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives."
122Kg 19:5 When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah,
122Kg 19:6 Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says£º Do not be afraid of what you have heard--those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
122Kg 19:7 Listen! I am going to put such a spirit in him that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'"
122Kg 19:8 When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
122Kg 19:9 Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt, was marching out to fight against him. So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word£º
122Kg 19:10 "Say to Hezekiah king of Judah£º Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
122Kg 19:11 Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
122Kg 19:12 Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them£º the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?
122Kg 19:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"
122Kg 19:14 Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
122Kg 19:15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD£º "O LORD, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
122Kg 19:16 Give ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.
122Kg 19:17 "It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands.
122Kg 19:18 They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by men's hands.
122Kg 19:19 Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God."
122Kg 19:20 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah£º "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º I have heard your prayer concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria.
122Kg 19:21 This is the word that the LORD has spoken against him£º "'The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you. The Daughter of Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.
122Kg 19:22 Who is it you have insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
122Kg 19:23 By your messengers you have heaped insults on the Lord. And you have said, "With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I have reached its remotest parts, the finest of its forests.
122Kg 19:24 I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt."
122Kg 19:25 "'Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.
122Kg 19:26 Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up.
122Kg 19:27 "'But I know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me.
122Kg 19:28 Because you rage against me and your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.'
122Kg 19:29 "This will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah£º "This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
122Kg 19:30 Once more a remnant of the house of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above.
122Kg 19:31 For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.
122Kg 19:32 "Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria£º "He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
122Kg 19:33 By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city, declares the LORD.
122Kg 19:34 I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant."
122Kg 19:35 That night the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning--there were all the dead bodies!
122Kg 19:36 So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
122Kg 19:37 One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 20:1 In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, "This is what the LORD says£º Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover."
122Kg 20:2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
122Kg 20:3 "Remember, O LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
122Kg 20:4 Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the LORD came to him£º
122Kg 20:5 "Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people, 'This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says£º I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will heal you. On the third day from now you will go up to the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 20:6 I will add fifteen years to your life. And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.'"
122Kg 20:7 Then Isaiah said, "Prepare a poultice of figs." They did so and applied it to the boil, and he recovered.
122Kg 20:8 Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, "What will be the sign that the LORD will heal me and that I will go up to the temple of the LORD on the third day from now?"
122Kg 20:9 Isaiah answered, "This is the LORD'S sign to you that the LORD will do what he has promised£º Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or shall it go back ten steps?"
122Kg 20:10 "It is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps," said Hezekiah. "Rather, have it go back ten steps."
122Kg 20:11 Then the prophet Isaiah called upon the LORD, and the LORD made the shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.
122Kg 20:12 At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of Hezekiah's illness.
122Kg 20:13 Hezekiah received the messengers and showed them all that was in his storehouses--the silver, the gold, the spices and the fine oil--his armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
122Kg 20:14 Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, "What did those men say, and where did they come from?" "From a distant land," Hezekiah replied. "They came from Babylon."
122Kg 20:15 The prophet asked, "What did they see in your palace?" "They saw everything in my palace," Hezekiah said. "There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them."
122Kg 20:16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD£º
122Kg 20:17 The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.
122Kg 20:18 And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood, that will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
122Kg 20:19 "The word of the LORD you have spoken is good," Hezekiah replied. For he thought, "Will there not be peace and security in my lifetime?"
122Kg 20:20 As for the other events of Hezekiah's reign, all his achievements and how he made the pool and the tunnel by which he brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 20:21 Hezekiah rested with his fathers. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His mother's name was Hephzibah.
122Kg 21:2 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
122Kg 21:3 He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had destroyed; he also erected altars to Baal and made an Asherah pole, as Ahab king of Israel had done. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.
122Kg 21:4 He built altars in the temple of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "In Jerusalem I will put my Name."
122Kg 21:5 In both courts of the temple of the LORD, he built altars to all the starry hosts.
122Kg 21:6 He sacrificed his own son in the fire, practiced sorcery and divination, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
122Kg 21:7 He took the carved Asherah pole he had made and put it in the temple, of which the LORD had said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever.
122Kg 21:8 I will not again make the feet of the Israelites wander from the land I gave their forefathers, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them and will keep the whole Law that my servant Moses gave them."
122Kg 21:9 But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
122Kg 21:10 The LORD said through his servants the prophets£º
122Kg 21:11 "Manasseh king of Judah has committed these detestable sins. He has done more evil than the Amorites who preceded him and has led Judah into sin with his idols.
122Kg 21:12 Therefore this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º I am going to bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle.
122Kg 21:13 I will stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line used against Samaria and the plumb line used against the house of Ahab. I will wipe out Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
122Kg 21:14 I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and hand them over to their enemies. They will be looted and plundered by all their foes,
122Kg 21:15 because they have done evil in my eyes and have provoked me to anger from the day their forefathers came out of Egypt until this day."
122Kg 21:16 Moreover, Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem from end to end--besides the sin that he had caused Judah to commit, so that they did evil in the eyes of the LORD.
122Kg 21:17 As for the other events of Manasseh's reign, and all he did, including the sin he committed, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 21:18 Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace garden, the garden of Uzza. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 21:19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother's name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz; she was from Jotbah.
122Kg 21:20 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done.
122Kg 21:21 He walked in all the ways of his father; he worshiped the idols his father had worshiped, and bowed down to them.
122Kg 21:22 He forsook the LORD, the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the LORD.
122Kg 21:23 Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace.
122Kg 21:24 Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.
122Kg 21:25 As for the other events of Amon's reign, and what he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 21:26 He was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza. And Josiah his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother's name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath.
122Kg 22:2 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in all the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.
122Kg 22:3 In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent the secretary, Shaphan son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the temple of the LORD. He said£º
122Kg 22:4 "Go up to Hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the LORD, which the doorkeepers have collected from the people.
122Kg 22:5 Have them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple. And have these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the LORD--
122Kg 22:6 the carpenters, the builders and the masons. Also have them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple.
122Kg 22:7 But they need not account for the money entrusted to them, because they are acting faithfully."
122Kg 22:8 Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD." He gave it to Shaphan, who read it.
122Kg 22:9 Then Shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him£º "Your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple."
122Kg 22:10 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
122Kg 22:11 When the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his robes.
122Kg 22:12 He gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king's attendant£º
122Kg 22:13 "Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for the people and for all Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the LORD'S anger that burns against us because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us."
122Kg 22:14 Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan and Asaiah went to speak to the prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.
122Kg 22:15 She said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º Tell the man who sent you to me,
122Kg 22:16 'This is what the LORD says£º I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people, according to everything written in the book the king of Judah has read.
122Kg 22:17 Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all the idols their hands have made, my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched.'
122Kg 22:18 Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard£º
122Kg 22:19 Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I have spoken against this place and its people, that they would become accursed and laid waste, and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD.
122Kg 22:20 Therefore I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place.'" So they took her answer back to the king.
122Kg 23:1 Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
122Kg 23:2 He went up to the temple of the LORD with the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, the priests and the prophets--all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 23:3 The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the LORD--to follow the LORD and keep his commands, regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant.
122Kg 23:4 The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the LORD all the articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel.
122Kg 23:5 He did away with the pagan priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem--those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts.
122Kg 23:6 He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the LORD to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there. He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people.
122Kg 23:7 He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes, which were in the temple of the LORD and where women did weaving for Asherah.
122Kg 23:8 Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He broke down the shrines at the gates--at the entrance to the Gate of Joshua, the city governor, which is on the left of the city gate.
122Kg 23:9 Although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests.
122Kg 23:10 He desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one could use it to sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire to Molech.
122Kg 23:11 He removed from the entrance to the temple of the LORD the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court near the room of an official named Nathan-Melech. Josiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun.
122Kg 23:12 He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the LORD. He removed them from there, smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley.
122Kg 23:13 The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption--the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molech the detestable god of the people of Ammon.
122Kg 23:14 Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones.
122Kg 23:15 Even the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin--even that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole also.
122Kg 23:16 Then Josiah looked around, and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the LORD proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things.
122Kg 23:17 The king asked, "What is that tombstone I see?" The men of the city said, "It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it."
122Kg 23:18 "Leave it alone," he said. "Don't let anyone disturb his bones." So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
122Kg 23:19 Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed and defiled all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria that had provoked the LORD to anger.
122Kg 23:20 Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
122Kg 23:21 The king gave this order to all the people£º "Celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant."
122Kg 23:22 Not since the days of the judges who led Israel, nor throughout the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah, had any such Passover been observed.
122Kg 23:23 But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the LORD in Jerusalem.
122Kg 23:24 Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 23:25 Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the LORD as he did--with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses.
122Kg 23:26 Nevertheless, the LORD did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to provoke him to anger.
122Kg 23:27 So the LORD said, "I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said, 'There shall my Name be.'"
122Kg 23:28 As for the other events of Josiah's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 23:29 While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to meet him in battle, but Neco faced him and killed him at Megiddo.
122Kg 23:30 Josiah's servants brought his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father.
122Kg 23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
122Kg 23:32 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his fathers had done.
122Kg 23:33 Pharaoh Neco put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
122Kg 23:34 Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah and changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, and there he died.
122Kg 23:35 Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Neco the silver and gold he demanded. In order to do so, he taxed the land and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land according to their assessments.
122Kg 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother's name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah.
122Kg 23:37 And he did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his fathers had done.
122Kg 24:1 During Jehoiakim's reign, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded the land, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years. But then he changed his mind and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.
122Kg 24:2 The LORD sent Babylonian, Aramean, Moabite and Ammonite raiders against him. He sent them to destroy Judah, in accordance with the word of the LORD proclaimed by his servants the prophets.
122Kg 24:3 Surely these things happened to Judah according to the LORD'S command, in order to remove them from his presence because of the sins of Manasseh and all he had done,
122Kg 24:4 including the shedding of innocent blood. For he had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the LORD was not willing to forgive.
122Kg 24:5 As for the other events of Jehoiakim's reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah?
122Kg 24:6 Jehoiakim rested with his fathers. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.
122Kg 24:7 The king of Egypt did not march out from his own country again, because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory, from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
122Kg 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother's name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan; she was from Jerusalem.
122Kg 24:9 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father had done.
122Kg 24:10 At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem and laid siege to it,
122Kg 24:11 and Nebuchadnezzar himself came up to the city while his officers were besieging it.
122Kg 24:12 Jehoiachin king of Judah, his mother, his attendants, his nobles and his officials all surrendered to him. In the eighth year of the reign of the king of Babylon, he took Jehoiachin prisoner.
122Kg 24:13 As the LORD had declared, Nebuchadnezzar removed all the treasures from the temple of the LORD and from the royal palace, and took away all the gold articles that Solomon king of Israel had made for the temple of the LORD.
122Kg 24:14 He carried into exile all Jerusalem£º all the officers and fighting men, and all the craftsmen and artisans--a total of ten thousand. Only the poorest people of the land were left.
122Kg 24:15 Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin captive to Babylon. He also took from Jerusalem to Babylon the king's mother, his wives, his officials and the leading men of the land.
122Kg 24:16 The king of Babylon also deported to Babylon the entire force of seven thousand fighting men, strong and fit for war, and a thousand craftsmen and artisans.
122Kg 24:17 He made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's uncle, king in his place and changed his name to Zedekiah.
122Kg 24:18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah.
122Kg 24:19 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, just as Jehoiakim had done.
122Kg 24:20 t was because of the LORD'S anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
122Kg 25:1 So in the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. He encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it.
122Kg 25:2 The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
122Kg 25:3 By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat.
122Kg 25:4 Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled at night through the gate between the two walls near the king's garden, though the Babylonians were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,
122Kg 25:5 but the Babylonian army pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered,
122Kg 25:6 and he was captured. He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where sentence was pronounced on him.
122Kg 25:7 They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. Then they put out his eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.
122Kg 25:8 On the seventh day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, an official of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
122Kg 25:9 He set fire to the temple of the LORD, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every important building he burned down.
122Kg 25:10 The whole Babylonian army, under the commander of the imperial guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.
122Kg 25:11 Nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile the people who remained in the city, along with the rest of the populace and those who had gone over to the king of Babylon.
122Kg 25:12 But the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields.
122Kg 25:13 The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the movable stands and the bronze Sea that were at the temple of the LORD and they carried the bronze to Babylon.
122Kg 25:14 They also took away the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service.
122Kg 25:15 The commander of the imperial guard took away the censers and sprinkling bowls--all that were made of pure gold or silver.
122Kg 25:16 The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the movable stands, which Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed.
122Kg 25:17 Each pillar was twenty-seven feet high. The bronze capital on top of one pillar was four and a half feet high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around. The other pillar, with its network, was similar.
122Kg 25:18 The commander of the guard took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers.
122Kg 25:19 Of those still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men and five royal advisers. He also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty of his men who were found in the city.
122Kg 25:20 Nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
122Kg 25:21 There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them executed. So Judah went into captivity, away from her land.
122Kg 25:22 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to be over the people he had left behind in Judah.
122Kg 25:23 When all the army officers and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah--Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, and their men.
122Kg 25:24 Gedaliah took an oath to reassure them and their men. "Do not be afraid of the Babylonian officials," he said. "Settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you."
122Kg 25:25 In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal blood, came with ten men and assassinated Gedaliah and also the men of Judah and the Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah.
122Kg 25:26 At this, all the people from the least to the greatest, together with the army officers, fled to Egypt for fear of the Babylonians.
122Kg 25:27 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the year Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon, he released Jehoiachin from prison on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month.
122Kg 25:28 He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.
122Kg 25:29 So Jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the king's table.
122Kg 25:30 Day by day the king gave Jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived.

131Ch 5:19 They waged war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish and Nodab.
131Ch 5:20 They were helped in fighting them, and God handed the Hagrites and all their allies over to them, because they cried out to him during the battle. He answered their prayers, because they trusted in him.
131Ch 5:21 They seized the livestock of the Hagrites--fifty thousand camels, two hundred fifty thousand sheep and two thousand donkeys. They also took one hundred thousand people captive,
131Ch 5:22 and many others fell slain, because the battle was God's. And they occupied the land until the exile.
131Ch 5:23 The people of the half-tribe of Manasseh were numerous; they settled in the land from Bashan to Baal Hermon, that is, to Senir (Mount Hermon).
131Ch 5:24 These were the heads of their families£º Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah and Jahdiel. They were brave warriors, famous men, and heads of their families.
131Ch 5:25 But they were unfaithful to the God of their fathers and prostituted themselves to the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had destroyed before them.
131Ch 5:26 So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria (that is, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria), who took the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh into exile. He took them to Halah, Habor, Hara and the river of Gozan, where they are to this day.

131Ch 10:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
131Ch 10:2 The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.
131Ch 10:3 The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him.
131Ch 10:4 Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me." But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
131Ch 10:5 When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died.
131Ch 10:6 So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together.
131Ch 10:7 When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.
131Ch 10:8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
131Ch 10:9 They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their people.
131Ch 10:10 They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in the temple of Dagon.
131Ch 10:11 When all the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard of everything the Philistines had done to Saul,
131Ch 10:12 all their valiant men went and took the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones under the great tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.
131Ch 10:13 Saul died because he was unfaithful to the LORD; he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance,
131Ch 10:14 and did not inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.
131Ch 11:1 All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, "We are your own flesh and blood.
131Ch 11:2 In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD your God said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'"
131Ch 11:3 When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the LORD had promised through Samuel.
131Ch 11:4 David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there
131Ch 11:5 said to David, "You will not get in here." Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David.
131Ch 11:6 David had said, "Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief." Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command.
131Ch 11:7 David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David.
131Ch 11:8 He built up the city around it, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city.
131Ch 11:9 And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD Almighty was with him.
131Ch 11:10 These were the chiefs of David's mighty men--they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the LORD had promised--
131Ch 11:11 this is the list of David's mighty men£º Jashobeam, a Hacmonite, was chief of the officers; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.
131Ch 11:12 Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men.
131Ch 11:13 He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines.
131Ch 11:14 But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.
131Ch 11:15 Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
131Ch 11:16 At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
131Ch 11:17 David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"
131Ch 11:18 So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.
131Ch 11:19 "God forbid that I should do this!" he said. "Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?" Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
131Ch 11:20 Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.
131Ch 11:21 He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
131Ch 11:22 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
131Ch 11:23 And he struck down an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver's rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
131Ch 11:24 Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.
131Ch 11:25 He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.

131Ch 12:1 These were the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he was banished from the presence of Saul son of Kish (they were among the warriors who helped him in battle;
131Ch 12:2 they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right-handed or left-handed; they were kinsmen of Saul from the tribe of Benjamin)£º
131Ch 12:3 Ahiezer their chief and Joash the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu the Anathothite,
131Ch 12:4 and Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the Thirty, who was a leader of the Thirty; Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad the Gederathite,

131Ch 12:6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer and Jashobeam the Korahites;
131Ch 12:7 and Joelah and Zebadiah the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
131Ch 12:8 Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were brave warriors, ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear. Their faces were the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles in the mountains.
131Ch 12:9 Ezer was the chief, Obadiah the second in command, Eliab the third,
131Ch 12:10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

131Ch 12:14 These Gadites were army commanders; the least was a match for a hundred, and the greatest for a thousand.
131Ch 12:15 It was they who crossed the Jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks, and they put to flight everyone living in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
131Ch 12:16 Other Benjamites and some men from Judah also came to David in his stronghold.
131Ch 12:17 David went out to meet them and said to them, "If you have come to me in peace, to help me, I am ready to have you unite with me. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free from violence, may the God of our fathers see it and judge you."
131Ch 12:18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, chief of the Thirty, and he said£º "We are yours, O David! We are with you, O son of Jesse! Success, success to you, and success to those who help you, for your God will help you." So David received them and made them leaders of his raiding bands.
131Ch 12:19 Some of the men of Manasseh defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. (He and his men did not help the Philistines because, after consultation, their rulers sent him away. They said, "It will cost us our heads if he deserts to his master Saul.")
131Ch 12:20 When David went to Ziklag, these were the men of Manasseh who defected to him£º Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu and Zillethai, leaders of units of a thousand in Manasseh.
131Ch 12:21 They helped David against raiding bands, for all of them were brave warriors, and they were commanders in his army.
131Ch 12:22 Day after day men came to help David, until he had a great army, like the army of God.
131Ch 12:23 These are the numbers of the men armed for battle who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul's kingdom over to him, as the LORD had said£º
131Ch 12:24 men of Judah, carrying shield and spear--6,800 armed for battle;
131Ch 12:25 men of Simeon, warriors ready for battle--7,100;
131Ch 12:26 men of Levi--4,600,
131Ch 12:27 including Jehoiada, leader of the family of Aaron, with 3,700 men,
131Ch 12:28 and Zadok, a brave young warrior, with 22 officers from his family;
131Ch 12:29 men of Benjamin, Saul's kinsmen--3,000, most of whom had remained loyal to Saul's house until then;
131Ch 12:30 men of Ephraim, brave warriors, famous in their own clans--20,800;
131Ch 12:31 men of half the tribe of Manasseh, designated by name to come and make David king--18,000;
131Ch 12:32 men of Issachar, who understood the times and knew what Israel should do--200 chiefs, with all their relatives under their command;
131Ch 12:33 men of Zebulun, experienced soldiers prepared for battle with every type of weapon, to help David with undivided loyalty--50,000;
131Ch 12:34 men of Naphtali--1,000 officers, together with 37,000 men carrying shields and spears;
131Ch 12:35 men of Dan, ready for battle--28,600;
131Ch 12:36 men of Asher, experienced soldiers prepared for battle--40,000;
131Ch 12:37 and from east of the Jordan, men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, armed with every type of weapon--120,000.
131Ch 12:38 All these were fighting men who volunteered to serve in the ranks. They came to Hebron fully determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of the Israelites were also of one mind to make David king.
131Ch 12:39 The men spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, for their families had supplied provisions for them.
131Ch 12:40 Also, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun and Naphtali came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen. There were plentiful supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, oil, cattle and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.
131Ch 13:1 David conferred with each of his officers, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
131Ch 13:2 He then said to the whole assembly of Israel, "If it seems good to you and if it is the will of the LORD our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers throughout the territories of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their towns and pasturelands, to come and join us.
131Ch 13:3 Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of it during the reign of Saul."
131Ch 13:4 The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the people.
131Ch 13:5 So David assembled all the Israelites, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim.
131Ch 13:6 David and all the Israelites with him went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the LORD, who is enthroned between the cherubim--the ark that is called by the Name.
131Ch 13:7 They moved the ark of God from Abinadab's house on a new cart, with Uzzah and Ahio guiding it.
131Ch 13:8 David and all the Israelites were celebrating with all their might before God, with songs and with harps, lyres, tambourines, cymbals and trumpets.
131Ch 13:9 When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled.
131Ch 13:10 The LORD'S anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God.
131Ch 13:11 Then David was angry because the LORD'S wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.
131Ch 13:12 David was afraid of God that day and asked, "How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?"
131Ch 13:13 He did not take the ark to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
131Ch 13:14 The ark of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house for three months, and the LORD blessed his household and everything he had.
131Ch 14:1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him.
131Ch 14:2 And David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom had been highly exalted for the sake of his people Israel.
131Ch 14:3 In Jerusalem David took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters.
131Ch 14:4 These are the names of the children born to him there£º Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
131Ch 14:5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,
131Ch 14:6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
131Ch 14:7 Elishama, Beeliada and Eliphelet.
131Ch 14:8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went out to meet them.
131Ch 14:9 Now the Philistines had come and raided the Valley of Rephaim;
131Ch 14:10 so David inquired of God£º "Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD answered him, "Go, I will hand them over to you."
131Ch 14:11 So David and his men went up to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, "As waters break out, God has broken out against my enemies by my hand." So that place was called Baal Perazim.
131Ch 14:12 The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, and David gave orders to burn them in the fire.
131Ch 14:13 Once more the Philistines raided the valley;
131Ch 14:14 so David inquired of God again, and God answered him, "Do not go straight up, but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.
131Ch 14:15 As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move out to battle, because that will mean God has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army."
131Ch 14:16 So David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army, all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
131Ch 14:17 So David's fame spread throughout every land, and the LORD made all the nations fear him.
131Ch 15:1 After David had constructed buildings for himself in the City of David, he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
131Ch 15:2 Then David said, "No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the LORD chose them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister before him forever."
131Ch 15:3 David assembled all Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.
131Ch 15:4 He called together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites£º
131Ch 15:5 From the descendants of Kohath, Uriel the leader and 120 relatives;
131Ch 15:6 from the descendants of Merari, Asaiah the leader and 220 relatives;
131Ch 15:7 from the descendants of Gershon, Joel the leader and 130 relatives;
131Ch 15:8 from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the leader and 200 relatives;
131Ch 15:9 from the descendants of Hebron, Eliel the leader and 80 relatives;
131Ch 15:10 from the descendants of Uzziel, Amminadab the leader and 112 relatives.
131Ch 15:11 Then David summoned Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab the Levites.
131Ch 15:12 He said to them, "You are the heads of the Levitical families; you and your fellow Levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.
131Ch 15:13 It was because you, the Levites, did not bring it up the first time that the LORD our God broke out in anger against us. We did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way."
131Ch 15:14 So the priests and Levites consecrated themselves in order to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel.
131Ch 15:15 And the Levites carried the ark of God with the poles on their shoulders, as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the LORD.
131Ch 15:16 David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers to sing joyful songs, accompanied by musical instruments£º lyres, harps and cymbals.
131Ch 15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his brothers, Asaph son of Berekiah; and from their brothers the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah;
131Ch 15:18 and with them their brothers next in rank£º Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
131Ch 15:19 The musicians Heman, Asaph and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals;
131Ch 15:20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah were to play the lyres according to alamoth,
131Ch 15:21 and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel and Azaziah were to play the harps, directing according to sheminith.
131Ch 15:22 Kenaniah the head Levite was in charge of the singing; that was his responsibility because he was skillful at it.
131Ch 15:23 Berekiah and Elkanah were to be doorkeepers for the ark.
131Ch 15:24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer the priests were to blow trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah were also to be doorkeepers for the ark.
131Ch 15:25 So David and the elders of Israel and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD from the house of Obed-Edom, with rejoicing.
131Ch 15:26 Because God had helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed.
131Ch 15:27 Now David was clothed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and as were the singers, and Kenaniah, who was in charge of the singing of the choirs. David also wore a linen ephod.
131Ch 15:28 So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouts, with the sounding of rams' horns and trumpets, and of cymbals, and the playing of lyres and harps.
131Ch 15:29 As the ark of the covenant of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David dancing and celebrating, she despised him in her heart.
131Ch 16:1 They brought the ark of God and set it inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and they presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before God.
131Ch 16:2 After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
131Ch 16:3 Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each Israelite man and woman.
131Ch 16:4 He appointed some of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, to make petition, to give thanks, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel£º
131Ch 16:5 Asaph was the chief, Zechariah second, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel. They were to play the lyres and harps, Asaph was to sound the cymbals,
131Ch 16:6 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
131Ch 16:7 That day David first committed to Asaph and his associates this psalm of thanks to the LORD£º
131Ch 16:8 Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done.
131Ch 16:9 Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.
131Ch 16:10 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
131Ch 16:11 Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.
131Ch 16:12 Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,
131Ch 16:13 O descendants of Israel his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
131Ch 16:14 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
131Ch 16:15 He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,
131Ch 16:16 the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.
131Ch 16:17 He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant£º
131Ch 16:18 "To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."
131Ch 16:19 When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,
131Ch 16:20 they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
131Ch 16:21 He allowed no man to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings£º
131Ch 16:22 "Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."
131Ch 16:23 Sing to the LORD, all the earth; proclaim his salvation day after day.
131Ch 16:24 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.
131Ch 16:25 For great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods.
131Ch 16:26 For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.
131Ch 16:27 Splendor and majesty are before him; strength and joy in his dwelling place.
131Ch 16:28 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength,
131Ch 16:29 ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name. Bring an offering and come before him; worship the LORD in the splendor of his holiness.
131Ch 16:30 Tremble before him, all the earth! The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
131Ch 16:31 Let the heavens rejoice, let the earth be glad; let them say among the nations, "The LORD reigns!"
131Ch 16:32 Let the sea resound, and all that is in it; let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them!
131Ch 16:33 Then the trees of the forest will sing, they will sing for joy before the LORD, for he comes to judge the earth.
131Ch 16:34 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.
131Ch 16:35 Cry out, "Save us, O God our Savior; gather us and deliver us from the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy name, that we may glory in your praise."
131Ch 16:36 Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Then all the people said "Amen" and "Praise the LORD."
131Ch 16:37 David left Asaph and his associates before the ark of the covenant of the LORD to minister there regularly, according to each day's requirements.
131Ch 16:38 He also left Obed-Edom and his sixty-eight associates to minister with them. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and also Hosah, were gatekeepers.
131Ch 16:39 David left Zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the LORD at the high place in Gibeon
131Ch 16:40 to present burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of burnt offering regularly, morning and evening, in accordance with everything written in the Law of the LORD, which he had given Israel.
131Ch 16:41 With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the LORD, "for his love endures forever."
131Ch 16:42 Heman and Jeduthun were responsible for the sounding of the trumpets and cymbals and for the playing of the other instruments for sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were stationed at the gate.
131Ch 16:43 Then all the people left, each for his own home, and David returned home to bless his family.
131Ch 17:1 After David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the LORD is under a tent."
131Ch 17:2 Nathan replied to David, "Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you."
131Ch 17:3 That night the word of God came to Nathan, saying£º
131Ch 17:4 "Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says£º You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in.
131Ch 17:5 I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another.
131Ch 17:6 Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders whom I commanded to shepherd my people, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?" '
131Ch 17:7 "Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says£º I took you from the pasture and from following the flock, to be ruler over my people Israel.
131Ch 17:8 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the earth.
131Ch 17:9 And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning
131Ch 17:10 and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies. "'I declare to you that the LORD will build a house for you£º
131Ch 17:11 When your days are over and you go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
131Ch 17:12 He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.
131Ch 17:13 I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my love away from him, as I took it away from your predecessor.
131Ch 17:14 I will set him over my house and my kingdom forever; his throne will be established forever.'"
131Ch 17:15 Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
131Ch 17:16 Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said£º "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
131Ch 17:17 And as if this were not enough in your sight, O God, you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant. You have looked on me as though I were the most exalted of men, O LORD God.
131Ch 17:18 "What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? For you know your servant,
131Ch 17:19 O LORD. For the sake of your servant and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises.
131Ch 17:20 "There is no one like you, O LORD, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.
131Ch 17:21 And who is like your people Israel--the one nation on earth whose God went out to redeem a people for himself, and to make a name for yourself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?
131Ch 17:22 You made your people Israel your very own forever, and you, O LORD, have become their God.
131Ch 17:23 "And now, LORD, let the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house be established forever. Do as you promised,
131Ch 17:24 so that it will be established and that your name will be great forever. Then men will say, 'The LORD Almighty, the God over Israel, is Israel's God!' And the house of your servant David will be established before you.
131Ch 17:25 "You, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. So your servant has found courage to pray to you.
131Ch 17:26 O LORD, you are God! You have promised these good things to your servant.
131Ch 17:27 Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, O LORD, have blessed it, and it will be blessed forever."
131Ch 18:1 In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Gath and its surrounding villages from the control of the Philistines.
131Ch 18:2 David also defeated the Moabites, and they became subject to him and brought tribute.
131Ch 18:3 Moreover, David fought Hadadezer king of Zobah, as far as Hamath, when he went to establish his control along the Euphrates River.
131Ch 18:4 David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
131Ch 18:5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them.
131Ch 18:6 He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought tribute. The LORD gave David victory everywhere he went.
131Ch 18:7 David took the gold shields carried by the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
131Ch 18:8 From Tebah and Cun, towns that belonged to Hadadezer, David took a great quantity of bronze, which Solomon used to make the bronze Sea, the pillars and various bronze articles.
131Ch 18:9 When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah,
131Ch 18:10 he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and silver and bronze.
131Ch 18:11 King David dedicated these articles to the LORD, as he had done with the silver and gold he had taken from all these nations£º Edom and Moab, the Ammonites and the Philistines, and Amalek.
131Ch 18:12 Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
131Ch 18:13 He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The LORD gave David victory everywhere he went.
131Ch 18:14 David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people.
131Ch 18:15 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
131Ch 18:16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was secretary;
131Ch 18:17 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David's sons were chief officials at the king's side.
131Ch 19:1 In the course of time, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son succeeded him as king.
131Ch 19:2 David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to Hanun in the land of the Ammonites to express sympathy to him,
131Ch 19:3 the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Haven't his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it?"
131Ch 19:4 So Hanun seized David's men, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.
131Ch 19:5 When someone came and told David about the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."
131Ch 19:6 When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram Naharaim, Aram Maacah and Zobah.
131Ch 19:7 They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and charioteers, as well as the king of Maacah with his troops, who came and camped near Medeba, while the Ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle.
131Ch 19:8 On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.
131Ch 19:9 The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city, while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.
131Ch 19:10 Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.
131Ch 19:11 He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother, and they were deployed against the Ammonites.
131Ch 19:12 Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to rescue me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will rescue you.
131Ch 19:13 Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."
131Ch 19:14 Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.
131Ch 19:15 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they too fled before his brother Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.
131Ch 19:16 After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they sent messengers and had Arameans brought from beyond the River, with Shophach the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them.
131Ch 19:17 When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan; he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them. David formed his lines to meet the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him.
131Ch 19:18 But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach the commander of their army.
131Ch 19:19 When the vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the Ammonites anymore.
131Ch 20:1 In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, Joab led out the armed forces. He laid waste the land of the Ammonites and went to Rabbah and besieged it, but David remained in Jerusalem. Joab attacked Rabbah and left it in ruins.
131Ch 20:2 David took the crown from the head of their king--its weight was found to be a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones--and it was placed on David's head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city
131Ch 20:3 and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
131Ch 20:4 In the course of time, war broke out with the Philistines, at Gezer. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaites, and the Philistines were subjugated.
131Ch 20:5 In another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod.
131Ch 20:6 In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot--twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha.
131Ch 20:7 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David's brother, killed him.
131Ch 20:8 These were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.
131Ch 21:1 Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.
131Ch 21:2 So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, "Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are."
131Ch 21:3 But Joab replied, "May the LORD multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord's subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?"
131Ch 21:4 The king's word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem.
131Ch 21:5 Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David£º In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah.
131Ch 21:6 But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king's command was repulsive to him.
131Ch 21:7 This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel.
131Ch 21:8 Then David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."
131Ch 21:9 The LORD said to Gad, David's seer,
131Ch 21:10 "Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says£º I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"
131Ch 21:11 So Gad went to David and said to him, "This is what the LORD says£º 'Take your choice£º
131Ch 21:12 three years of famine, three months of being swept away before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the LORD--days of plague in the land, with the angel of the LORD ravaging every part of Israel.' Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me."
131Ch 21:13 David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."
131Ch 21:14 So the LORD sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead.
131Ch 21:15 And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the LORD saw it and was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
131Ch 21:16 David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown.
131Ch 21:17 David said to God, "Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? O LORD my God, let your hand fall upon me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people."
131Ch 21:18 Then the angel of the LORD ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
131Ch 21:19 So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the LORD.
131Ch 21:20 While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
131Ch 21:21 Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground.
131Ch 21:22 David said to him, "Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price."
131Ch 21:23 Araunah said to David, "Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this."
131Ch 21:24 But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing."
131Ch 21:25 So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels of gold for the site.
131Ch 21:26 David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
131Ch 21:27 Then the LORD spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
131Ch 21:28 At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there.
131Ch 21:29 The tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the desert, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon.
131Ch 21:30 But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
131Ch 22:1 Then David said, "The house of the LORD God is to be here, and also the altar of burnt offering for Israel."
131Ch 22:2 So David gave orders to assemble the aliens living in Israel, and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of God.
131Ch 22:3 He provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings, and more bronze than could be weighed.
131Ch 22:4 He also provided more cedar logs than could be counted, for the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought large numbers of them to David.
131Ch 22:5 David said, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house to be built for the LORD should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations. Therefore I will make preparations for it." So David made extensive preparations before his death.
131Ch 22:6 Then he called for his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the LORD, the God of Israel.
131Ch 22:7 David said to Solomon£º "My son, I had it in my heart to build a house for the Name of the LORD my God.
131Ch 22:8 But this word of the LORD came to me£º 'You have shed much blood and have fought many wars. You are not to build a house for my Name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.
131Ch 22:9 But you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side. His name will be Solomon, and I will grant Israel peace and quiet during his reign.
131Ch 22:10 He is the one who will build a house for my Name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.'
131Ch 22:11 "Now, my son, the LORD be with you, and may you have success and build the house of the LORD your God, as he said you would.
131Ch 22:12 May the LORD give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over Israel, so that you may keep the law of the LORD your God.
131Ch 22:13 Then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the LORD gave Moses for Israel. Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged.
131Ch 22:14 "I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the LORD a hundred thousand talents of gold, a million talents of silver, quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed, and wood and stone. And you may add to them.
131Ch 22:15 You have many workmen£º stonecutters, masons and carpenters, as well as men skilled in every kind of work
131Ch 22:16 in gold and silver, bronze and iron--craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work, and the LORD be with you."
131Ch 22:17 Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon.
131Ch 22:18 He said to them, "Is not the LORD your God with you? And has he not granted you rest on every side? For he has handed the inhabitants of the land over to me, and the land is subject to the LORD and to his people.
131Ch 22:19 Now devote your heart and soul to seeking the LORD your God. Begin to build the sanctuary of the LORD God, so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD and the sacred articles belonging to God into the temple that will be built for the Name of the LORD."
131Ch 23:1 When David was old and full of years, he made his son Solomon king over Israel.
131Ch 23:2 He also gathered together all the leaders of Israel, as well as the priests and Levites.
131Ch 23:3 The Levites thirty years old or more were counted, and the total number of men was thirty-eight thousand.
131Ch 23:4 David said, "Of these, twenty-four thousand are to supervise the work of the temple of the LORD and six thousand are to be officials and judges.
131Ch 23:5 Four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the LORD with the musical instruments I have provided for that purpose."
131Ch 23:6 David divided the Levites into groups corresponding to the sons of Levi£º Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
131Ch 23:7 Belonging to the Gershonites£º Ladan and Shimei.
131Ch 23:8 The sons of Ladan£º Jehiel the first, Zetham and Joel--three in all.
131Ch 23:9 The sons of Shimei£º Shelomoth, Haziel and Haran--three in all. These were the heads of the families of Ladan.
131Ch 23:10 And the sons of Shimei£º Jahath, Ziza, Jeush and Beriah. These were the sons of Shimei--four in all.
131Ch 23:11 Jahath was the first and Ziza the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; so they were counted as one family with one assignment.
131Ch 23:12 The sons of Kohath£º Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel--four in all.
131Ch 23:13 The sons of Amram£º Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart, he and his descendants forever, to consecrate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices before the LORD, to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name forever.
131Ch 23:14 The sons of Moses the man of God were counted as part of the tribe of Levi.
131Ch 23:15 The sons of Moses£º Gershom and Eliezer.
131Ch 23:16 The descendants of Gershom£º Shubael was the first.
131Ch 23:17 The descendants of Eliezer£º Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very numerous.
131Ch 23:18 The sons of Izhar£º Shelomith was the first.
131Ch 23:19 The sons of Hebron£º Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.
131Ch 23:20 The sons of Uzziel£º Micah the first and Isshiah the second.
131Ch 23:21 The sons of Merari£º Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli£º Eleazar and Kish.
131Ch 23:22 Eleazar died without having sons£º he had only daughters. Their cousins, the sons of Kish, married them.
131Ch 23:23 The sons of Mushi£º Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth--three in all.
131Ch 23:24 These were the descendants of Levi by their families--the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually, that is, the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the LORD.
131Ch 23:25 For David had said, "Since the LORD, the God of Israel, has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in Jerusalem forever,
131Ch 23:26 the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service."
131Ch 23:27 According to the last instructions of David, the Levites were counted from those twenty years old or more.
131Ch 23:28 The duty of the Levites was to help Aaron's descendants in the service of the temple of the LORD£º to be in charge of the courtyards, the side rooms, the purification of all sacred things and the performance of other duties at the house of God.
131Ch 23:29 They were in charge of the bread set out on the table, the flour for the grain offerings, the unleavened wafers, the baking and the mixing, and all measurements of quantity and size.
131Ch 23:30 They were also to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD. They were to do the same in the evening
131Ch 23:31 and whenever burnt offerings were presented to the LORD on Sabbaths and at New Moon festivals and at appointed feasts. They were to serve before the LORD regularly in the proper number and in the way prescribed for them.
131Ch 23:32 And so the Levites carried out their responsibilities for the Tent of Meeting, for the Holy Place and, under their brothers the descendants of Aaron, for the service of the temple of the LORD.
131Ch 24:1 These were the divisions of the sons of Aaron£º The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
131Ch 24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons; so Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests.
131Ch 24:3 With the help of Zadok a descendant of Eleazar and Ahimelech a descendant of Ithamar, David separated them into divisions for their appointed order of ministering.
131Ch 24:4 A larger number of leaders were found among Eleazar's descendants than among Ithamar's, and they were divided accordingly£º sixteen heads of families from Eleazar's descendants and eight heads of families from Ithamar's descendants.
131Ch 24:5 They divided them impartially by drawing lots, for there were officials of the sanctuary and officials of God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar.
131Ch 24:6 The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, recorded their names in the presence of the king and of the officials£º Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites--one family being taken from Eleazar and then one from Ithamar.
131Ch 24:7 The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,
131Ch 24:8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,
131Ch 24:9 the fifth to Malkijah, the sixth to Mijamin,
131Ch 24:10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,
131Ch 24:11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,
131Ch 24:12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,
131Ch 24:13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,
131Ch 24:14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,
131Ch 24:15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,
131Ch 24:16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,
131Ch 24:17 the twenty-first to Jakin, the twenty-second to Gamul,
131Ch 24:18 the twenty-third to Delaiah and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.
131Ch 24:19 This was their appointed order of ministering when they entered the temple of the LORD, according to the regulations prescribed for them by their forefather Aaron, as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded him.
131Ch 24:20 As for the rest of the descendants of Levi£º from the sons of Amram£º Shubael; from the sons of Shubael£º Jehdeiah.
131Ch 24:21 As for Rehabiah, from his sons£º Isshiah was the first.
131Ch 24:22 From the Izharites£º Shelomoth; from the sons of Shelomoth£º Jahath.
131Ch 24:23 The sons of Hebron£º Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third and Jekameam the fourth.
131Ch 24:24 The son of Uzziel£º Micah; from the sons of Micah£º Shamir.
131Ch 24:25 The brother of Micah£º Isshiah; from the sons of Isshiah£º Zechariah.
131Ch 24:26 The sons of Merari£º Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah£º Beno.
131Ch 24:27 The sons of Merari£º from Jaaziah£º Beno, Shoham, Zaccur and Ibri.
131Ch 24:28 From Mahli£º Eleazar, who had no sons.
131Ch 24:29 From Kish£º the son of Kish£º Jerahmeel.
131Ch 24:30 And the sons of Mushi£º Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth. These were the Levites, according to their families.
131Ch 24:31 They also cast lots, just as their brothers the descendants of Aaron did, in the presence of King David and of Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of families of the priests and of the Levites. The families of the oldest brother were treated the same as those of the youngest.
131Ch 25:1 David, together with the commanders of the army, set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun for the ministry of prophesying, accompanied by harps, lyres and cymbals. Here is the list of the men who performed this service£º
131Ch 25:2 From the sons of Asaph£º Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah and Asarelah. The sons of Asaph were under the supervision of Asaph, who prophesied under the king's supervision.
131Ch 25:3 As for Jeduthun, from his sons£º Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah and Mattithiah, six in all, under the supervision of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied, using the harp in thanking and praising the LORD.

131Ch 25:5 All these were sons of Heman the king's seer. They were given him through the promises of God to exalt him. God gave Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.
131Ch 25:6 All these men were under the supervision of their fathers for the music of the temple of the LORD, with cymbals, lyres and harps, for the ministry at the house of God. Asaph, Jeduthun and Heman were under the supervision of the king.
131Ch 25:7 Along with their relatives--all of them trained and skilled in music for the LORD--they numbered 288.
131Ch 25:8 Young and old alike, teacher as well as student, cast lots for their duties.

131Ch 28:2 King David rose to his feet and said£º "Listen to me, my brothers and my people. I had it in my heart to build a house as a place of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, for the footstool of our God, and I made plans to build it.
131Ch 28:3 But God said to me, 'You are not to build a house for my Name, because you are a warrior and have shed blood.'
131Ch 28:4 "Yet the LORD, the God of Israel, chose me from my whole family to be king over Israel forever. He chose Judah as leader, and from the house of Judah he chose my family, and from my father's sons he was pleased to make me king over all Israel.
131Ch 28:5 Of all my sons--and the LORD has given me many--he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel.
131Ch 28:6 He said to me£º 'Solomon your son is the one who will build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
131Ch 28:7 I will establish his kingdom forever if he is unswerving in carrying out my commands and laws, as is being done at this time.'
131Ch 28:8 "So now I charge you in the sight of all Israel and of the assembly of the LORD, and in the hearing of our God£º Be careful to follow all the commands of the LORD your God, that you may possess this good land and pass it on as an inheritance to your descendants forever.
131Ch 28:9 "And you, my son Solomon, acknowledge the God of your father, and serve him with wholehearted devotion and with a willing mind, for the LORD searches every heart and understands every motive behind the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will reject you forever.
131Ch 28:10 Consider now, for the LORD has chosen you to build a temple as a sanctuary. Be strong and do the work."
131Ch 28:11 Then David gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico of the temple, its buildings, its storerooms, its upper parts, its inner rooms and the place of atonement.
131Ch 28:12 He gave him the plans of all that the Spirit had put in his mind for the courts of the temple of the LORD and all the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the temple of God and for the treasuries for the dedicated things.
131Ch 28:13 He gave him instructions for the divisions of the priests and Levites, and for all the work of serving in the temple of the LORD, as well as for all the articles to be used in its service.
131Ch 28:14 He designated the weight of gold for all the gold articles to be used in various kinds of service, and the weight of silver for all the silver articles to be used in various kinds of service£º
131Ch 28:15 the weight of gold for the gold lampstands and their lamps, with the weight for each lampstand and its lamps; and the weight of silver for each silver lampstand and its lamps, according to the use of each lampstand;
131Ch 28:16 the weight of gold for each table for consecrated bread; the weight of silver for the silver tables;
131Ch 28:17 the weight of pure gold for the forks, sprinkling bowls and pitchers; the weight of gold for each gold dish; the weight of silver for each silver dish;
131Ch 28:18 and the weight of the refined gold for the altar of incense. He also gave him the plan for the chariot, that is, the cherubim of gold that spread their wings and shelter the ark of the covenant of the LORD.
131Ch 28:19 "All this," David said, "I have in writing from the hand of the LORD upon me, and he gave me understanding in all the details of the plan."
131Ch 28:20 David also said to Solomon his son, "Be strong and courageous, and do the work. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work for the service of the temple of the LORD is finished.
131Ch 28:21 The divisions of the priests and Levites are ready for all the work on the temple of God, and every willing man skilled in any craft will help you in all the work. The officials and all the people will obey your every command."
131Ch 29:1 Then King David said to the whole assembly£º "My son Solomon, the one whom God has chosen, is young and inexperienced. The task is great, because this palatial structure is not for man but for the LORD God.
131Ch 29:2 With all my resources I have provided for the temple of my God--gold for the gold work, silver for the silver, bronze for the bronze, iron for the iron and wood for the wood, as well as onyx for the settings, turquoise, stones of various colors, and all kinds of fine stone and marble--all of these in large quantities.
131Ch 29:3 Besides, in my devotion to the temple of my God I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the temple of my God, over and above everything I have provided for this holy temple£º
131Ch 29:4 three thousand talents of gold (gold of Ophir) and seven thousand talents of refined silver, for the overlaying of the walls of the buildings,
131Ch 29:5 for the gold work and the silver work, and for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now, who is willing to consecrate himself today to the LORD?"
131Ch 29:6 Then the leaders of families, the officers of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's work gave willingly.
131Ch 29:7 They gave toward the work on the temple of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze and a hundred thousand talents of iron.
131Ch 29:8 Any who had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the LORD in the custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.
131Ch 29:9 The people rejoiced at the willing response of their leaders, for they had given freely and wholeheartedly to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly.
131Ch 29:10 David praised the LORD in the presence of the whole assembly, saying, "Praise be to you, O LORD, God of our father Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.
131Ch 29:11 Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the splendor, for everything in heaven and earth is yours. Yours, O LORD, is the kingdom; you are exalted as head over all.
131Ch 29:12 Wealth and honor come from you; you are the ruler of all things. In your hands are strength and power to exalt and give strength to all.
131Ch 29:13 Now, our God, we give you thanks, and praise your glorious name.
131Ch 29:14 "But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? Everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your hand.
131Ch 29:15 We are aliens and strangers in your sight, as were all our forefathers. Our days on earth are like a shadow, without hope.
131Ch 29:16 O LORD our God, as for all this abundance that we have provided for building you a temple for your Holy Name, it comes from your hand, and all of it belongs to you.
131Ch 29:17 I know, my God, that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity. All these things have I given willingly and with honest intent. And now I have seen with joy how willingly your people who are here have given to you.
131Ch 29:18 O LORD, God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Israel, keep this desire in the hearts of your people forever, and keep their hearts loyal to you.
131Ch 29:19 And give my son Solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands, requirements and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which I have provided."
131Ch 29:20 Then David said to the whole assembly, "Praise the LORD your God." So they all praised the LORD, the God of their fathers; they bowed low and fell prostrate before the LORD and the king.
131Ch 29:21 The next day they made sacrifices to the LORD and presented burnt offerings to him£º a thousand bulls, a thousand rams and a thousand male lambs, together with their drink offerings, and other sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
131Ch 29:22 They ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the LORD that day. Then they acknowledged Solomon son of David as king a second time, anointing him before the LORD to be ruler and Zadok to be priest.
131Ch 29:23 So Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of his father David. He prospered and all Israel obeyed him.
131Ch 29:24 All the officers and mighty men, as well as all of King David's sons, pledged their submission to King Solomon.
131Ch 29:25 The LORD highly exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him royal splendor such as no king over Israel ever had before.
131Ch 29:26 David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.
131Ch 29:27 He ruled over Israel forty years--seven in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
131Ch 29:28 He died at a good old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth and honor. His son Solomon succeeded him as king.
131Ch 29:29 As for the events of King David's reign, from beginning to end, they are written in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet and the records of Gad the seer,
131Ch 29:30 together with the details of his reign and power, and the circumstances that surrounded him and Israel and the kingdoms of all the other lands.
14
142Ch 1:1 Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.
142Ch 1:2 Then Solomon spoke to all Israel--to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families--
142Ch 1:3 and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God's Tent of Meeting was there, which Moses the LORD'S servant had made in the desert.
142Ch 1:4 Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
142Ch 1:5 But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the LORD; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there.
142Ch 1:6 Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it.
142Ch 1:7 That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask for whatever you want me to give you."
142Ch 1:8 Solomon answered God, "You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place.
142Ch 1:9 Now, LORD God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth.
142Ch 1:10 Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?"
142Ch 1:11 God said to Solomon, "Since this is your heart's desire and you have not asked for wealth, riches or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king,
142Ch 1:12 therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, riches and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have."
142Ch 1:13 Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting. And he reigned over Israel.
142Ch 1:14 Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
142Ch 1:15 The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.
142Ch 1:16 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue--the royal merchants purchased them from Kue.
142Ch 1:17 They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty. They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans.
142Ch 2:1 Solomon gave orders to build a temple for the Name of the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
142Ch 2:2 He conscripted seventy thousand men as carriers and eighty thousand as stonecutters in the hills and thirty-six hundred as foremen over them.
142Ch 2:3 Solomon sent this message to Hiram king of Tyre£º "Send me cedar logs as you did for my father David when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in.
142Ch 2:4 Now I am about to build a temple for the Name of the LORD my God and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him, for setting out the consecrated bread regularly, and for making burnt offerings every morning and evening and on Sabbaths and New Moons and at the appointed feasts of the LORD our God. This is a lasting ordinance for Israel.
142Ch 2:5 "The temple I am going to build will be great, because our God is greater than all other gods.
142Ch 2:6 But who is able to build a temple for him, since the heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain him? Who then am I to build a temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices before him?
142Ch 2:7 "Send me, therefore, a man skilled to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, and in purple, crimson and blue yarn, and experienced in the art of engraving, to work in Judah and Jerusalem with my skilled craftsmen, whom my father David provided.
142Ch 2:8 "Send me also cedar, pine and algum logs from Lebanon, for I know that your men are skilled in cutting timber there. My men will work with yours
142Ch 2:9 to provide me with plenty of lumber, because the temple I build must be large and magnificent.
142Ch 2:10 I will give your servants, the woodsmen who cut the timber, twenty thousand cors of ground wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of olive oil."
142Ch 2:11 Hiram king of Tyre replied by letter to Solomon£º "Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you their king."
142Ch 2:12 And Hiram added£º "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who made heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, endowed with intelligence and discernment, who will build a temple for the LORD and a palace for himself.
142Ch 2:13 "I am sending you Huram-Abi, a man of great skill,
142Ch 2:14 whose mother was from Dan and whose father was from Tyre. He is trained to work in gold and silver, bronze and iron, stone and wood, and with purple and blue and crimson yarn and fine linen. He is experienced in all kinds of engraving and can execute any design given to him. He will work with your craftsmen and with those of my lord, David your father.
142Ch 2:15 "Now let my lord send his servants the wheat and barley and the olive oil and wine he promised,
142Ch 2:16 and we will cut all the logs from Lebanon that you need and will float them in rafts by sea down to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem."
142Ch 2:17 Solomon took a census of all the aliens who were in Israel, after the census his father David had taken; and they were found to be 153,600.
142Ch 2:18 He assigned 70,000 of them to be carriers and 80,000 to be stonecutters in the hills, with 3,600 foremen over them to keep the people working.
142Ch 3:1 Then Solomon began to build the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to his father David. It was on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, the place provided by David.
142Ch 3:2 He began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign.
142Ch 3:3 The foundation Solomon laid for building the temple of God was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide (using the cubit of the old standard).
142Ch 3:4 The portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long across the width of the building and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold.
142Ch 3:5 He paneled the main hall with pine and covered it with fine gold and decorated it with palm tree and chain designs.
142Ch 3:6 He adorned the temple with precious stones. And the gold he used was gold of Parvaim.
142Ch 3:7 He overlaid the ceiling beams, doorframes, walls and doors of the temple with gold, and he carved cherubim on the walls.
142Ch 3:8 He built the Most Holy Place, its length corresponding to the width of the temple--twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. He overlaid the inside with six hundred talents of fine gold.
142Ch 3:9 The gold nails weighed fifty shekels. He also overlaid the upper parts with gold.
142Ch 3:10 In the Most Holy Place he made a pair of sculptured cherubim and overlaid them with gold.
142Ch 3:11 The total wingspan of the cherubim was twenty cubits. One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and touched the temple wall, while its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the other cherub.
142Ch 3:12 Similarly one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the other temple wall, and its other wing, also five cubits long, touched the wing of the first cherub.
142Ch 3:13 The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits. They stood on their feet, facing the main hall.
142Ch 3:14 He made the curtain of blue, purple and crimson yarn and fine linen, with cherubim worked into it.
142Ch 3:15 In the front of the temple he made two pillars, which together were thirty-five cubits long, each with a capital on top measuring five cubits.
142Ch 3:16 He made interwoven chains and put them on top of the pillars. He also made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains.
142Ch 3:17 He erected the pillars in the front of the temple, one to the south and one to the north. The one to the south he named Jakin and the one to the north Boaz.
142Ch 4:1 He made a bronze altar twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.
142Ch 4:2 He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it.
142Ch 4:3 Below the rim, figures of bulls encircled it--ten to a cubit. The bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea.
142Ch 4:4 The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center.
142Ch 4:5 It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held three thousand baths.
142Ch 4:6 He then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north. In them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed, but the Sea was to be used by the priests for washing.
142Ch 4:7 He made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.
142Ch 4:8 He made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. He also made a hundred gold sprinkling bowls.
142Ch 4:9 He made the courtyard of the priests, and the large court and the doors for the court, and overlaid the doors with bronze.
142Ch 4:10 He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner.
142Ch 4:11 He also made the pots and shovels and sprinkling bowls. So Huram finished the work he had undertaken for King Solomon in the temple of God£º
142Ch 4:12 the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two sets of network decorating the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars;
142Ch 4:13 the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network (two rows of pomegranates for each network, decorating the bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars);
142Ch 4:14 the stands with their basins;
142Ch 4:15 the Sea and the twelve bulls under it;
142Ch 4:16 the pots, shovels, meat forks and all related articles. All the objects that Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for the temple of the LORD were of polished bronze.
142Ch 4:17 The king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the Jordan between Succoth and Zarethan.
142Ch 4:18 All these things that Solomon made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze was not determined.
142Ch 4:19 Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in God's temple£º the golden altar; the tables on which was the bread of the Presence;
142Ch 4:20 the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps, to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed;
142Ch 4:21 the gold floral work and lamps and tongs (they were solid gold);
142Ch 4:22 the pure gold wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, dishes and censers; and the gold doors of the temple£º the inner doors to the Most Holy Place and the doors of the main hall.
142Ch 5:1 When all the work Solomon had done for the temple of the LORD was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated--the silver and gold and all the furnishings--and he placed them in the treasuries of God's temple.
142Ch 5:2 Then Solomon summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the LORD'S covenant from Zion, the City of David.
142Ch 5:3 And all the men of Israel came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month.
142Ch 5:4 When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark,
142Ch 5:5 and they brought up the ark and the Tent of Meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests, who were Levites, carried them up;
142Ch 5:6 and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted.
142Ch 5:7 The priests then brought the ark of the LORD'S covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim.
142Ch 5:8 The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles.
142Ch 5:9 These poles were so long that their ends, extending from the ark, could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today.
142Ch 5:10 There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.
142Ch 5:11 The priests then withdrew from the Holy Place. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions.
142Ch 5:12 All the Levites who were musicians--Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun and their sons and relatives--stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets.
142Ch 5:13 The trumpeters and singers joined in unison, as with one voice, to give praise and thanks to the LORD. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals and other instruments, they raised their voices in praise to the LORD and sang£º "He is good; his love endures forever." Then the temple of the LORD was filled with a cloud,
142Ch 5:14 and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the temple of God.
142Ch 6:1 Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud;
142Ch 6:2 I have built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever."
142Ch 6:3 While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them.
142Ch 6:4 Then he said£º "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father David. For he said,
142Ch 6:5 'Since the day I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel to have a temple built for my Name to be there, nor have I chosen anyone to be the leader over my people Israel.
142Ch 6:6 But now I have chosen Jerusalem for my Name to be there, and I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.'
142Ch 6:7 "My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 6:8 But the LORD said to my father David, 'Because it was in your heart to build a temple for my Name, you did well to have this in your heart.
142Ch 6:9 Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, who is your own flesh and blood--he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.'
142Ch 6:10 "The LORD has kept the promise he made. I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 6:11 There I have placed the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with the people of Israel."
142Ch 6:12 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands.
142Ch 6:13 Now he had made a bronze platform, five cubits long, five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had placed it in the center of the outer court. He stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven.
142Ch 6:14 He said£º "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven or on earth--you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way.
142Ch 6:15 You have kept your promise to your servant David my father; with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it--as it is today.
142Ch 6:16 "Now LORD, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father the promises you made to him when you said, 'You shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons are careful in all they do to walk before me according to my law, as you have done.'
142Ch 6:17 And now, O LORD, God of Israel, let your word that you promised your servant David come true.
142Ch 6:18 "But will God really dwell on earth with men? The heavens, even the highest heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!
142Ch 6:19 Yet give attention to your servant's prayer and his plea for mercy, O LORD my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence.
142Ch 6:20 May your eyes be open toward this temple day and night, this place of which you said you would put your Name there. May you hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place.
142Ch 6:21 Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.
142Ch 6:22 "When a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple,
142Ch 6:23 then hear from heaven and act. Judge between your servants, repaying the guilty by bringing down on his own head what he has done. Declare the innocent not guilty and so establish his innocence.
142Ch 6:24 "When your people Israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you and when they turn back and confess your name, praying and making supplication before you in this temple,
142Ch 6:25 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their fathers.
142Ch 6:26 "When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and when they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them,
142Ch 6:27 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the right way to live, and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance.
142Ch 6:28 "When famine or plague comes to the land, or blight or mildew, locusts or grasshoppers, or when enemies besiege them in any of their cities, whatever disaster or disease may come,
142Ch 6:29 and when a prayer or plea is made by any of your people Israel--each one aware of his afflictions and pains, and spreading out his hands toward this temple--
142Ch 6:30 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place. Forgive, and deal with each man according to all he does, since you know his heart (for you alone know the hearts of men),
142Ch 6:31 so that they will fear you and walk in your ways all the time they live in the land you gave our fathers.
142Ch 6:32 "As for the foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm--when he comes and prays toward this temple,
142Ch 6:33 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I have built bears your Name.
142Ch 6:34 "When your people go to war against their enemies, wherever you send them, and when they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the temple I have built for your Name,
142Ch 6:35 then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea, and uphold their cause.
142Ch 6:36 "When they sin against you--for there is no one who does not sin--and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy, who takes them captive to a land far away or near;
142Ch 6:37 and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity and say, 'We have sinned, we have done wrong and acted wickedly';
142Ch 6:38 and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken, and pray toward the land you gave their fathers, toward the city you have chosen and toward the temple I have built for your Name;
142Ch 6:39 then from heaven, your dwelling place, hear their prayer and their pleas, and uphold their cause. And forgive your people, who have sinned against you.
142Ch 6:40 "Now, my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
142Ch 6:41 "Now arise, O LORD God, and come to your resting place, you and the ark of your might. May your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation, may your saints rejoice in your goodness.
142Ch 6:42 O LORD God, do not reject your anointed one. Remember the great love promised to David your servant."
142Ch 7:1 When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the LORD filled the temple.
142Ch 7:2 The priests could not enter the temple of the LORD because the glory of the LORD filled it.
142Ch 7:3 When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the LORD above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the LORD, saying, "He is good; his love endures forever."
142Ch 7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.
142Ch 7:5 And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God.
142Ch 7:6 The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the LORD'S musical instruments, which King David had made for praising the LORD and which were used when he gave thanks, saying, "His love endures forever." Opposite the Levites, the priests blew their trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing.
142Ch 7:7 Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the LORD, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat portions.
142Ch 7:8 So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him--a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt.
142Ch 7:9 On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more.
142Ch 7:10 On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the LORD had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel.
142Ch 7:11 When Solomon had finished the temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the LORD and in his own palace,
142Ch 7:12 the LORD appeared to him at night and said£º "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices.
142Ch 7:13 "When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people,
142Ch 7:14 if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.
142Ch 7:15 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place.
142Ch 7:16 I have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my Name may be there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there.
142Ch 7:17 "As for you, if you walk before me as David your father did, and do all I command, and observe my decrees and laws,
142Ch 7:18 I will establish your royal throne, as I covenanted with David your father when I said, 'You shall never fail to have a man to rule over Israel.'
142Ch 7:19 "But if you turn away and forsake the decrees and commands I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them,
142Ch 7:20 then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them, and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. I will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples.
142Ch 7:21 And though this temple is now so imposing, all who pass by will be appalled and say, 'Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land and to this temple?'
142Ch 7:22 People will answer, 'Because they have forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them--that is why he brought all this disaster on them.'"
142Ch 8:1 At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built the temple of the LORD and his own palace,
142Ch 8:2 Solomon rebuilt the villages that Hiram had given him, and settled Israelites in them.
142Ch 8:3 Solomon then went to Hamath Zobah and captured it.
142Ch 8:4 He also built up Tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in Hamath.
142Ch 8:5 He rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon as fortified cities, with walls and with gates and bars,
142Ch 8:6 as well as Baalath and all his store cities, and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses--whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled.
142Ch 8:7 All the people left from the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites),
142Ch 8:8 that is, their descendants remaining in the land, whom the Israelites had not destroyed--these Solomon conscripted for his slave labor force, as it is to this day.
142Ch 8:9 But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites for his work; they were his fighting men, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and charioteers.
142Ch 8:10 They were also King Solomon's chief officials--two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men.
142Ch 8:11 Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the City of David to the palace he had built for her, for he said, "My wife must not live in the palace of David king of Israel, because the places the ark of the LORD has entered are holy."
142Ch 8:12 On the altar of the LORD that he had built in front of the portico, Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the LORD,
142Ch 8:13 according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by Moses for Sabbaths, New Moons and the three annual feasts--the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles.
142Ch 8:14 In keeping with the ordinance of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties, and the Levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each day's requirement. He also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates, because this was what David the man of God had ordered.
142Ch 8:15 They did not deviate from the king's commands to the priests or to the Levites in any matter, including that of the treasuries.
142Ch 8:16 All Solomon's work was carried out, from the day the foundation of the temple of the LORD was laid until its completion. So the temple of the LORD was finished.
142Ch 8:17 Then Solomon went to Ezion Geber and Elath on the coast of Edom.
142Ch 8:18 And Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own officers, men who knew the sea. These, with Solomon's men, sailed to Ophir and brought back four hundred and fifty talents of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon.
142Ch 9:1 When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. Arriving with a very great caravan--with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones--she came to Solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind.
142Ch 9:2 Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her.
142Ch 9:3 When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, as well as the palace he had built,
142Ch 9:4 the food on his table, the seating of his officials, the attending servants in their robes, the cupbearers in their robes and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the LORD, she was overwhelmed.
142Ch 9:5 She said to the king, "The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true.
142Ch 9:6 But I did not believe what they said until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me; you have far exceeded the report I heard.
142Ch 9:7 How happy your men must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom!
142Ch 9:8 Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king to rule for the LORD your God. Because of the love of your God for Israel and his desire to uphold them forever, he has made you king over them, to maintain justice and righteousness."
142Ch 9:9 Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
142Ch 9:10 (The men of Hiram and the men of Solomon brought gold from Ophir; they also brought algumwood and precious stones.
142Ch 9:11 The king used the algumwood to make steps for the temple of the LORD and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. Nothing like them had ever been seen in Judah.)
142Ch 9:12 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for; he gave her more than she had brought to him. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country.
142Ch 9:13 The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,
142Ch 9:14 not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders. Also all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
142Ch 9:15 King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred bekas of hammered gold went into each shield.
142Ch 9:16 He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three hundred bekas of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
142Ch 9:17 Then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with pure gold.
142Ch 9:18 The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them.
142Ch 9:19 Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom.
142Ch 9:20 All King Solomon's goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon's day.
142Ch 9:21 The king had a fleet of trading ships manned by Hiram's men. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons.
142Ch 9:22 King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth.
142Ch 9:23 All the kings of the earth sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart.
142Ch 9:24 Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift--articles of silver and gold, and robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules.
142Ch 9:25 Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horses, which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.
142Ch 9:26 He ruled over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.
142Ch 9:27 The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills.
142Ch 9:28 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from all other countries.
142Ch 9:29 As for the other events of Solomon's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?
142Ch 9:30 Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
142Ch 9:31 Then he rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 10:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all the Israelites had gone there to make him king.
142Ch 10:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt.
142Ch 10:3 So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him£º
142Ch 10:4 "Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you."
142Ch 10:5 Rehoboam answered, "Come back to me in three days." So the people went away.
142Ch 10:6 Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. "How would you advise me to answer these people?" he asked.
142Ch 10:7 They replied, "If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants."
142Ch 10:8 But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.
142Ch 10:9 He asked them, "What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, 'Lighten the yoke your father put on us'?"
142Ch 10:10 The young men who had grown up with him replied, "Tell the people who have said to you, 'Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter'--tell them, 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist.
142Ch 10:11 My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.'"
142Ch 10:12 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, "Come back to me in three days."
142Ch 10:13 The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders,
142Ch 10:14 he followed the advice of the young men and said, "My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions."
142Ch 10:15 So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the LORD had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite.
142Ch 10:16 When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king£º "What share do we have in David, what part in Jesse's son? To your tents, O Israel! Look after your own house, O David!" So all the Israelites went home.
142Ch 10:17 But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them.
142Ch 10:18 King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram, who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem.
142Ch 10:19 So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.
142Ch 11:1 When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mustered the house of Judah and Benjamin--a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men--to make war against Israel and to regain the kingdom for Rehoboam.
142Ch 11:2 But this word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God£º
142Ch 11:3 "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and to all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin,
142Ch 11:4 'This is what the LORD says£º Do not go up to fight against your brothers. Go home, every one of you, for this is my doing.'" So they obeyed the words of the LORD and turned back from marching against Jeroboam.
142Ch 11:5 Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built up towns for defense in Judah£º
142Ch 11:6 Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
142Ch 11:7 Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam,
142Ch 11:8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
142Ch 11:9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
142Ch 11:10 Zorah, Aijalon and Hebron. These were fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.
142Ch 11:11 He strengthened their defenses and put commanders in them, with supplies of food, olive oil and wine.
142Ch 11:12 He put shields and spears in all the cities, and made them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his.
142Ch 11:13 The priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel sided with him.
142Ch 11:14 The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property, and came to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the LORD.
142Ch 11:15 And he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made.
142Ch 11:16 Those from every tribe of Israel who set their hearts on seeking the LORD, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
142Ch 11:17 They strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon three years, walking in the ways of David and Solomon during this time.
142Ch 11:18 Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse's son Eliab.
142Ch 11:19 She bore him sons£º Jeush, Shemariah and Zaham.
142Ch 11:20 Then he married Maacah daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza and Shelomith.
142Ch 11:21 Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
142Ch 11:22 Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah to be the chief prince among his brothers, in order to make him king.
142Ch 11:23 He acted wisely, dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and took many wives for them.
142Ch 12:1 After Rehoboam's position as king was established and he had become strong, he and all Israel with him abandoned the law of the LORD.
142Ch 12:2 Because they had been unfaithful to the LORD, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam.
142Ch 12:3 With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites and Cushites that came with him from Egypt,
142Ch 12:4 he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
142Ch 12:5 Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, "This is what the LORD says, 'You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.'"
142Ch 12:6 The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is just."
142Ch 12:7 When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, this word of the LORD came to Shemaiah£º "Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak.
142Ch 12:8 They will, however, become subject to him, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands."
142Ch 12:9 When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the LORD and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made.
142Ch 12:10 So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace.
142Ch 12:11 Whenever the king went to the LORD'S temple, the guards went with him, bearing the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom.
142Ch 12:12 Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the LORD'S anger turned from him, and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed, there was some good in Judah.
142Ch 12:13 King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother's name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite.
142Ch 12:14 He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the LORD.
142Ch 12:15 As for the events of Rehoboam's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
142Ch 12:16 Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 13:1 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah,
142Ch 13:2 and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother's name was Maacah, a daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
142Ch 13:3 Abijah went into battle with a force of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops.
142Ch 13:4 Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, "Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me!
142Ch 13:5 Don't you know that the LORD, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt?
142Ch 13:6 Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master.
142Ch 13:7 Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them.
142Ch 13:8 "And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the LORD, which is in the hands of David's descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.
142Ch 13:9 But didn't you drive out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods.
142Ch 13:10 "As for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the LORD are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them.
142Ch 13:11 Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the LORD our God. But you have forsaken him.
142Ch 13:12 God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. Men of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed."
142Ch 13:13 Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them.
142Ch 13:14 Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the LORD. The priests blew their trumpets
142Ch 13:15 and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
142Ch 13:16 The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands.
142Ch 13:17 Abijah and his men inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel's able men.
142Ch 13:18 The men of Israel were subdued on that occasion, and the men of Judah were victorious because they relied on the LORD, the God of their fathers.
142Ch 13:19 Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages.
142Ch 13:20 Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the LORD struck him down and he died.
142Ch 13:21 But Abijah grew in strength. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
142Ch 13:22 The other events of Abijah's reign, what he did and what he said, are written in the annotations of the prophet Iddo.
142Ch 14:1 And Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. Asa his son succeeded him as king, and in his days the country was at peace for ten years.
142Ch 14:2 Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God.
142Ch 14:3 He removed the foreign altars and the high places, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles.
142Ch 14:4 He commanded Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, and to obey his laws and commands.
142Ch 14:5 He removed the high places and incense altars in every town in Judah, and the kingdom was at peace under him.
142Ch 14:6 He built up the fortified cities of Judah, since the land was at peace. No one was at war with him during those years, for the LORD gave him rest.
142Ch 14:7 "Let us build up these towns," he said to Judah, "and put walls around them, with towers, gates and bars. The land is still ours, because we have sought the LORD our God; we sought him and he has given us rest on every side." So they built and prospered.
142Ch 14:8 Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah, equipped with large shields and with spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand from Benjamin, armed with small shields and with bows. All these were brave fighting men.
142Ch 14:9 Zerah the Cushite marched out against them with a vast army and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah.
142Ch 14:10 Asa went out to meet him, and they took up battle positions in the Valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.
142Ch 14:11 Then Asa called to the LORD his God and said, "LORD, there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty. Help us, O LORD our God, for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this vast army. O LORD, you are our God; do not let man prevail against you."
142Ch 14:12 The LORD struck down the Cushites before Asa and Judah. The Cushites fled,
142Ch 14:13 and Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar. Such a great number of Cushites fell that they could not recover; they were crushed before the LORD and his forces. The men of Judah carried off a large amount of plunder.
142Ch 14:14 They destroyed all the villages around Gerar, for the terror of the LORD had fallen upon them. They plundered all these villages, since there was much booty there.
142Ch 14:15 They also attacked the camps of the herdsmen and carried off droves of sheep and goats and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
142Ch 15:1 The Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded.
142Ch 15:2 He went out to meet Asa and said to him, "Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you when you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but if you forsake him, he will forsake you.
142Ch 15:3 For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a priest to teach and without the law.
142Ch 15:4 But in their distress they turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him, and he was found by them.
142Ch 15:5 In those days it was not safe to travel about, for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil.
142Ch 15:6 One nation was being crushed by another and one city by another, because God was troubling them with every kind of distress.
142Ch 15:7 But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded."
142Ch 15:8 When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage. He removed the detestable idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim. He repaired the altar of the LORD that was in front of the portico of the LORD'S temple.
142Ch 15:9 Then he assembled all Judah and Benjamin and the people from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon who had settled among them, for large numbers had come over to him from Israel when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
142Ch 15:10 They assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa's reign.
142Ch 15:11 At that time they sacrificed to the LORD seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back.
142Ch 15:12 They entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul.
142Ch 15:13 All who would not seek the LORD, the God of Israel, were to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.
142Ch 15:14 They took an oath to the LORD with loud acclamation, with shouting and with trumpets and horns.
142Ch 15:15 All Judah rejoiced about the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly. They sought God eagerly, and he was found by them. So the LORD gave them rest on every side.
142Ch 15:16 King Asa also deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive Asherah pole. Asa cut the pole down, broke it up and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
142Ch 15:17 Although he did not remove the high places from Israel, Asa's heart was fully committed to the LORD all his life.
142Ch 15:18 He brought into the temple of God the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated.
142Ch 15:19 There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.
142Ch 16:1 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah.
142Ch 16:2 Asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the LORD'S temple and of his own palace and sent it to Ben-Hadad king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus.
142Ch 16:3 "Let there be a treaty between me and you," he said, "as there was between my father and your father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will withdraw from me."
142Ch 16:4 Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim and all the store cities of Naphtali.
142Ch 16:5 When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and abandoned his work.
142Ch 16:6 Then King Asa brought all the men of Judah, and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using. With them he built up Geba and Mizpah.
142Ch 16:7 At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him£º "Because you relied on the king of Aram and not on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.
142Ch 16:8 Were not the Cushites and Libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen? Yet when you relied on the LORD, he delivered them into your hand.
142Ch 16:9 For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. You have done a foolish thing, and from now on you will be at war."
142Ch 16:10 Asa was angry with the seer because of this; he was so enraged that he put him in prison. At the same time Asa brutally oppressed some of the people.
142Ch 16:11 The events of Asa's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 16:12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet. Though his disease was severe, even in his illness he did not seek help from the LORD, but only from the physicians.
142Ch 16:13 Then in the forty-first year of his reign Asa died and rested with his fathers.
142Ch 16:14 They buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the City of David. They laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes, and they made a huge fire in his honor.
142Ch 17:1 Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against Israel.
142Ch 17:2 He stationed troops in all the fortified cities of Judah and put garrisons in Judah and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
142Ch 17:3 The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because in his early years he walked in the ways his father David had followed. He did not consult the Baals
142Ch 17:4 but sought the God of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of Israel.
142Ch 17:5 The LORD established the kingdom under his control; and all Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so that he had great wealth and honor.
142Ch 17:6 His heart was devoted to the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and the Asherah poles from Judah.
142Ch 17:7 In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel and Micaiah to teach in the towns of Judah.
142Ch 17:8 With them were certain Levites--Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah and Tob-Adonijah--and the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
142Ch 17:9 They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD; they went around to all the towns of Judah and taught the people.
142Ch 17:10 The fear of the LORD fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not make war with Jehoshaphat.
142Ch 17:11 Some Philistines brought Jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought him flocks£º seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats.
142Ch 17:12 Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful; he built forts and store cities in Judah
142Ch 17:13 and had large supplies in the towns of Judah. He also kept experienced fighting men in Jerusalem.
142Ch 17:14 Their enrollment by families was as follows£º From Judah, commanders of units of 1,000£º Adnah the commander, with 300,000 fighting men;
142Ch 17:15 next, Jehohanan the commander, with 280,000;
142Ch 17:16 next, Amasiah son of Zicri, who volunteered himself for the service of the LORD, with 200,000.
142Ch 17:17 From Benjamin£º Eliada, a valiant soldier, with 200,000 men armed with bows and shields;
142Ch 17:18 next, Jehozabad, with 180,000 men armed for battle.
142Ch 17:19 These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
142Ch 18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage.
142Ch 18:2 Some years later he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead.
142Ch 18:3 Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, "Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied, "I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war."
142Ch 18:4 But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, "First seek the counsel of the LORD."
142Ch 18:5 So the king of Israel brought together the prophets--four hundred men--and asked them, "Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Go," they answered, "for God will give it into the king's hand."
142Ch 18:6 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not a prophet of the LORD here whom we can inquire of?"
142Ch 18:7 The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, "There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the LORD, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah." "The king should not say that," Jehoshaphat replied.
142Ch 18:8 So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once."
142Ch 18:9 Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance to the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.
142Ch 18:10 Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, "This is what the LORD says£º 'With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.'"
142Ch 18:11 All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. "Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious," they said, "for the LORD will give it into the king's hand."
142Ch 18:12 The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, "Look, as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably."
142Ch 18:13 But Micaiah said, "As surely as the LORD lives, I can tell him only what my God says."
142Ch 18:14 When he arrived, the king asked him, "Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I refrain?" "Attack and be victorious," he answered, "for they will be given into your hand."
142Ch 18:15 The king said to him, "How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"
142Ch 18:16 Then Micaiah answered, "I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the LORD said, 'These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.'"
142Ch 18:17 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?"
142Ch 18:18 Micaiah continued, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD£º I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing on his right and on his left.
142Ch 18:19 And the LORD said, 'Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?' "One suggested this, and another that.
142Ch 18:20 Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the LORD and said, 'I will entice him.' "'By what means?' the LORD asked.
142Ch 18:21 "'I will go and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,' he said. "'You will succeed in enticing him,' said the LORD. 'Go and do it.'
142Ch 18:22 "So now the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The LORD has decreed disaster for you."
142Ch 18:23 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. "Which way did the spirit from the LORD go when he went from me to speak to you?" he asked.
142Ch 18:24 Micaiah replied, "You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room."
142Ch 18:25 The king of Israel then ordered, "Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king's son,
142Ch 18:26 and say, 'This is what the king says£º Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.'"
142Ch 18:27 Micaiah declared, "If you ever return safely, the LORD has not spoken through me." Then he added, "Mark my words, all you people!"
142Ch 18:28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead.
142Ch 18:29 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.
142Ch 18:30 Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, "Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel."
142Ch 18:31 When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, "This is the king of Israel." So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him. God drew them away from him,
142Ch 18:32 for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.
142Ch 18:33 But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the sections of his armor. The king told the chariot driver, "Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I've been wounded."
142Ch 18:34 All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset he died.
142Ch 19:1 When Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem,
142Ch 19:2 Jehu the seer, the son of Hanani, went out to meet him and said to the king, "Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD? Because of this, the wrath of the LORD is upon you.
142Ch 19:3 There is, however, some good in you, for you have rid the land of the Asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking God."
142Ch 19:4 Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and he went out again among the people from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim and turned them back to the LORD, the God of their fathers.
142Ch 19:5 He appointed judges in the land, in each of the fortified cities of Judah.
142Ch 19:6 He told them, "Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for man but for the LORD, who is with you whenever you give a verdict.
142Ch 19:7 Now let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Judge carefully, for with the LORD our God there is no injustice or partiality or bribery."
142Ch 19:8 In Jerusalem also, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests and heads of Israelite families to administer the law of the LORD and to settle disputes. And they lived in Jerusalem.
142Ch 19:9 He gave them these orders£º "You must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the LORD.
142Ch 19:10 In every case that comes before you from your fellow countrymen who live in the cities--whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law, commands, decrees or ordinances--you are to warn them not to sin against the LORD; otherwise his wrath will come on you and your brothers. Do this, and you will not sin.
142Ch 19:11 "Amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the LORD, and Zebadiah son of Ishmael, the leader of the tribe of Judah, will be over you in any matter concerning the king, and the Levites will serve as officials before you. Act with courage, and may the LORD be with those who do well."
142Ch 20:1 After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the Meunites came to make war on Jehoshaphat.
142Ch 20:2 Some men came and told Jehoshaphat, "A vast army is coming against you from Edom, from the other side of the Sea. It is already in Hazazon Tamar" (that is, En Gedi).
142Ch 20:3 Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the LORD, and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah.
142Ch 20:4 The people of Judah came together to seek help from the LORD; indeed, they came from every town in Judah to seek him.
142Ch 20:5 Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the LORD in the front of the new courtyard
142Ch 20:6 and said£º "O LORD, God of our fathers, are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you.
142Ch 20:7 O our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend?
142Ch 20:8 They have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your Name, saying,
142Ch 20:9 'If calamity comes upon us, whether the sword of judgment, or plague or famine, we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your Name and will cry out to you in our distress, and you will hear us and save us.'
142Ch 20:10 "But now here are men from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them.
142Ch 20:11 See how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance.
142Ch 20:12 O our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon you."
142Ch 20:13 All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the LORD.
142Ch 20:14 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly.
142Ch 20:15 He said£º "Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem! This is what the LORD says to you£º 'Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God's.
142Ch 20:16 Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel.
142Ch 20:17 You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions; stand firm and see the deliverance the LORD will give you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, and the LORD will be with you.'"
142Ch 20:18 Jehoshaphat bowed with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the LORD.
142Ch 20:19 Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the LORD, the God of Israel, with very loud voice.
142Ch 20:20 Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, "Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the LORD your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful."
142Ch 20:21 After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the LORD and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying£º "Give thanks to the LORD, for his love endures forever."
142Ch 20:22 As they began to sing and praise, the LORD set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.
142Ch 20:23 The men of Ammon and Moab rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another.
142Ch 20:24 When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped.
142Ch 20:25 So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing and also articles of value--more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it.
142Ch 20:26 On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah, where they praised the LORD. This is why it is called the Valley of Beracah to this day.
142Ch 20:27 Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the LORD had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies.
142Ch 20:28 They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the LORD with harps and lutes and trumpets.
142Ch 20:29 The fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard how the LORD had fought against the enemies of Israel.
142Ch 20:30 And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.
142Ch 20:31 So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother's name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.
142Ch 20:32 He walked in the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
142Ch 20:33 The high places, however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their hearts on the God of their fathers.
142Ch 20:34 The other events of Jehoshaphat's reign, from beginning to end, are written in the annals of Jehu son of Hanani, which are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel.
142Ch 20:35 Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who was guilty of wickedness.
142Ch 20:36 He agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships. After these were built at Ezion Geber,
142Ch 20:37 Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, "Because you have made an alliance with Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy what you have made." The ships were wrecked and were not able to set sail to trade.
142Ch 21:1 Then Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 21:2 Jehoram's brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
142Ch 21:3 Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value, as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son.
142Ch 21:4 When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father's kingdom, he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the princes of Israel.
142Ch 21:5 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
142Ch 21:6 He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.
142Ch 21:7 Nevertheless, because of the covenant the LORD had made with David, the LORD was not willing to destroy the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever.
142Ch 21:8 In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king.
142Ch 21:9 So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night.
142Ch 21:10 To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the LORD, the God of his fathers.
142Ch 21:11 He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray.
142Ch 21:12 Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said£º "This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says£º 'You have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah.
142Ch 21:13 But you have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own brothers, members of your father's house, men who were better than you.
142Ch 21:14 So now the LORD is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives and everything that is yours, with a heavy blow.
142Ch 21:15 You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels, until the disease causes your bowels to come out.'"
142Ch 21:16 The LORD aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and of the Arabs who lived near the Cushites.
142Ch 21:17 They attacked Judah, invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the king's palace, together with his sons and wives. Not a son was left to him except Ahaziah, the youngest.
142Ch 21:18 After all this, the LORD afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels.
142Ch 21:19 In the course of time, at the end of the second year, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great pain. His people made no fire in his honor, as they had for his fathers.
142Ch 21:20 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. He passed away, to no one's regret, and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
142Ch 22:1 The people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram's youngest son, king in his place, since the raiders, who came with the Arabs into the camp, had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah began to reign.
142Ch 22:2 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother's name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.
142Ch 22:3 He too walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong.
142Ch 22:4 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as the house of Ahab had done, for after his father's death they became his advisers, to his undoing.
142Ch 22:5 He also followed their counsel when he went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram;
142Ch 22:6 so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at Ramoth in his battle with Hazael king of Aram. Then Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to Jezreel to see Joram son of Ahab because he had been wounded.
142Ch 22:7 Through Ahaziah's visit to Joram, God brought about Ahaziah's downfall. When Ahaziah arrived, he went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.
142Ch 22:8 While Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, he found the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's relatives, who had been attending Ahaziah, and he killed them.
142Ch 22:9 He then went in search of Ahaziah, and his men captured him while he was hiding in Samaria. He was brought to Jehu and put to death. They buried him, for they said, "He was a son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart." So there was no one in the house of Ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom.
142Ch 22:10 When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of Judah.
142Ch 22:11 But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Joash son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. Because Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of the priest Jehoiada, was Ahaziah's sister, she hid the child from Athaliah so she could not kill him.
142Ch 22:12 He remained hidden with them at the temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled the land.
142Ch 23:1 In the seventh year Jehoiada showed his strength. He made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred£º Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zicri.
142Ch 23:2 They went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites and the heads of Israelite families from all the towns. When they came to Jerusalem,
142Ch 23:3 the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of God. Jehoiada said to them, "The king's son shall reign, as the LORD promised concerning the descendants of David.
142Ch 23:4 Now this is what you are to do£º A third of you priests and Levites who are going on duty on the Sabbath are to keep watch at the doors,
142Ch 23:5 a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the Foundation Gate, and all the other men are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the LORD.
142Ch 23:6 No one is to enter the temple of the LORD except the priests and Levites on duty; they may enter because they are consecrated, but all the other men are to guard what the LORD has assigned to them.
142Ch 23:7 The Levites are to station themselves around the king, each man with his weapons in his hand. Anyone who enters the temple must be put to death. Stay close to the king wherever he goes."
142Ch 23:8 The Levites and all the men of Judah did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one took his men--those who were going on duty on the Sabbath and those who were going off duty--for Jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions.
142Ch 23:9 Then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were in the temple of God.
142Ch 23:10 He stationed all the men, each with his weapon in his hand, around the king--near the altar and the temple, from the south side to the north side of the temple.
142Ch 23:11 Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king's son and put the crown on him; they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king. They anointed him and shouted, "Long live the king!"
142Ch 23:12 When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king, she went to them at the temple of the LORD.
142Ch 23:13 She looked, and there was the king, standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and the trumpeters were beside the king, and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets, and singers with musical instruments were leading the praises. Then Athaliah tore her robes and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"
142Ch 23:14 Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred, who were in charge of the troops, and said to them£º "Bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her." For the priest had said, "Do not put her to death at the temple of the LORD."
142Ch 23:15 So they seized her as she reached the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and there they put her to death.
142Ch 23:16 Jehoiada then made a covenant that he and the people and the king would be the LORD'S people.
142Ch 23:17 All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed the altars and idols and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
142Ch 23:18 Then Jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the LORD in the hands of the priests, who were Levites, to whom David had made assignments in the temple, to present the burnt offerings of the LORD as written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and singing, as David had ordered.
142Ch 23:19 He also stationed doorkeepers at the gates of the LORD'S temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter.
142Ch 23:20 He took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the LORD. They went into the palace through the Upper Gate and seated the king on the royal throne,
142Ch 23:21 and all the people of the land rejoiced. And the city was quiet, because Athaliah had been slain with the sword.
142Ch 24:1 Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother's name was Zibiah; she was from Beersheba.
142Ch 24:2 Joash did what was right in the eyes of the LORD all the years of Jehoiada the priest.
142Ch 24:3 Jehoiada chose two wives for him, and he had sons and daughters.
142Ch 24:4 Some time later Joash decided to restore the temple of the LORD.
142Ch 24:5 He called together the priests and Levites and said to them, "Go to the towns of Judah and collect the money due annually from all Israel, to repair the temple of your God. Do it now." But the Levites did not act at once.
142Ch 24:6 Therefore the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him, "Why haven't you required the Levites to bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by Moses the servant of the LORD and by the assembly of Israel for the Tent of the Testimony?"
142Ch 24:7 Now the sons of that wicked woman Athaliah had broken into the temple of God and had used even its sacred objects for the Baals.
142Ch 24:8 At the king's command, a chest was made and placed outside, at the gate of the temple of the LORD.
142Ch 24:9 A proclamation was then issued in Judah and Jerusalem that they should bring to the LORD the tax that Moses the servant of God had required of Israel in the desert.
142Ch 24:10 All the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly, dropping them into the chest until it was full.
142Ch 24:11 Whenever the chest was brought in by the Levites to the king's officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money, the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place. They did this regularly and collected a great amount of money.
142Ch 24:12 The king and Jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the LORD. They hired masons and carpenters to restore the LORD'S temple, and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple.
142Ch 24:13 The men in charge of the work were diligent, and the repairs progressed under them. They rebuilt the temple of God according to its original design and reinforced it.
142Ch 24:14 When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and with it were made articles for the LORD'S temple£º articles for the service and for the burnt offerings, and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver. As long as Jehoiada lived, burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the LORD.
142Ch 24:15 Now Jehoiada was old and full of years, and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty.
142Ch 24:16 He was buried with the kings in the City of David, because of the good he had done in Israel for God and his temple.
142Ch 24:17 After the death of Jehoiada, the officials of Judah came and paid homage to the king, and he listened to them.
142Ch 24:18 They abandoned the temple of the LORD, the God of their fathers, and worshiped Asherah poles and idols. Because of their guilt, God's anger came upon Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 24:19 Although the LORD sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him, and though they testified against them, they would not listen.
142Ch 24:20 Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, "This is what God says£º 'Why do you disobey the LORD'S commands? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the LORD, he has forsaken you.'"
142Ch 24:21 But they plotted against him, and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the LORD'S temple.
142Ch 24:22 King Joash did not remember the kindness Zechariah's father Jehoiada had shown him but killed his son, who said as he lay dying, "May the LORD see this and call you to account."
142Ch 24:23 At the turn of the year, the army of Aram marched against Joash; it invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people. They sent all the plunder to their king in Damascus.
142Ch 24:24 Although the Aramean army had come with only a few men, the LORD delivered into their hands a much larger army. Because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers, judgment was executed on Joash.
142Ch 24:25 When the Arameans withdrew, they left Joash severely wounded. His officials conspired against him for murdering the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they killed him in his bed. So he died and was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
142Ch 24:26 Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of Shimeath an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, son of Shimrith a Moabite woman.
142Ch 24:27 The account of his sons, the many prophecies about him, and the record of the restoration of the temple of God are written in the annotations on the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 25:1 Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Jehoaddin; she was from Jerusalem.
142Ch 25:2 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but not wholeheartedly.
142Ch 25:3 After the kingdom was firmly in his control, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king.
142Ch 25:4 Yet he did not put their sons to death, but acted in accordance with what is written in the Law, in the Book of Moses, where the LORD commanded£º "Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sins."
142Ch 25:5 Amaziah called the people of Judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men ready for military service, able to handle the spear and shield.
142Ch 25:6 He also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from Israel for a hundred talents of silver.
142Ch 25:7 But a man of God came to him and said, "O king, these troops from Israel must not march with you, for the LORD is not with Israel--not with any of the people of Ephraim.
142Ch 25:8 Even if you go and fight courageously in battle, God will overthrow you before the enemy, for God has the power to help or to overthrow."
142Ch 25:9 Amaziah asked the man of God, "But what about the hundred talents I paid for these Israelite troops?" The man of God replied, "The LORD can give you much more than that."
142Ch 25:10 So Amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from Ephraim and sent them home. They were furious with Judah and left for home in a great rage.
142Ch 25:11 Amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where he killed ten thousand men of Seir.
142Ch 25:12 The army of Judah also captured ten thousand men alive, took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces.
142Ch 25:13 Meanwhile the troops that Amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided Judean towns from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder.
142Ch 25:14 When Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought back the gods of the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them.
142Ch 25:15 The anger of the LORD burned against Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him, who said, "Why do you consult this people's gods, which could not save their own people from your hand?"
142Ch 25:16 While he was still speaking, the king said to him, "Have we appointed you an adviser to the king? Stop! Why be struck down?" So the prophet stopped but said, "I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel."
142Ch 25:17 After Amaziah king of Judah consulted his advisers, he sent this challenge to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel£º "Come, meet me face to face."
142Ch 25:18 But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah£º "A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot.
142Ch 25:19 You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, and now you are arrogant and proud. But stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?"
142Ch 25:20 Amaziah, however, would not listen, for God so worked that he might hand them over to Jehoash, because they sought the gods of Edom.
142Ch 25:21 So Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah.
142Ch 25:22 Judah was routed by Israel, and every man fled to his home.
142Ch 25:23 Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, at Beth Shemesh. Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate--a section about six hundred feet long.
142Ch 25:24 He took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-Edom, together with the palace treasures and the hostages, and returned to Samaria.
142Ch 25:25 Amaziah son of Joash king of Judah lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.
142Ch 25:26 As for the other events of Amaziah's reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
142Ch 25:27 From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the LORD, they conspired against him in Jerusalem and he fled to Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him there.
142Ch 25:28 He was brought back by horse and was buried with his fathers in the City of Judah.
142Ch 26:1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah.
142Ch 26:2 He was the one who rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah after Amaziah rested with his fathers.
142Ch 26:3 Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother's name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem.
142Ch 26:4 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Amaziah had done.
142Ch 26:5 He sought God during the days of Zechariah, who instructed him in the fear of God. As long as he sought the LORD, God gave him success.
142Ch 26:6 He went to war against the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.
142Ch 26:7 God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the Meunites.
142Ch 26:8 The Ammonites brought tribute to Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the border of Egypt, because he had become very powerful.
142Ch 26:9 Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall, and he fortified them.
142Ch 26:10 He also built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns, because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, for he loved the soil.
142Ch 26:11 Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one of the royal officials.
142Ch 26:12 The total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2,600.
142Ch 26:13 Under their command was an army of 307,500 men trained for war, a powerful force to support the king against his enemies.
142Ch 26:14 Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmets, coats of armor, bows and slingstones for the entire army.
142Ch 26:15 In Jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men for use on the towers and on the corner defenses to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. His fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful.
142Ch 26:16 But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was unfaithful to the LORD his God, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.
142Ch 26:17 Azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the LORD followed him in.
142Ch 26:18 They confronted him and said, "It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be honored by the LORD God."
142Ch 26:19 Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the LORD'S temple, leprosy broke out on his forehead.
142Ch 26:20 When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the LORD had afflicted him.
142Ch 26:21 King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house --leprous, and excluded from the temple of the LORD. Jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land.
142Ch 26:22 The other events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
142Ch 26:23 Uzziah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in a field for burial that belonged to the kings, for people said, "He had leprosy." And Jotham his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 27:1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother's name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.
142Ch 27:2 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done, but unlike him he did not enter the temple of the LORD. The people, however, continued their corrupt practices.
142Ch 27:3 Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the temple of the LORD and did extensive work on the wall at the hill of Ophel.
142Ch 27:4 He built towns in the Judean hills and forts and towers in the wooded areas.
142Ch 27:5 Jotham made war on the king of the Ammonites and conquered them. That year the Ammonites paid him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand cors of barley. The Ammonites brought him the same amount also in the second and third years.
142Ch 27:6 Jotham grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the LORD his God.
142Ch 27:7 The other events in Jotham's reign, including all his wars and the other things he did, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
142Ch 27:8 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
142Ch 27:9 Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And Ahaz his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 28:1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. Unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD.
142Ch 28:2 He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made cast idols for worshiping the Baals.
142Ch 28:3 He burned sacrifices in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire, following the detestable ways of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
142Ch 28:4 He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places, on the hilltops and under every spreading tree.
142Ch 28:5 Therefore the LORD his God handed him over to the king of Aram. The Arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to Damascus. He was also given into the hands of the king of Israel, who inflicted heavy casualties on him.
142Ch 28:6 In one day Pekah son of Remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in Judah--because Judah had forsaken the LORD, the God of their fathers.
142Ch 28:7 Zicri, an Ephraimite warrior, killed Maaseiah the king's son, Azrikam the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, second to the king.
142Ch 28:8 The Israelites took captive from their kinsmen two hundred thousand wives, sons and daughters. They also took a great deal of plunder, which they carried back to Samaria.
142Ch 28:9 But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there, and he went out to meet the army when it returned to Samaria. He said to them, "Because the LORD, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he gave them into your hand. But you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven.
142Ch 28:10 And now you intend to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves. But aren't you also guilty of sins against the LORD your God?
142Ch 28:11 Now listen to me! Send back your fellow countrymen you have taken as prisoners, for the LORD'S fierce anger rests on you."
142Ch 28:12 Then some of the leaders in Ephraim--Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai--confronted those who were arriving from the war.
142Ch 28:13 "You must not bring those prisoners here," they said, "or we will be guilty before the LORD. Do you intend to add to our sin and guilt? For our guilt is already great, and his fierce anger rests on Israel."
142Ch 28:14 So the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly.
142Ch 28:15 The men designated by name took the prisoners, and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked. They provided them with clothes and sandals, food and drink, and healing balm. All those who were weak they put on donkeys. So they took them back to their fellow countrymen at Jericho, the City of Palms, and returned to Samaria.
142Ch 28:16 At that time King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help.
142Ch 28:17 The Edomites had again come and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners,
142Ch 28:18 while the Philistines had raided towns in the foothills and in the Negev of Judah. They captured and occupied Beth Shemesh, Aijalon and Gederoth, as well as Soco, Timnah and Gimzo, with their surrounding villages.
142Ch 28:19 The LORD had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had promoted wickedness in Judah and had been most unfaithful to the LORD.
142Ch 28:20 Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him, but he gave him trouble instead of help.
142Ch 28:21 Ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the LORD and from the royal palace and from the princes and presented them to the king of Assyria, but that did not help him.
142Ch 28:22 In his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the LORD.
142Ch 28:23 He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus, who had defeated him; for he thought, "Since the gods of the kings of Aram have helped them, I will sacrifice to them so they will help me." But they were his downfall and the downfall of all Israel.
142Ch 28:24 Ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of God and took them away. He shut the doors of the LORD'S temple and set up altars at every street corner in Jerusalem.
142Ch 28:25 In every town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and provoked the LORD, the God of his fathers, to anger.
142Ch 28:26 The other events of his reign and all his ways, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 28:27 Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 29:1 Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother's name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.
142Ch 29:2 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father David had done.
142Ch 29:3 In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the temple of the LORD and repaired them.
142Ch 29:4 He brought in the priests and the Levites, assembled them in the square on the east side
142Ch 29:5 and said£º "Listen to me, Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the LORD, the God of your fathers. Remove all defilement from the sanctuary.
142Ch 29:6 Our fathers were unfaithful; they did evil in the eyes of the LORD our God and forsook him. They turned their faces away from the LORD'S dwelling place and turned their backs on him.
142Ch 29:7 They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel.
142Ch 29:8 Therefore, the anger of the LORD has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem; he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn, as you can see with your own eyes.
142Ch 29:9 This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity.
142Ch 29:10 Now I intend to make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn away from us.
142Ch 29:11 My sons, do not be negligent now, for the LORD has chosen you to stand before him and serve him, to minister before him and to burn incense."
142Ch 29:12 Then these Levites set to work£º from the Kohathites, Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah; from the Merarites, Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel; from the Gershonites, Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah;
142Ch 29:13 from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeiel; from the descendants of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;
142Ch 29:14 from the descendants of Heman, Jehiel and Shimei; from the descendants of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
142Ch 29:15 When they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves, they went in to purify the temple of the LORD, as the king had ordered, following the word of the LORD.
142Ch 29:16 The priests went into the sanctuary of the LORD to purify it. They brought out to the courtyard of the LORD'S temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the LORD. The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley.
142Ch 29:17 They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the LORD. For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the LORD itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month.
142Ch 29:18 Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported£º "We have purified the entire temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table for setting out the consecrated bread, with all its articles.
142Ch 29:19 We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king. They are now in front of the LORD'S altar."
142Ch 29:20 Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the LORD.
142Ch 29:21 They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the LORD.
142Ch 29:22 So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar.
142Ch 29:23 The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
142Ch 29:24 The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel.
142Ch 29:25 He stationed the Levites in the temple of the LORD with cymbals, harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king's seer and Nathan the prophet; this was commanded by the LORD through his prophets.
142Ch 29:26 So the Levites stood ready with David's instruments, and the priests with their trumpets.
142Ch 29:27 Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the LORD began also, accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel.
142Ch 29:28 The whole assembly bowed in worship, while the singers sang and the trumpeters played. All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed.
142Ch 29:29 When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped.
142Ch 29:30 King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped.
142Ch 29:31 Then Hezekiah said, "You have now dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the LORD." So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings.
142Ch 29:32 The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs--all of them for burnt offerings to the LORD.
142Ch 29:33 The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats.
142Ch 29:34 The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their kinsmen the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been.
142Ch 29:35 There were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the fellowship offerings and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings. So the service of the temple of the LORD was reestablished.
142Ch 29:36 Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people, because it was done so quickly.
142Ch 30:1 Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the temple of the LORD in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 30:2 The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month.
142Ch 30:3 They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem.
142Ch 30:4 The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly.
142Ch 30:5 They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the LORD, the God of Israel. It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written.
142Ch 30:6 At the king's command, couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials, which read£º "People of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to you who are left, who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.
142Ch 30:7 Do not be like your fathers and brothers, who were unfaithful to the LORD, the God of their fathers, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see.
142Ch 30:8 Do not be stiff-necked, as your fathers were; submit to the LORD. Come to the sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that his fierce anger will turn away from you.
142Ch 30:9 If you return to the LORD, then your brothers and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will come back to this land, for the LORD your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him."
142Ch 30:10 The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but the people scorned and ridiculed them.
142Ch 30:11 Nevertheless, some men of Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.
142Ch 30:12 Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered, following the word of the LORD.
142Ch 30:13 A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month.
142Ch 30:14 They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
142Ch 30:15 They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the LORD.
142Ch 30:16 Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood handed to them by the Levites.
142Ch 30:17 Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs to the LORD.
142Ch 30:18 Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, "May the LORD, who is good, pardon everyone
142Ch 30:19 who sets his heart on seeking God--the LORD, the God of his fathers--even if he is not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary."
142Ch 30:20 And the LORD heard Hezekiah and healed the people.
142Ch 30:21 The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing, while the Levites and priests sang to the LORD every day, accompanied by the LORD'S instruments of praise.
142Ch 30:22 Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who showed good understanding of the service of the LORD. For the seven days they ate their assigned portion and offered fellowship offerings and praised the LORD, the God of their fathers.
142Ch 30:23 The whole assembly then agreed to celebrate the festival seven more days; so for another seven days they celebrated joyfully.
142Ch 30:24 Hezekiah king of Judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats for the assembly, and the officials provided them with a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and goats. A great number of priests consecrated themselves.
142Ch 30:25 The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites and all who had assembled from Israel, including the aliens who had come from Israel and those who lived in Judah.
142Ch 30:26 There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.
142Ch 30:27 The priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard them, for their prayer reached heaven, his holy dwelling place.
142Ch 31:1 When all this had ended, the Israelites who were there went out to the towns of Judah, smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles. They destroyed the high places and the altars throughout Judah and Benjamin and in Ephraim and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property.
142Ch 31:2 Hezekiah assigned the priests and Levites to divisions--each of them according to their duties as priests or Levites--to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to minister, to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the LORD'S dwelling.
142Ch 31:3 The king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moons and appointed feasts as written in the Law of the LORD.
142Ch 31:4 He ordered the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites so they could devote themselves to the Law of the LORD.
142Ch 31:5 As soon as the order went out, the Israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain, new wine, oil and honey and all that the fields produced. They brought a great amount, a tithe of everything.
142Ch 31:6 The men of Israel and Judah who lived in the towns of Judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled them in heaps.
142Ch 31:7 They began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month.
142Ch 31:8 When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps, they praised the LORD and blessed his people Israel.
142Ch 31:9 Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the heaps;
142Ch 31:10 and Azariah the chief priest, from the family of Zadok, answered, "Since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the LORD, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare, because the LORD has blessed his people, and this great amount is left over."
142Ch 31:11 Hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the LORD, and this was done.
142Ch 31:12 Then they faithfully brought in the contributions, tithes and dedicated gifts. Conaniah, a Levite, was in charge of these things, and his brother Shimei was next in rank.
142Ch 31:13 Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath and Benaiah were supervisors under Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the official in charge of the temple of God.
142Ch 31:14 Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was in charge of the freewill offerings given to God, distributing the contributions made to the LORD and also the consecrated gifts.
142Ch 31:15 Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah and Shecaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests, distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions, old and young alike.
142Ch 31:16 In addition, they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records--all who would enter the temple of the LORD to perform the daily duties of their various tasks, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
142Ch 31:17 And they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the Levites twenty years old or more, according to their responsibilities and their divisions.
142Ch 31:18 They included all the little ones, the wives, and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records. For they were faithful in consecrating themselves.
142Ch 31:19 As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who lived on the farm lands around their towns or in any other towns, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the Levites.
142Ch 31:20 This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah, doing what was good and right and faithful before the LORD his God.
142Ch 31:21 In everything that he undertook in the service of God's temple and in obedience to the law and the commands, he sought his God and worked wholeheartedly. And so he prospered.
142Ch 32:1 After all that Hezekiah had so faithfully done, Sennacherib king of Assyria came and invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself.
142Ch 32:2 When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to make war on Jerusalem,
142Ch 32:3 he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city, and they helped him.
142Ch 32:4 A large force of men assembled, and they blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. "Why should the kings of Assyria come and find plenty of water?" they said.
142Ch 32:5 Then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it. He built another wall outside that one and reinforced the supporting terraces of the City of David. He also made large numbers of weapons and shields.
142Ch 32:6 He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words£º
142Ch 32:7 "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater power with us than with him.
142Ch 32:8 With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles." And the people gained confidence from what Hezekiah the king of Judah said.
142Ch 32:9 Later, when Sennacherib king of Assyria and all his forces were laying siege to Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah king of Judah and for all the people of Judah who were there£º
142Ch 32:10 "This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says£º On what are you basing your confidence, that you remain in Jerusalem under siege?
142Ch 32:11 When Hezekiah says, 'The LORD our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria,' he is misleading you, to let you die of hunger and thirst.
142Ch 32:12 Did not Hezekiah himself remove this god's high places and altars, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, 'You must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it'?
142Ch 32:13 "Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the other lands? Were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand?
142Ch 32:14 Who of all the gods of these nations that my fathers destroyed has been able to save his people from me? How then can your god deliver you from my hand?
142Ch 32:15 Now do not let Hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this. Do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your god deliver you from my hand!"
142Ch 32:16 Sennacherib's officers spoke further against the LORD God and against his servant Hezekiah.
142Ch 32:17 The king also wrote letters insulting the LORD, the God of Israel, and saying this against him£º "Just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand, so the god of Hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand."
142Ch 32:18 Then they called out in Hebrew to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city.
142Ch 32:19 They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world--the work of men's hands.
142Ch 32:20 King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this.
142Ch 32:21 And the LORD sent an angel, who annihilated all the fighting men and the leaders and officers in the camp of the Assyrian king. So he withdrew to his own land in disgrace. And when he went into the temple of his god, some of his sons cut him down with the sword.
142Ch 32:22 So the LORD saved Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Assyria and from the hand of all others. He took care of them on every side.
142Ch 32:23 Many brought offerings to Jerusalem for the LORD and valuable gifts for Hezekiah king of Judah. From then on he was highly regarded by all the nations.
142Ch 32:24 In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. He prayed to the LORD, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign.
142Ch 32:25 But Hezekiah's heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him; therefore the LORD'S wrath was on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 32:26 Then Hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart, as did the people of Jerusalem; therefore the LORD'S wrath did not come upon them during the days of Hezekiah.
142Ch 32:27 Hezekiah had very great riches and honor, and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones, spices, shields and all kinds of valuables.
142Ch 32:28 He also made buildings to store the harvest of grain, new wine and oil; and he made stalls for various kinds of cattle, and pens for the flocks.
142Ch 32:29 He built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds, for God had given him very great riches.
142Ch 32:30 It was Hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the Gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the City of David. He succeeded in everything he undertook.
142Ch 32:31 But when envoys were sent by the rulers of Babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land, God left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart.
142Ch 32:32 The other events of Hezekiah's reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 32:33 Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried on the hill where the tombs of David's descendants are. All Judah and the people of Jerusalem honored him when he died. And Manasseh his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 33:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years.
142Ch 33:2 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, following the detestable practices of the nations the LORD had driven out before the Israelites.
142Ch 33:3 He rebuilt the high places his father Hezekiah had demolished; he also erected altars to the Baals and made Asherah poles. He bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them.
142Ch 33:4 He built altars in the temple of the LORD, of which the LORD had said, "My Name will remain in Jerusalem forever."
142Ch 33:5 In both courts of the temple of the LORD, he built altars to all the starry hosts.
142Ch 33:6 He sacrificed his sons in the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, practiced sorcery, divination and witchcraft, and consulted mediums and spiritists. He did much evil in the eyes of the LORD, provoking him to anger.
142Ch 33:7 He took the carved image he had made and put it in God's temple, of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon, "In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my Name forever.
142Ch 33:8 I will not again make the feet of the Israelites leave the land I assigned to your forefathers, if only they will be careful to do everything I commanded them concerning all the laws, decrees and ordinances given through Moses."
142Ch 33:9 But Manasseh led Judah and the people of Jerusalem astray, so that they did more evil than the nations the LORD had destroyed before the Israelites.
142Ch 33:10 The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they paid no attention.
142Ch 33:11 So the LORD brought against them the army commanders of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh prisoner, put a hook in his nose, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon.
142Ch 33:12 In his distress he sought the favor of the LORD his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
142Ch 33:13 And when he prayed to him, the LORD was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea; so he brought him back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD is God.
142Ch 33:14 Afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, west of the Gihon spring in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate and encircling the hill of Ophel; he also made it much higher. He stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.
142Ch 33:15 He got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the LORD, as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in Jerusalem; and he threw them out of the city.
142Ch 33:16 Then he restored the altar of the LORD and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it, and told Judah to serve the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 33:17 The people, however, continued to sacrifice at the high places, but only to the LORD their God.
142Ch 33:18 The other events of Manasseh's reign, including his prayer to his God and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, are written in the annals of the kings of Israel.
142Ch 33:19 His prayer and how God was moved by his entreaty, as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness, and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself--all are written in the records of the seers.
142Ch 33:20 Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace. And Amon his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 33:21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.
142Ch 33:22 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the idols Manasseh had made.
142Ch 33:23 But unlike his father Manasseh, he did not humble himself before the LORD; Amon increased his guilt.
142Ch 33:24 Amon's officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.
142Ch 33:25 Then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against King Amon, and they made Josiah his son king in his place.
142Ch 34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.
142Ch 34:2 He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD and walked in the ways of his father David, not turning aside to the right or to the left.
142Ch 34:3 In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his father David. In his twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of high places, Asherah poles, carved idols and cast images.
142Ch 34:4 Under his direction the altars of the Baals were torn down; he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them, and smashed the Asherah poles, the idols and the images. These he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
142Ch 34:5 He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and so he purged Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:6 In the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, as far as Naphtali, and in the ruins around them,
142Ch 34:7 he tore down the altars and the Asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:8 In the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign, to purify the land and the temple, he sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and Maaseiah the ruler of the city, with Joah son of Joahaz, the recorder, to repair the temple of the LORD his God.
142Ch 34:9 They went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of God, which the Levites who were the doorkeepers had collected from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim and the entire remnant of Israel and from all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:10 Then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the LORD'S temple. These men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple.
142Ch 34:11 They also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone, and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.
142Ch 34:12 The men did the work faithfully. Over them to direct them were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites descended from Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, descended from Kohath. The Levites--all who were skilled in playing musical instruments--
142Ch 34:13 had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job. Some of the Levites were secretaries, scribes and doorkeepers.
142Ch 34:14 While they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD that had been given through Moses.
142Ch 34:15 Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the temple of the LORD." He gave it to Shaphan.
142Ch 34:16 Then Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him£º "Your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them.
142Ch 34:17 They have paid out the money that was in the temple of the LORD and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers."
142Ch 34:18 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
142Ch 34:19 When the king heard the words of the Law, he tore his robes.
142Ch 34:20 He gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king's attendant£º
142Ch 34:21 "Go and inquire of the LORD for me and for the remnant in Israel and Judah about what is written in this book that has been found. Great is the LORD'S anger that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD; they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book."
142Ch 34:22 Hilkiah and those the king had sent with him went to speak to the prophetess Huldah, who was the wife of Shallum son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe. She lived in Jerusalem, in the Second District.
142Ch 34:23 She said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º Tell the man who sent you to me,
142Ch 34:24 'This is what the LORD says£º I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people--all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of Judah.
142Ch 34:25 Because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all that their hands have made, my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched.'
142Ch 34:26 Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the words you heard£º
142Ch 34:27 Because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people, and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence, I have heard you, declares the LORD.
142Ch 34:28 Now I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be buried in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster I am going to bring on this place and on those who live here.'" So they took her answer back to the king.
142Ch 34:29 Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:30 He went up to the temple of the LORD with the men of Judah, the people of Jerusalem, the priests and the Levites--all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the LORD.
142Ch 34:31 The king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the LORD--to follow the LORD and keep his commands, regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book.
142Ch 34:32 Then he had everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin pledge themselves to it; the people of Jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
142Ch 34:33 Josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the Israelites, and he had all who were present in Israel serve the LORD their God. As long as he lived, they did not fail to follow the LORD, the God of their fathers.
142Ch 35:1 Josiah celebrated the Passover to the LORD in Jerusalem, and the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month.
142Ch 35:2 He appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the LORD'S temple.
142Ch 35:3 He said to the Levites, who instructed all Israel and who had been consecrated to the LORD£º "Put the sacred ark in the temple that Solomon son of David king of Israel built. It is not to be carried about on your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.
142Ch 35:4 Prepare yourselves by families in your divisions, according to the directions written by David king of Israel and by his son Solomon.
142Ch 35:5 "Stand in the holy place with a group of Levites for each subdivision of the families of your fellow countrymen, the lay people.
142Ch 35:6 Slaughter the Passover lambs, consecrate yourselves and prepare the lambs for your fellow countrymen, doing what the LORD commanded through Moses."
142Ch 35:7 Josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand sheep and goats for the Passover offerings, and also three thousand cattle--all from the king's own possessions.
142Ch 35:8 His officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah and Jehiel, the administrators of God's temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred Passover offerings and three hundred cattle.
142Ch 35:9 Also Conaniah along with Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, provided five thousand Passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the Levites.
142Ch 35:10 The service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the Levites in their divisions as the king had ordered.
142Ch 35:11 The Passover lambs were slaughtered, and the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them, while the Levites skinned the animals.
142Ch 35:12 They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the LORD, as is written in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.
142Ch 35:13 They roasted the Passover animals over the fire as prescribed, and boiled the holy offerings in pots, caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people.
142Ch 35:14 After this, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, because the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the Aaronic priests.
142Ch 35:15 The musicians, the descendants of Asaph, were in the places prescribed by David, Asaph, Heman and Jeduthun the king's seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts, because their fellow Levites made the preparations for them.
142Ch 35:16 So at that time the entire service of the LORD was carried out for the celebration of the Passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, as King Josiah had ordered.
142Ch 35:17 The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover at that time and observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
142Ch 35:18 The Passover had not been observed like this in Israel since the days of the prophet Samuel; and none of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated such a Passover as did Josiah, with the priests, the Levites and all Judah and Israel who were there with the people of Jerusalem.
142Ch 35:19 This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.
142Ch 35:20 After all this, when Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah marched out to meet him in battle.
142Ch 35:21 But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, "What quarrel is there between you and me, O king of Judah? It is not you I am attacking at this time, but the house with which I am at war. God has told me to hurry; so stop opposing God, who is with me, or he will destroy you."
142Ch 35:22 Josiah, however, would not turn away from him, but disguised himself to engage him in battle. He would not listen to what Neco had said at God's command but went to fight him on the plain of Megiddo.
142Ch 35:23 Archers shot King Josiah, and he told his officers, "Take me away; I am badly wounded."
142Ch 35:24 So they took him out of his chariot, put him in the other chariot he had and brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried in the tombs of his fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.
142Ch 35:25 Jeremiah composed laments for Josiah, and to this day all the men and women singers commemorate Josiah in the laments. These became a tradition in Israel and are written in the Laments.
142Ch 35:26 The other events of Josiah's reign and his acts of devotion, according to what is written in the Law of the LORD--
142Ch 35:27 all the events, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
142Ch 36:1 And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and made him king in Jerusalem in place of his father.
142Ch 36:2 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months.
142Ch 36:3 The king of Egypt dethroned him in Jerusalem and imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
142Ch 36:4 The king of Egypt made Eliakim, a brother of Jehoahaz, king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Eliakim's brother Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt.
142Ch 36:5 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD his God.
142Ch 36:6 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked him and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.
142Ch 36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also took to Babylon articles from the temple of the LORD and put them in his temple there.
142Ch 36:8 The other events of Jehoiakim's reign, the detestable things he did and all that was found against him, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king.
142Ch 36:9 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. He did evil in the eyes of the LORD.
142Ch 36:10 In the spring, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon, together with articles of value from the temple of the LORD, and he made Jehoiachin's uncle, Zedekiah, king over Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 36:11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.
142Ch 36:12 He did evil in the eyes of the LORD his God and did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke the word of the LORD.
142Ch 36:13 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him take an oath in God's name. He became stiff-necked and hardened his heart and would not turn to the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 36:14 Furthermore, all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful, following all the detestable practices of the nations and defiling the temple of the LORD, which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.
142Ch 36:15 The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent word to them through his messengers again and again, because he had pity on his people and on his dwelling place.
142Ch 36:16 But they mocked God's messengers, despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the LORD was aroused against his people and there was no remedy.
142Ch 36:17 He brought up against them the king of the Babylonians, who killed their young men with the sword in the sanctuary, and spared neither young man nor young woman, old man or aged. God handed all of them over to Nebuchadnezzar.
142Ch 36:18 He carried to Babylon all the articles from the temple of God, both large and small, and the treasures of the LORD'S temple and the treasures of the king and his officials.
142Ch 36:19 They set fire to God's temple and broke down the wall of Jerusalem; they burned all the palaces and destroyed everything of value there.
142Ch 36:20 He carried into exile to Babylon the remnant, who escaped from the sword, and they became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia came to power.
142Ch 36:21 The land enjoyed its sabbath rests; all the time of its desolation it rested, until the seventy years were completed in fulfillment of the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah.
142Ch 36:22 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing£º
142Ch 36:23 "This is what Cyrus king of Persia says£º "'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah. Anyone of his people among you--may the LORD his God be with him, and let him go up.'"
15
15Ezr 1:1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah, the LORD moved the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing£º
15Ezr 1:2 "This is what Cyrus king of Persia says£º "'The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at Jerusalem in Judah.
15Ezr 1:3 Anyone of his people among you--may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the temple of the LORD, the God of Israel, the God who is in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 1:4 And the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with freewill offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem.'"
15Ezr 1:5 Then the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites--everyone whose heart God had moved--prepared to go up and build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 1:6 All their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, in addition to all the freewill offerings.
15Ezr 1:7 Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the temple of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his god.
15Ezr 1:8 Cyrus king of Persia had them brought by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
15Ezr 1:9 This was the inventory£º gold dishes 30 silver dishes 1,000 silver pans 29
15Ezr 1:10 gold bowls 30 matching silver bowls 410 other articles 1,000
15Ezr 1:11 In all, there were 5,400 articles of gold and of silver. Sheshbazzar brought all these along when the exiles came up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
15Ezr 2:1 Now these are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive to Babylon (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,

15Ezr 2:61 And from among the priests£º The descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz and Barzillai (a man who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by that name).
15Ezr 2:62 These searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
15Ezr 2:63 The governor ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there was a priest ministering with the Urim and Thummim.
15Ezr 2:64 The whole company numbered 42,360,
15Ezr 2:65 besides their 7,337 menservants and maidservants; and they also had 200 men and women singers.
15Ezr 2:66 They had 736 horses, 245 mules,
15Ezr 2:67 435 camels and 6,720 donkeys.
15Ezr 2:68 When they arrived at the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, some of the heads of the families gave freewill offerings toward the rebuilding of the house of God on its site.
15Ezr 2:69 According to their ability they gave to the treasury for this work 61,000 drachmas of gold, 5,000 minas of silver and 100 priestly garments.
15Ezr 2:70 The priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers and the temple servants settled in their own towns, along with some of the other people, and the rest of the Israelites settled in their towns.
15Ezr 3:1 When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns, the people assembled as one man in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 3:2 Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his associates began to build the altar of the God of Israel to sacrifice burnt offerings on it, in accordance with what is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.
15Ezr 3:3 Despite their fear of the peoples around them, they built the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the LORD, both the morning and evening sacrifices.
15Ezr 3:4 Then in accordance with what is written, they celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles with the required number of burnt offerings prescribed for each day.
15Ezr 3:5 After that, they presented the regular burnt offerings, the New Moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred feasts of the LORD, as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the LORD.
15Ezr 3:6 On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, though the foundation of the LORD'S temple had not yet been laid.
15Ezr 3:7 Then they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and gave food and drink and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so that they would bring cedar logs by sea from Lebanon to Joppa, as authorized by Cyrus king of Persia.
15Ezr 3:8 In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers (the priests and the Levites and all who had returned from the captivity to Jerusalem) began the work, appointing Levites twenty years of age and older to supervise the building of the house of the LORD.
15Ezr 3:9 Jeshua and his sons and brothers and Kadmiel and his sons (descendants of Hodaviah) and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers--all Levites--joined together in supervising those working on the house of God.
15Ezr 3:10 When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments and with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) with cymbals, took their places to praise the LORD, as prescribed by David king of Israel.
15Ezr 3:11 With praise and thanksgiving they sang to the LORD£º "He is good; his love to Israel endures forever." And all the people gave a great shout of praise to the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
15Ezr 3:12 But many of the older priests and Levites and family heads, who had seen the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy.
15Ezr 3:13 No one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise. And the sound was heard far away.
15Ezr 4:1 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the LORD, the God of Israel,
15Ezr 4:2 they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said, "Let us help you build because, like you, we seek your God and have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here."
15Ezr 4:3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel answered, "You have no part with us in building a temple to our God. We alone will build it for the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, commanded us."
15Ezr 4:4 Then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of Judah and make them afraid to go on building.
15Ezr 4:5 They hired counselors to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of Cyrus king of Persia and down to the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15Ezr 4:6 At the beginning of the reign of Xerxes, they lodged an accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
15Ezr 4:7 And in the days of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. The letter was written in Aramaic script and in the Aramaic language.
15Ezr 4:8 Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows£º
15Ezr 4:9 Rehum the commanding officer and Shimshai the secretary, together with the rest of their associates--the judges and officials over the men from Tripolis, Persia, Erech and Babylon, the Elamites of Susa,
15Ezr 4:10 and the other people whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates.
15Ezr 4:11 (This is a copy of the letter they sent him.) To King Artaxerxes, From your servants, the men of Trans-Euphrates£º
15Ezr 4:12 The king should know that the Jews who came up to us from you have gone to Jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city. They are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations.
15Ezr 4:13 Furthermore, the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored, no more taxes, tribute or duty will be paid, and the royal revenues will suffer.
15Ezr 4:14 Now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored, we are sending this message to inform the king,
15Ezr 4:15 so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors. In these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city, troublesome to kings and provinces, a place of rebellion from ancient times. That is why this city was destroyed.
15Ezr 4:16 We inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates.
15Ezr 4:17 The king sent this reply£º To Rehum the commanding officer, Shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in Samaria and elsewhere in Trans-Euphrates£º Greetings.
15Ezr 4:18 The letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence.
15Ezr 4:19 I issued an order and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition.
15Ezr 4:20 Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes, tribute and duty were paid to them.
15Ezr 4:21 Now issue an order to these men to stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until I so order.
15Ezr 4:22 Be careful not to neglect this matter. Why let this threat grow, to the detriment of the royal interests?
15Ezr 4:23 As soon as the copy of the letter of King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and their associates, they went immediately to the Jews in Jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop.
15Ezr 4:24 Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
15Ezr 5:1 Now Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the prophet, a descendant of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them.
15Ezr 5:2 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak set to work to rebuild the house of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them, helping them.
15Ezr 5:3 At that time Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates went to them and asked, "Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?"
15Ezr 5:4 They also asked, "What are the names of the men constructing this building?"
15Ezr 5:5 But the eye of their God was watching over the elders of the Jews, and they were not stopped until a report could go to Darius and his written reply be received.
15Ezr 5:6 This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, the officials of Trans-Euphrates, sent to King Darius.
15Ezr 5:7 The report they sent him read as follows£º To King Darius£º Cordial greetings.
15Ezr 5:8 The king should know that we went to the district of Judah, to the temple of the great God. The people are building it with large stones and placing the timbers in the walls. The work is being carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their direction.
15Ezr 5:9 We questioned the elders and asked them, "Who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure?"
15Ezr 5:10 We also asked them their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.
15Ezr 5:11 This is the answer they gave us£º "We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, one that a great king of Israel built and finished.
15Ezr 5:12 But because our fathers angered the God of heaven, he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean, king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
15Ezr 5:13 "However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
15Ezr 5:14 He even removed from the temple of Babylon the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylon. "Then King Cyrus gave them to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor,
15Ezr 5:15 and he told him, 'Take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem. And rebuild the house of God on its site.'
15Ezr 5:16 So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem. From that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished."
15Ezr 5:17 Now if it pleases the king, let a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to see if King Cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision in this matter.
15Ezr 6:1 King Darius then issued an order, and they searched in the archives stored in the treasury at Babylon.
15Ezr 6:2 A scroll was found in the citadel of Ecbatana in the province of Media, and this was written on it£º Memorandum£º
15Ezr 6:3 In the first year of King Cyrus, the king issued a decree concerning the temple of God in Jerusalem£º Let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices, and let its foundations be laid. It is to be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide,
15Ezr 6:4 with three courses of large stones and one of timbers. The costs are to be paid by the royal treasury.
15Ezr 6:5 Also, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be returned to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; they are to be deposited in the house of God.
15Ezr 6:6 Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and you, their fellow officials of that province, stay away from there.
15Ezr 6:7 Do not interfere with the work on this temple of God. Let the governor of the Jews and the Jewish elders rebuild this house of God on its site.
15Ezr 6:8 Moreover, I hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the Jews in the construction of this house of God£º The expenses of these men are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury, from the revenues of Trans-Euphrates, so that the work will not stop.
15Ezr 6:9 Whatever is needed--young bulls, rams, male lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem--must be given them daily without fail,
15Ezr 6:10 so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven and pray for the well-being of the king and his sons.
15Ezr 6:11 Furthermore, I decree that if anyone changes this edict, a beam is to be pulled from his house and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it. And for this crime his house is to be made a pile of rubble.
15Ezr 6:12 May God, who has caused his Name to dwell there, overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in Jerusalem. I Darius have decreed it. Let it be carried out with diligence.
15Ezr 6:13 Then, because of the decree King Darius had sent, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates carried it out with diligence.
15Ezr 6:14 So the elders of the Jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the temple according to the command of the God of Israel and the decrees of Cyrus, Darius and Artaxerxes, kings of Persia.
15Ezr 6:15 The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.
15Ezr 6:16 Then the people of Israel--the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles--celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy.
15Ezr 6:17 For the dedication of this house of God they offered a hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred male lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats, one for each of the tribes of Israel.
15Ezr 6:18 And they installed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their groups for the service of God at Jerusalem, according to what is written in the Book of Moses.
15Ezr 6:19 On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles celebrated the Passover.
15Ezr 6:20 The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their brothers the priests and for themselves.
15Ezr 6:21 So the Israelites who had returned from the exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their Gentile neighbors in order to seek the LORD, the God of Israel.
15Ezr 6:22 For seven days they celebrated with joy the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because the LORD had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of Assyria, so that he assisted them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel.
15Ezr 7:1 After these things, during the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
15Ezr 7:2 the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
15Ezr 7:3 the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
15Ezr 7:4 the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
15Ezr 7:5 the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest--
15Ezr 7:6 this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a teacher well versed in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given. The king had granted him everything he asked, for the hand of the LORD his God was on him.
15Ezr 7:7 Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers and temple servants, also came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.
15Ezr 7:8 Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king.
15Ezr 7:9 He had begun his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, for the gracious hand of his God was on him.
15Ezr 7:10 For Ezra had devoted himself to the study and observance of the Law of the LORD, and to teaching its decrees and laws in Israel.
15Ezr 7:11 This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes had given to Ezra the priest and teacher, a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the LORD for Israel£º
15Ezr 7:12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, To Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven£º Greetings.
15Ezr 7:13 Now I decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including priests and Levites, who wish to go to Jerusalem with you, may go.
15Ezr 7:14 You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with regard to the Law of your God, which is in your hand.
15Ezr 7:15 Moreover, you are to take with you the silver and gold that the king and his advisers have freely given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,
15Ezr 7:16 together with all the silver and gold you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the temple of their God in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:17 With this money be sure to buy bulls, rams and male lambs, together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and sacrifice them on the altar of the temple of your God in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:18 You and your brother Jews may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, in accordance with the will of your God.
15Ezr 7:19 Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles entrusted to you for worship in the temple of your God.
15Ezr 7:20 And anything else needed for the temple of your God that you may have occasion to supply, you may provide from the royal treasury.
15Ezr 7:21 Now I, King Artaxerxes, order all the treasurers of Trans-Euphrates to provide with diligence whatever Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven, may ask of you--
15Ezr 7:22 up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred cors of wheat, a hundred baths of wine, a hundred baths of olive oil, and salt without limit.
15Ezr 7:23 Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and of his sons?
15Ezr 7:24 You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God.
15Ezr 7:25 And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom of your God, which you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people of Trans-Euphrates--all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach any who do not know them.
15Ezr 7:26 Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
15Ezr 7:27 Praise be to the LORD, the God of our fathers, who has put it into the king's heart to bring honor to the house of the LORD in Jerusalem in this way
15Ezr 7:28 and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king's powerful officials. Because the hand of the LORD my God was on me, I took courage and gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.
15Ezr 8:1 These are the family heads and those registered with them who came up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes£º
15Ezr 8:2 of the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom; of the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; of the descendants of David, Hattush
15Ezr 8:3 of the descendants of Shecaniah; of the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered 150 men;
15Ezr 8:4 of the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 men;
15Ezr 8:5 of the descendants of Zattu, Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 men;
15Ezr 8:6 of the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 men;
15Ezr 8:7 of the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 men;
15Ezr 8:8 of the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 men;
15Ezr 8:9 of the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 men;
15Ezr 8:10 of the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 men;
15Ezr 8:11 of the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 men;
15Ezr 8:12 of the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 men;
15Ezr 8:13 of the descendants of Adonikam, the last ones, whose names were Eliphelet, Jeuel and Shemaiah, and with them 60 men;
15Ezr 8:14 of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them 70 men.
15Ezr 8:15 I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there.
15Ezr 8:16 So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning,
15Ezr 8:17 and I sent them to Iddo, the leader in Casiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his kinsmen, the temple servants in Casiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God.
15Ezr 8:18 Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah's sons and brothers, 18 men;
15Ezr 8:19 and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 men.
15Ezr 8:20 They also brought 220 of the temple servants--a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name.
15Ezr 8:21 There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions.
15Ezr 8:22 I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him."
15Ezr 8:23 So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.
15Ezr 8:24 Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, together with Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers,
15Ezr 8:25 and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God.
15Ezr 8:26 I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold,
15Ezr 8:27 20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics, and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.
15Ezr 8:28 I said to them, "You as well as these articles are consecrated to the LORD. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.
15Ezr 8:29 Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the LORD in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel."
15Ezr 8:30 Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 8:31 On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way.
15Ezr 8:32 So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days.
15Ezr 8:33 On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.
15Ezr 8:34 Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.
15Ezr 8:35 Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel£º twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering, twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the LORD.
15Ezr 8:36 They also delivered the king's orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God.
15Ezr 9:1 After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, "The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices, like those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians and Amorites.
15Ezr 9:2 They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them. And the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness."
15Ezr 9:3 When I heard this, I tore my tunic and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled.
15Ezr 9:4 Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles. And I sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice.
15Ezr 9:5 Then, at the evening sacrifice, I rose from my self-abasement, with my tunic and cloak torn, and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the LORD my God
15Ezr 9:6 and prayed£º "O my God, I am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you, my God, because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens.
15Ezr 9:7 From the days of our forefathers until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity, to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings, as it is today.
15Ezr 9:8 "But now, for a brief moment, the LORD our God has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary, and so our God gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage.
15Ezr 9:9 Though we are slaves, our God has not deserted us in our bondage. He has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of Persia£º He has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our God and repair its ruins, and he has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.
15Ezr 9:10 "But now, O our God, what can we say after this? For we have disregarded the commands
15Ezr 9:11 you gave through your servants the prophets when you said£º 'The land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples. By their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other.
15Ezr 9:12 Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons. Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time, that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance.'
15Ezr 9:13 "What has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt, and yet, our God, you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this.
15Ezr 9:14 Shall we again break your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices? Would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us, leaving us no remnant or survivor?
15Ezr 9:15 O LORD, God of Israel, you are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we are before you in our guilt, though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence."
15Ezr 10:1 While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites--men, women and children--gathered around him. They too wept bitterly.
15Ezr 10:2 Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel.
15Ezr 10:3 Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.
15Ezr 10:4 Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it."
15Ezr 10:5 So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath.
15Ezr 10:6 Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.
15Ezr 10:7 A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 10:8 Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
15Ezr 10:9 Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain.
15Ezr 10:10 Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel's guilt.
15Ezr 10:11 Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives."
15Ezr 10:12 The whole assembly responded with a loud voice£º "You are right! We must do as you say.
15Ezr 10:13 But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing.
15Ezr 10:14 Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us."
15Ezr 10:15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this.
15Ezr 10:16 So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases,
15Ezr 10:17 and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.
15Ezr 10:18 Among the descendants of the priests, the following had married foreign women£º From the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak, and his brothers£º Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah.
15Ezr 10:19 (They all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives, and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering.)

15Ezr 10:29 From the descendants of Bani£º Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal and Jeremoth.
15Ezr 10:30 From the descendants of Pahath-Moab£º Adna, Kelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and Manasseh.
15Ezr 10:31 From the descendants of Harim£º Eliezer, Ishijah, Malkijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,

15Ezr 10:42 Shallum, Amariah and Joseph.
15Ezr 10:43 From the descendants of Nebo£º Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel and Benaiah.
15Ezr 10:44 All these had married foreign women, and some of them had children by these wives.
16
16Neh 1:1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah£º In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,
16Neh 1:2 Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem.
16Neh 1:3 They said to me, "Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire."
16Neh 1:4 When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.
16Neh 1:5 Then I said£º "O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands,
16Neh 1:6 let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's house, have committed against you.
16Neh 1:7 We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.
16Neh 1:8 "Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,
16Neh 1:9 but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.'
16Neh 1:10 "They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand.
16Neh 1:11 O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man." I was cupbearer to the king.
16Neh 2:1 In the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was brought for him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before;
16Neh 2:2 so the king asked me, "Why does your face look so sad when you are not ill? This can be nothing but sadness of heart." I was very much afraid,
16Neh 2:3 but I said to the king, "May the king live forever! Why should my face not look sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"
16Neh 2:4 The king said to me, "What is it you want?" Then I prayed to the God of heaven,
16Neh 2:5 and I answered the king, "If it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can rebuild it."
16Neh 2:6 Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, "How long will your journey take, and when will you get back?" It pleased the king to send me; so I set a time.
16Neh 2:7 I also said to him, "If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, so that they will provide me safe-conduct until I arrive in Judah?
16Neh 2:8 And may I have a letter to Asaph, keeper of the king's forest, so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence I will occupy?" And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.
16Neh 2:9 So I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king's letters. The king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me.
16Neh 2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.
16Neh 2:11 I went to Jerusalem, and after staying there three days
16Neh 2:12 I set out during the night with a few men. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There were no mounts with me except the one I was riding on.
16Neh 2:13 By night I went out through the Valley Gate toward the Jackal Well and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been destroyed by fire.
16Neh 2:14 Then I moved on toward the Fountain Gate and the King's Pool, but there was not enough room for my mount to get through;
16Neh 2:15 so I went up the valley by night, examining the wall. Finally, I turned back and reentered through the Valley Gate.
16Neh 2:16 The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work.
16Neh 2:17 Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in£º Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be in disgrace."
16Neh 2:18 I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me and what the king had said to me. They replied, "Let us start rebuilding." So they began this good work.
16Neh 2:19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. "What is this you are doing?" they asked. "Are you rebelling against the king?"
16Neh 2:20 I answered them by saying, "The God of heaven will give us success. We his servants will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share in Jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it."
16Neh 3:1 Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set its doors in place, building as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and as far as the Tower of Hananel.
16Neh 3:2 The men of Jericho built the adjoining section, and Zaccur son of Imri built next to them.
16Neh 3:3 The Fish Gate was rebuilt by the sons of Hassenaah. They laid its beams and put its doors and bolts and bars in place.
16Neh 3:4 Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired the next section. Next to him Meshullam son of Berekiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs, and next to him Zadok son of Baana also made repairs.
16Neh 3:5 The next section was repaired by the men of Tekoa, but their nobles would not put their shoulders to the work under their supervisors.
16Neh 3:6 The Jeshanah Gate was repaired by Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah. They laid its beams and put its doors and bolts and bars in place.
16Neh 3:7 Next to them, repairs were made by men from Gibeon and Mizpah--Melatiah of Gibeon and Jadon of Meronoth--places under the authority of the governor of Trans-Euphrates.
16Neh 3:8 Uzziel son of Harhaiah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired the next section; and Hananiah, one of the perfume-makers, made repairs next to that. They restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.
16Neh 3:9 Rephaiah son of Hur, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section.
16Neh 3:10 Adjoining this, Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his house, and Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs next to him.
16Neh 3:11 Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens.
16Neh 3:12 Shallum son of Hallohesh, ruler of a half-district of Jerusalem, repaired the next section with the help of his daughters.
16Neh 3:13 The Valley Gate was repaired by Hanun and the residents of Zanoah. They rebuilt it and put its doors and bolts and bars in place. They also repaired five hundred yards of the wall as far as the Dung Gate.
16Neh 3:14 The Dung Gate was repaired by Malkijah son of Recab, ruler of the district of Beth Hakkerem. He rebuilt it and put its doors and bolts and bars in place.
16Neh 3:15 The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallun son of Col-Hozeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah. He rebuilt it, roofing it over and putting its doors and bolts and bars in place. He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Siloam, by the King's Garden, as far as the steps going down from the City of David.
16Neh 3:16 Beyond him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of a half-district of Beth Zur, made repairs up to a point opposite the tombs of David, as far as the artificial pool and the House of the Heroes.
16Neh 3:17 Next to him, the repairs were made by the Levites under Rehum son of Bani. Beside him, Hashabiah, ruler of half the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his district.
16Neh 3:18 Next to him, the repairs were made by their countrymen under Binnui son of Henadad, ruler of the other half-district of Keilah.
16Neh 3:19 Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, repaired another section, from a point facing the ascent to the armory as far as the angle.
16Neh 3:20 Next to him, Baruch son of Zabbai zealously repaired another section, from the angle to the entrance of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
16Neh 3:21 Next to him, Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired another section, from the entrance of Eliashib's house to the end of it.
16Neh 3:22 The repairs next to him were made by the priests from the surrounding region.
16Neh 3:23 Beyond them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their house; and next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his house.
16Neh 3:24 Next to him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section, from Azariah's house to the angle and the corner,
16Neh 3:25 and Palal son of Uzai worked opposite the angle and the tower projecting from the upper palace near the court of the guard. Next to him, Pedaiah son of Parosh
16Neh 3:26 and the temple servants living on the hill of Ophel made repairs up to a point opposite the Water Gate toward the east and the projecting tower.
16Neh 3:27 Next to them, the men of Tekoa repaired another section, from the great projecting tower to the wall of Ophel.
16Neh 3:28 Above the Horse Gate, the priests made repairs, each in front of his own house.
16Neh 3:29 Next to them, Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. Next to him, Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the guard at the East Gate, made repairs.
16Neh 3:30 Next to him, Hananiah son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section. Next to them, Meshullam son of Berekiah made repairs opposite his living quarters.
16Neh 3:31 Next to him, Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs as far as the house of the temple servants and the merchants, opposite the Inspection Gate, and as far as the room above the corner;
16Neh 3:32 and between the room above the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs.
16Neh 4:1 When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became angry and was greatly incensed. He ridiculed the Jews,
16Neh 4:2 and in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, he said, "What are those feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Will they finish in a day? Can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble--burned as they are?"
16Neh 4:3 Tobiah the Ammonite, who was at his side, said, "What they are building--if even a fox climbed up on it, he would break down their wall of stones!"
16Neh 4:4 Hear us, O our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads. Give them over as plunder in a land of captivity.
16Neh 4:5 Do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight, for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders.
16Neh 4:6 So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart.
16Neh 4:7 But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the men of Ashdod heard that the repairs to Jerusalem's walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed, they were very angry.
16Neh 4:8 They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and stir up trouble against it.
16Neh 4:9 But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.
16Neh 4:10 Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, "The strength of the laborers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall."
16Neh 4:11 Also our enemies said, "Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work."
16Neh 4:12 Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, "Wherever you turn, they will attack us."
16Neh 4:13 Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families, with their swords, spears and bows.
16Neh 4:14 After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "Don't be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes."
16Neh 4:15 When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to his own work.
16Neh 4:16 From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows and armor. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah
16Neh 4:17 who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other,
16Neh 4:18 and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.
16Neh 4:19 Then I said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, "The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.
16Neh 4:20 Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!"
16Neh 4:21 So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out.
16Neh 4:22 At that time I also said to the people, "Have every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve us as guards by night and workmen by day."
16Neh 4:23 Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each had his weapon, even when he went for water.
16Neh 5:1 Now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their Jewish brothers.
16Neh 5:2 Some were saying, "We and our sons and daughters are numerous; in order for us to eat and stay alive, we must get grain."
16Neh 5:3 Others were saying, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine."
16Neh 5:4 Still others were saying, "We have had to borrow money to pay the king's tax on our fields and vineyards.
16Neh 5:5 Although we are of the same flesh and blood as our countrymen and though our sons are as good as theirs, yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery. Some of our daughters have already been enslaved, but we are powerless, because our fields and our vineyards belong to others."
16Neh 5:6 When I heard their outcry and these charges, I was very angry.
16Neh 5:7 I pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials. I told them, "You are exacting usury from your own countrymen!" So I called together a large meeting to deal with them
16Neh 5:8 and said£º "As far as possible, we have bought back our Jewish brothers who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your brothers, only for them to be sold back to us!" They kept quiet, because they could find nothing to say.
16Neh 5:9 So I continued, "What you are doing is not right. Shouldn't you walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?
16Neh 5:10 I and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain. But let the exacting of usury stop!
16Neh 5:11 Give back to them immediately their fields, vineyards, olive groves and houses, and also the usury you are charging them--the hundredth part of the money, grain, new wine and oil."
16Neh 5:12 "We will give it back," they said. "And we will not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say." Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised.
16Neh 5:13 I also shook out the folds of my robe and said, "In this way may God shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise. So may such a man be shaken out and emptied!" At this the whole assembly said, "Amen," and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.
16Neh 5:14 Moreover, from the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, until his thirty-second year--twelve years--neither I nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor.
16Neh 5:15 But the earlier governors--those preceding me--placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine. Their assistants also lorded it over the people. But out of reverence for God I did not act like that.
16Neh 5:16 Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were assembled there for the work; we did not acquire any land.
16Neh 5:17 Furthermore, a hundred and fifty Jews and officials ate at my table, as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations.
16Neh 5:18 Each day one ox, six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds. In spite of all this, I never demanded the food allotted to the governor, because the demands were heavy on these people.
16Neh 5:19 Remember me with favor, O my God, for all I have done for these people.
16Neh 6:1 When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it--though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates--
16Neh 6:2 Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message£º "Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono." But they were scheming to harm me;
16Neh 6:3 so I sent messengers to them with this reply£º "I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?"
16Neh 6:4 Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer.
16Neh 6:5 Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter
16Neh 6:6 in which was written£º "It is reported among the nations--and Geshem says it is true--that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king
16Neh 6:7 and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem£º 'There is a king in Judah!' Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us confer together."
16Neh 6:8 I sent him this reply£º "Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head."
16Neh 6:9 They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed." But I prayed,"Now strengthen my hands."
16Neh 6:10 One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, "Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you--by night they are coming to kill you."
16Neh 6:11 But I said, "Should a man like me run away? Or should one like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!"
16Neh 6:12 I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
16Neh 6:13 He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me.
16Neh 6:14 Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me.
16Neh 6:15 So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.
16Neh 6:16 When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God.
16Neh 6:17 Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them.
16Neh 6:18 For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.
16Neh 6:19 Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
16Neh 7:1 After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers and the singers and the Levites were appointed.
16Neh 7:2 I put in charge of Jerusalem my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah the commander of the citadel, because he was a man of integrity and feared God more than most men do.
16Neh 7:3 I said to them, "The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut the doors and bar them. Also appoint residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some near their own houses."
16Neh 7:4 Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.
16Neh 7:5 So my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials and the common people for registration by families. I found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return. This is what I found written there£º
16Neh 7:6 These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken captive (they returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town,
16Neh 7:7 in company with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum and Baanah)£º The list of the men of Israel£º

16Neh 7:60 The temple servants and the descendants of the servants of Solomon 392
16Neh 7:61 The following came up from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon and Immer, but they could not show that their families were descended from Israel£º
16Neh 7:62 the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah and Nekoda 642
16Neh 7:63 And from among the priests£º the descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz and Barzillai (a man who had married a daughter of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by that name).
16Neh 7:64 These searched for their family records, but they could not find them and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.
16Neh 7:65 The governor, therefore, ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there should be a priest ministering with the Urim and Thummim.
16Neh 7:66 The whole company numbered 42,360,
16Neh 7:67 besides their 7,337 menservants and maidservants; and they also had 245 men and women singers.
16Neh 7:68 There were 736 horses, 245 mules,
16Neh 7:69 435 camels and 6,720 donkeys.
16Neh 7:70 Some of the heads of the families contributed to the work. The governor gave to the treasury 1,000 drachmas of gold, 50 bowls and 530 garments for priests.
16Neh 7:71 Some of the heads of the families gave to the treasury for the work 20,000 drachmas of gold and 2,200 minas of silver.
16Neh 7:72 The total given by the rest of the people was 20,000 drachmas of gold, 2,000 minas of silver and 67 garments for priests.
16Neh 7:73 The priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers and the temple servants, along with certain of the people and the rest of the Israelites, settled in their own towns. When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns,
16Neh 8:1 all the people assembled as one man in the square before the Water Gate. They told Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded for Israel.
16Neh 8:2 So on the first day of the seventh month Ezra the priest brought the Law before the assembly, which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand.
16Neh 8:3 He read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the Water Gate in the presence of the men, women and others who could understand. And all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.
16Neh 8:4 Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion. Beside him on his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; and on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah and Meshullam.
16Neh 8:5 Ezra opened the book. All the people could see him because he was standing above them; and as he opened it, the people all stood up.
16Neh 8:6 Ezra praised the LORD, the great God; and all the people lifted their hands and responded, "Amen! Amen!" Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
16Neh 8:7 The Levites--Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan and Pelaiah--instructed the people in the Law while the people were standing there.
16Neh 8:8 They read from the Book of the Law of God, making it clear and giving the meaning so that the people could understand what was being read.
16Neh 8:9 Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were instructing the people said to them all, "This day is sacred to the LORD your God. Do not mourn or weep." For all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law.
16Neh 8:10 Nehemiah said, "Go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks, and send some to those who have nothing prepared. This day is sacred to our Lord. Do not grieve, for the joy of the LORD is your strength."
16Neh 8:11 The Levites calmed all the people, saying, "Be still, for this is a sacred day. Do not grieve."
16Neh 8:12 Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy, because they now understood the words that had been made known to them.
16Neh 8:13 On the second day of the month, the heads of all the families, along with the priests and the Levites, gathered around Ezra the scribe to give attention to the words of the Law.
16Neh 8:14 They found written in the Law, which the LORD had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in booths during the feast of the seventh month
16Neh 8:15 and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem£º "Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms and shade trees, to make booths"--as it is written.
16Neh 8:16 So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves booths on their own roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim.
16Neh 8:17 The whole company that had returned from exile built booths and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated it like this. And their joy was very great.
16Neh 8:18 Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the feast for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the regulation, there was an assembly.
16Neh 9:1 On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and having dust on their heads.
16Neh 9:2 Those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the wickedness of their fathers.
16Neh 9:3 They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the LORD their God for a quarter of the day, and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the LORD their God.
16Neh 9:4 Standing on the stairs were the Levites--Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Kenani--who called with loud voices to the LORD their God.
16Neh 9:5 And the Levites--Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah--said£º "Stand up and praise the LORD your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting." "Blessed be your glorious name, and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.
16Neh 9:6 You alone are the LORD. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the multitudes of heaven worship you.
16Neh 9:7 "You are the LORD God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham.
16Neh 9:8 You found his heart faithful to you, and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites and Girgashites. You have kept your promise because you are righteous.
16Neh 9:9 "You saw the suffering of our forefathers in Egypt; you heard their cry at the Red Sea.
16Neh 9:10 You sent miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day.
16Neh 9:11 You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters.
16Neh 9:12 By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take.
16Neh 9:13 "You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands that are good.
16Neh 9:14 You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees and laws through your servant Moses.
16Neh 9:15 In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock; you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them.
16Neh 9:16 "But they, our forefathers, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and did not obey your commands.
16Neh 9:17 They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them,
16Neh 9:18 even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, 'This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,' or when they committed awful blasphemies.
16Neh 9:19 "Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert. By day the pillar of cloud did not cease to guide them on their path, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take.
16Neh 9:20 You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst.
16Neh 9:21 For forty years you sustained them in the desert; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen.
16Neh 9:22 "You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers. They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon and the country of Og king of Bashan.
16Neh 9:23 You made their sons as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their fathers to enter and possess.
16Neh 9:24 Their sons went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you handed the Canaanites over to them, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased.
16Neh 9:25 They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness.
16Neh 9:26 "But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they put your law behind their backs. They killed your prophets, who had admonished them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies.
16Neh 9:27 So you handed them over to their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies.
16Neh 9:28 "But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion you delivered them time after time.
16Neh 9:29 "You warned them to return to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, by which a man will live if he obeys them. Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen.
16Neh 9:30 For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you admonished them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you handed them over to the neighboring peoples.
16Neh 9:31 But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God.
16Neh 9:32 "Now therefore, O our God, the great, mighty and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love, do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes--the hardship that has come upon us, upon our kings and leaders, upon our priests and prophets, upon our fathers and all your people, from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
16Neh 9:33 In all that has happened to us, you have been just; you have acted faithfully, while we did wrong.
16Neh 9:34 Our kings, our leaders, our priests and our fathers did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the warnings you gave them.
16Neh 9:35 Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways.
16Neh 9:36 "But see, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave our forefathers so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces.
16Neh 9:37 Because of our sins, its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please. We are in great distress.
16Neh 9:38 "In view of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, our Levites and our priests are affixing their seals to it."
16Neh 10:1 Those who sealed it were£º Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah. Zedekiah,

16Neh 10:26 Ahiah, Hanan, Anan,
16Neh 10:27 Malluch, Harim and Baanah.
16Neh 10:28 "The rest of the people--priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, temple servants and all who separated themselves from the neighboring peoples for the sake of the Law of God, together with their wives and all their sons and daughters who are able to understand--
16Neh 10:29 all these now join their brothers the nobles, and bind themselves with a curse and an oath to follow the Law of God given through Moses the servant of God and to obey carefully all the commands, regulations and decrees of the LORD our Lord.
16Neh 10:30 "We promise not to give our daughters in marriage to the peoples around us or take their daughters for our sons.
16Neh 10:31 "When the neighboring peoples bring merchandise or grain to sell on the Sabbath, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on any holy day. Every seventh year we will forgo working the land and will cancel all debts.
16Neh 10:32 "We assume the responsibility for carrying out the commands to give a third of a shekel each year for the service of the house of our God£º
16Neh 10:33 for the bread set out on the table; for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings; for the offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moon festivals and appointed feasts; for the holy offerings; for sin offerings to make atonement for Israel; and for all the duties of the house of our God.
16Neh 10:34 "We--the priests, the Levites and the people--have cast lots to determine when each of our families is to bring to the house of our God at set times each year a contribution of wood to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the Law.
16Neh 10:35 "We also assume responsibility for bringing to the house of the LORD each year the firstfruits of our crops and of every fruit tree.
16Neh 10:36 "As it is also written in the Law, we will bring the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle, of our herds and of our flocks to the house of our God, to the priests ministering there.
16Neh 10:37 "Moreover, we will bring to the storerooms of the house of our God, to the priests, the first of our ground meal, of our grain offerings, of the fruit of all our trees and of our new wine and oil. And we will bring a tithe of our crops to the Levites, for it is the Levites who collect the tithes in all the towns where we work.
16Neh 10:38 A priest descended from Aaron is to accompany the Levites when they receive the tithes, and the Levites are to bring a tenth of the tithes up to the house of our God, to the storerooms of the treasury.
16Neh 10:39 The people of Israel, including the Levites, are to bring their contributions of grain, new wine and oil to the storerooms where the articles for the sanctuary are kept and where the ministering priests, the gatekeepers and the singers stay. "We will not neglect the house of our God."
16Neh 11:1 Now the leaders of the people settled in Jerusalem, and the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of every ten to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the remaining nine were to stay in their own towns.
16Neh 11:2 The people commended all the men who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
16Neh 11:3 These are the provincial leaders who settled in Jerusalem (now some Israelites, priests, Levites, temple servants and descendants of Solomon's servants lived in the towns of Judah, each on his own property in the various towns,
16Neh 11:4 while other people from both Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem)£º From the descendants of Judah£º Athaiah son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel, a descendant of Perez;
16Neh 11:5 and Maaseiah son of Baruch, the son of Col-Hozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, a descendant of Shelah.
16Neh 11:6 The descendants of Perez who lived in Jerusalem totaled 468 able men.

16Neh 11:9 Joel son of Zicri was their chief officer, and Judah son of Hassenuah was over the Second District of the city.
16Neh 11:10 From the priests£º Jedaiah; the son of Joiarib; Jakin;
16Neh 11:11 Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, supervisor in the house of God,

16Neh 11:13 and his associates, who were heads of families--242 men; Amashsai son of Azarel, the son of Ahzai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
16Neh 11:14 and his associates, who were able men--128. Their chief officer was Zabdiel son of Haggedolim.
16Neh 11:15 From the Levites£º Shemaiah son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
16Neh 11:16 Shabbethai and Jozabad, two of the heads of the Levites, who had charge of the outside work of the house of God;

16Neh 11:18 The Levites in the holy city totaled 284.
16Neh 11:19 The gatekeepers£º Akkub, Talmon and their associates, who kept watch at the gates--172 men.
16Neh 11:20 The rest of the Israelites, with the priests and Levites, were in all the towns of Judah, each on his ancestral property.
16Neh 11:21 The temple servants lived on the hill of Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of them.
16Neh 11:22 The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Mica. Uzzi was one of Asaph's descendants, who were the singers responsible for the service of the house of God.
16Neh 11:23 The singers were under the king's orders, which regulated their daily activity.
16Neh 11:24 Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, one of the descendants of Zerah son of Judah, was the king's agent in all affairs relating to the people.
16Neh 11:25 As for the villages with their fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath Arba and its surrounding settlements, in Dibon and its settlements, in Jekabzeel and its villages,
16Neh 11:26 in Jeshua, in Moladah, in Beth Pelet,
16Neh 11:27 in Hazar Shual, in Beersheba and its settlements,
16Neh 11:28 in Ziklag, in Meconah and its settlements,
16Neh 11:29 in En Rimmon, in Zorah, in Jarmuth,
16Neh 11:30 Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, in Lachish and its fields, and in Azekah and its settlements. So they were living all the way from Beersheba to the Valley of Hinnom.
16Neh 11:31 The descendants of the Benjamites from Geba lived in Micmash, Aija, Bethel and its settlements,
16Neh 11:32 in Anathoth, Nob and Ananiah,
16Neh 11:33 in Hazor, Ramah and Gittaim,
16Neh 11:34 in Hadid, Zeboim and Neballat,
16Neh 11:35 in Lod and Ono, and in the Valley of the Craftsmen.
16Neh 11:36 Some of the divisions of the Levites of Judah settled in Benjamin.
16Neh 12:1 These were the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and with Jeshua£º Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
16Neh 12:2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
16Neh 12:3 Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
16Neh 12:4 Iddo, Ginnethon, Abijah,
16Neh 12:5 Mijamin, Moadiah, Bilgah,
16Neh 12:6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
16Neh 12:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua.
16Neh 12:8 The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and also Mattaniah, who, together with his associates, was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving.
16Neh 12:9 Bakbukiah and Unni, their associates, stood opposite them in the services.
16Neh 12:10 Jeshua was the father of Joiakim, Joiakim the father of Eliashib, Eliashib the father of Joiada,
16Neh 12:11 Joiada the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan the father of Jaddua.
16Neh 12:12 In the days of Joiakim, these were the heads of the priestly families£º of Seraiah's family, Meraiah; of Jeremiah's, Hananiah;
16Neh 12:13 of Ezra's, Meshullam; of Amariah's, Jehohanan;
16Neh 12:14 of Malluch's, Jonathan; of Shecaniah's, Joseph;
16Neh 12:15 of Harim's, Adna; of Meremoth's, Helkai;
16Neh 12:16 of Iddo's, Zechariah; of Ginnethon's, Meshullam;
16Neh 12:17 of Abijah's, Zicri; of Miniamin's and of Moadiah's, Piltai;
16Neh 12:18 of Bilgah's, Shammua; of Shemaiah's, Jehonathan;
16Neh 12:19 of Joiarib's, Mattenai; of Jedaiah's, Uzzi;
16Neh 12:20 of Sallu's, Kallai; of Amok's, Eber;
16Neh 12:21 of Hilkiah's, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah's, Nethanel.
16Neh 12:22 The family heads of the Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, as well as those of the priests, were recorded in the reign of Darius the Persian.
16Neh 12:23 The family heads among the descendants of Levi up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib were recorded in the book of the annals.
16Neh 12:24 And the leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their associates, who stood opposite them to give praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, as prescribed by David the man of God.
16Neh 12:25 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms at the gates.
16Neh 12:26 They served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe.
16Neh 12:27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, the Levites were sought out from where they lived and were brought to Jerusalem to celebrate joyfully the dedication with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps and lyres.
16Neh 12:28 The singers also were brought together from the region around Jerusalem--from the villages of the Netophathites,
16Neh 12:29 from Beth Gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem.
16Neh 12:30 When the priests and Levites had purified themselves ceremonially, they purified the people, the gates and the wall.
16Neh 12:31 I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall. I also assigned two large choirs to give thanks. One was to proceed on top of the wall to the right, toward the Dung Gate.
16Neh 12:32 Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them,
16Neh 12:33 along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
16Neh 12:34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,
16Neh 12:35 as well as some priests with trumpets, and also Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,
16Neh 12:36 and his associates--Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah and Hanani--with musical instruments prescribed by David the man of God. Ezra the scribe led the procession.
16Neh 12:37 At the Fountain Gate they continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall and passed above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
16Neh 12:38 The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction. I followed them on top of the wall, together with half the people--past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall,
16Neh 12:39 over the Gate of Ephraim, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. At the Gate of the Guard they stopped.
16Neh 12:40 The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials,
16Neh 12:41 as well as the priests--Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah with their trumpets--
16Neh 12:42 and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah.
16Neh 12:43 And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away.
16Neh 12:44 At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites.
16Neh 12:45 They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon.
16Neh 12:46 For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.
16Neh 12:47 So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.
16Neh 13:1 On that day the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God,
16Neh 13:2 because they had not met the Israelites with food and water but had hired Balaam to call a curse down on them. (Our God, however, turned the curse into a blessing.)
16Neh 13:3 When the people heard this law, they excluded from Israel all who were of foreign descent.
16Neh 13:4 Before this, Eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our God. He was closely associated with Tobiah,
16Neh 13:5 and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles, and also the tithes of grain, new wine and oil prescribed for the Levites, singers and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests.
16Neh 13:6 But while all this was going on, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had returned to the king. Some time later I asked his permission
16Neh 13:7 and came back to Jerusalem. Here I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done in providing Tobiah a room in the courts of the house of God.
16Neh 13:8 I was greatly displeased and threw all Tobiah's household goods out of the room.
16Neh 13:9 I gave orders to purify the rooms, and then I put back into them the equipment of the house of God, with the grain offerings and the incense.
16Neh 13:10 I also learned that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them, and that all the Levites and singers responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields.
16Neh 13:11 So I rebuked the officials and asked them, "Why is the house of God neglected?" Then I called them together and stationed them at their posts.
16Neh 13:12 All Judah brought the tithes of grain, new wine and oil into the storerooms.
16Neh 13:13 I put Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because these men were considered trustworthy. They were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their brothers.
16Neh 13:14 Remember me for this, O my God, and do not blot out what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services.
16Neh 13:15 In those days I saw men in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys, together with wine, grapes, figs and all other kinds of loads. And they were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. Therefore I warned them against selling food on that day.
16Neh 13:16 Men from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in Jerusalem on the Sabbath to the people of Judah.
16Neh 13:17 I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this wicked thing you are doing--desecrating the Sabbath day?
16Neh 13:18 Didn't your forefathers do the same things, so that our God brought all this calamity upon us and upon this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath."
16Neh 13:19 When evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day.
16Neh 13:20 Once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem.
16Neh 13:21 But I warned them and said, "Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will lay hands on you." From that time on they no longer came on the Sabbath.
16Neh 13:22 Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, O my God, and show mercy to me according to your great love.
16Neh 13:23 Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.
16Neh 13:24 Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah.
16Neh 13:25 I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God's name and said£º "You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves.
16Neh 13:26 Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women.
16Neh 13:27 Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?"
16Neh 13:28 One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I drove him away from me.
16Neh 13:29 Remember them, O my God, because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
16Neh 13:30 So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned them duties, each to his own task.
16Neh 13:31 I also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me with favor, O my God.

17Est 1:1 This is what happened during the time of Xerxes, the Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush£º
17Est 1:2 At that time King Xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of Susa,
17Est 1:3 and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. The military leaders of Persia and Media, the princes, and the nobles of the provinces were present.
17Est 1:4 For a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty.
17Est 1:5 When these days were over, the king gave a banquet, lasting seven days, in the enclosed garden of the king's palace, for all the people from the least to the greatest, who were in the citadel of Susa.
17Est 1:6 The garden had hangings of white and blue linen, fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other costly stones.
17Est 1:7 Wine was served in goblets of gold, each one different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant, in keeping with the king's liberality.
17Est 1:8 By the king's command each guest was allowed to drink in his own way, for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished.
17Est 1:9 Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
17Est 1:10 On the seventh day, when King Xerxes was in high spirits from wine, he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him--Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carcas--
17Est 1:11 to bring before him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown, in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles, for she was lovely to look at.
17Est 1:12 But when the attendants delivered the king's command, Queen Vashti refused to come. Then the king became furious and burned with anger.
17Est 1:13 Since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice, he spoke with the wise men who understood the times
17Est 1:14 and were closest to the king--Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.
17Est 1:15 "According to law, what must be done to Queen Vashti?" he asked. "She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her."
17Est 1:16 Then Memucan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, "Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of King Xerxes.
17Est 1:17 For the queen's conduct will become known to all the women, and so they will despise their husbands and say, 'King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she would not come.'
17Est 1:18 This very day the Persian and Median women of the nobility who have heard about the queen's conduct will respond to all the king's nobles in the same way. There will be no end of disrespect and discord.
17Est 1:19 "Therefore, if it pleases the king, let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she.
17Est 1:20 Then when the king's edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm, all the women will respect their husbands, from the least to the greatest."
17Est 1:21 The king and his nobles were pleased with this advice, so the king did as Memucan proposed.
17Est 1:22 He sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language, proclaiming in each people's tongue that every man should be ruler over his own household.
17Est 2:1 Later when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her.
17Est 2:2 Then the king's personal attendants proposed, "Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.
17Est 2:3 Let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful girls into the harem at the citadel of Susa. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be given to them.
17Est 2:4 Then let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." This advice appealed to the king, and he followed it.
17Est 2:5 Now there was in the citadel of Susa a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin, named Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish,
17Est 2:6 who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jehoiachin king of Judah.
17Est 2:7 Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This girl, who was also known as Esther, was lovely in form and features, and Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.
17Est 2:8 When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed, many girls were brought to the citadel of Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king's palace and entrusted to Hegai, who had charge of the harem.
17Est 2:9 The girl pleased him and won his favor. Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven maids selected from the king's palace and moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.
17Est 2:10 Esther had not revealed her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.
17Est 2:11 Every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.
17Est 2:12 Before a girl's turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics.
17Est 2:13 And this is how she would go to the king£º Anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.
17Est 2:14 In the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.
17Est 2:15 When the turn came for Esther (the girl Mordecai had adopted, the daughter of his uncle Abihail) to go to the king, she asked for nothing other than what Hegai, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther won the favor of everyone who saw her.
17Est 2:16 She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
17Est 2:17 Now the king was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women, and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
17Est 2:18 And the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
17Est 2:19 When the virgins were assembled a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
17Est 2:20 But Esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as Mordecai had told her to do, for she continued to follow Mordecai's instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up.
17Est 2:21 During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
17Est 2:22 But Mordecai found out about the plot and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.
17Est 2:23 And when the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were hanged on a gallows. All this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king.
17Est 3:1 After these events, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles.
17Est 3:2 All the royal officials at the king's gate knelt down and paid honor to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor.
17Est 3:3 Then the royal officials at the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why do you disobey the king's command?"
17Est 3:4 Day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply. Therefore they told Haman about it to see whether Mordecai's behavior would be tolerated, for he had told them he was a Jew.
17Est 3:5 When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor, he was enraged.
17Est 3:6 Yet having learned who Mordecai's people were, he scorned the idea of killing only Mordecai. Instead Haman looked for a way to destroy all Mordecai's people, the Jews, throughout the whole kingdom of Xerxes.
17Est 3:7 In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, they cast the pur (that is, the lot) in the presence of Haman to select a day and month. And the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar.
17Est 3:8 Then Haman said to King Xerxes, "There is a certain people dispersed and scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose customs are different from those of all other people and who do not obey the king's laws; it is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them.
17Est 3:9 If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will put ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury for the men who carry out this business."
17Est 3:10 So the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
17Est 3:11 "Keep the money," the king said to Haman, "and do with the people as you please."
17Est 3:12 Then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned. They wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all Haman's orders to the king's satraps, the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples. These were written in the name of King Xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring.
17Est 3:13 Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces with the order to destroy, kill and annihilate all the Jews--young and old, women and little children--on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.
17Est 3:14 A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day.
17Est 3:15 Spurred on by the king's command, the couriers went out, and the edict was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.
17Est 4:1 When Mordecai learned of all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.
17Est 4:2 But he went only as far as the king's gate, because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it.
17Est 4:3 In every province to which the edict and order of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping and wailing. Many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
17Est 4:4 When Esther's maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she was in great distress. She sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.
17Est 4:5 Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs assigned to attend her, and ordered him to find out what was troubling Mordecai and why.
17Est 4:6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate.
17Est 4:7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.
17Est 4:8 He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and explain it to her, and he told him to urge her to go into the king's presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people.
17Est 4:9 Hathach went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said.
17Est 4:10 Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai,
17Est 4:11 "All the king's officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law£º that he be put to death. The only exception to this is for the king to extend the gold scepter to him and spare his life. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king."
17Est 4:12 When Esther's words were reported to Mordecai,
17Est 4:13 he sent back this answer£º "Do not think that because you are in the king's house you alone of all the Jews will escape.
17Est 4:14 For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?"
17Est 4:15 Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai£º
17Est 4:16 "Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish."
17Est 4:17 So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther's instructions.
17Est 5:1 On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace, in front of the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the entrance.
17Est 5:2 When he saw Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand. So Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
17Est 5:3 Then the king asked, "What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be given you."
17Est 5:4 "If it pleases the king," replied Esther, "let the king, together with Haman, come today to a banquet I have prepared for him."
17Est 5:5 "Bring Haman at once," the king said, "so that we may do what Esther asks." So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17Est 5:6 As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther, "Now what is your petition? It will be given you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted."
17Est 5:7 Esther replied, "My petition and my request is this£º
17Est 5:8 If the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king's question."
17Est 5:9 Haman went out that day happy and in high spirits. But when he saw Mordecai at the king's gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence, he was filled with rage against Mordecai.
17Est 5:10 Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home. Calling together his friends and Zeresh, his wife,
17Est 5:11 Haman boasted to them about his vast wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials.
17Est 5:12 "And that's not all," Haman added. "I'm the only person Queen Esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave. And she has invited me along with the king tomorrow.
17Est 5:13 But all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king's gate."
17Est 5:14 His wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, "Have a gallows built, seventy-five feet high, and ask the king in the morning to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go with the king to the dinner and be happy." This suggestion delighted Haman, and he had the gallows built.
17Est 6:1 That night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him.
17Est 6:2 It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
17Est 6:3 "What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?" the king asked. "Nothing has been done for him," his attendants answered.
17Est 6:4 The king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had erected for him.
17Est 6:5 His attendants answered, "Haman is standing in the court." "Bring him in," the king ordered.
17Est 6:6 When Haman entered, the king asked him, "What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?" Now Haman thought to himself, "Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?"
17Est 6:7 So he answered the king, "For the man the king delights to honor,
17Est 6:8 have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head.
17Est 6:9 Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king's most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, 'This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!'"
17Est 6:10 "Go at once," the king commanded Haman. "Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended."
17Est 6:11 So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, "This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!"
17Est 6:12 Afterward Mordecai returned to the king's gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief,
17Est 6:13 and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, "Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him--you will surely come to ruin!"
17Est 6:14 While they were still talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17Est 7:1 So the king and Haman went to dine with Queen Esther,
17Est 7:2 and as they were drinking wine on that second day, the king again asked, "Queen Esther, what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be granted."
17Est 7:3 Then Queen Esther answered, "If I have found favor with you, O king, and if it pleases your majesty, grant me my life--this is my petition. And spare my people--this is my request.
17Est 7:4 For I and my people have been sold for destruction and slaughter and annihilation. If we had merely been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because no such distress would justify disturbing the king."
17Est 7:5 King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, "Who is he? Where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?"
17Est 7:6 Esther said, "The adversary and enemy is this vile Haman." Then Haman was terrified before the king and queen.
17Est 7:7 The king got up in a rage, left his wine and went out into the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.
17Est 7:8 Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining. The king exclaimed, "Will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house?" As soon as the word left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
17Est 7:9 Then Harbona, one of the eunuchs attending the king, said, "A gallows seventy-five feet high stands by Haman's house. He had it made for Mordecai, who spoke up to help the king." The king said, "Hang him on it!"
17Est 7:10 So they hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's fury subsided.
17Est 8:1 That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mordecai came into the presence of the king, for Esther had told how he was related to her.
17Est 8:2 The king took off his signet ring, which he had reclaimed from Haman, and presented it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed him over Haman's estate.
17Est 8:3 Esther again pleaded with the king, falling at his feet and weeping. She begged him to put an end to the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews.
17Est 8:4 Then the king extended the gold scepter to Esther and she arose and stood before him.
17Est 8:5 "If it pleases the king," she said, "and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do, and if he is pleased with me, let an order be written overruling the dispatches that Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, devised and wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king's provinces.
17Est 8:6 For how can I bear to see disaster fall on my people? How can I bear to see the destruction of my family?"
17Est 8:7 King Xerxes replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, "Because Haman attacked the Jews, I have given his estate to Esther, and they have hanged him on the gallows.
17Est 8:8 Now write another decree in the king's name in behalf of the Jews as seems best to you, and seal it with the king's signet ring--for no document written in the king's name and sealed with his ring can be revoked."
17Est 8:9 At once the royal secretaries were summoned--on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai's orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush. These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the Jews in their own script and language.
17Est 8:10 Mordecai wrote in the name of King Xerxes, sealed the dispatches with the king's signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king.
17Est 8:11 The king's edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves; to destroy, kill and annihilate any armed force of any nationality or province that might attack them and their women and children; and to plunder the property of their enemies.
17Est 8:12 The day appointed for the Jews to do this in all the provinces of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar.
17Est 8:13 A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.
17Est 8:14 The couriers, riding the royal horses, raced out, spurred on by the king's command. And the edict was also issued in the citadel of Susa.
17Est 8:15 Mordecai left the king's presence wearing royal garments of blue and white, a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen. And the city of Susa held a joyous celebration.
17Est 8:16 For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor.
17Est 8:17 In every province and in every city, wherever the edict of the king went, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. And many people of other nationalities became Jews because fear of the Jews had seized them.
17Est 9:1 On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them.
17Est 9:2 The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those seeking their destruction. No one could stand against them, because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them.
17Est 9:3 And all the nobles of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and the king's administrators helped the Jews, because fear of Mordecai had seized them.
17Est 9:4 Mordecai was prominent in the palace; his reputation spread throughout the provinces, and he became more and more powerful.
17Est 9:5 The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did what they pleased to those who hated them.
17Est 9:6 In the citadel of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.
17Est 9:7 They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
17Est 9:8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
17Est 9:9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai and Vaizatha,
17Est 9:10 he ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17Est 9:11 The number of those slain in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day.
17Est 9:12 The king said to Queen Esther, "The Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman in the citadel of Susa. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now what is your petition? It will be given you. What is your request? It will also be granted."
17Est 9:13 "If it pleases the king," Esther answered, "give the Jews in Susa permission to carry out this day's edict tomorrow also, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on gallows."
17Est 9:14 So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they hanged the ten sons of Haman.
17Est 9:15 The Jews in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they put to death in Susa three hundred men, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17Est 9:16 Meanwhile, the remainder of the Jews who were in the king's provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder.
17Est 9:17 This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
17Est 9:18 The Jews in Susa, however, had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth, and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.
17Est 9:19 That is why rural Jews--those living in villages--observe the fourteenth of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for giving presents to each other.
17Est 9:20 Mordecai recorded these events, and he sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, near and far,
17Est 9:21 to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar
17Est 9:22 as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration. He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor.
17Est 9:23 So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, doing what Mordecai had written to them.
17Est 9:24 For Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur (that is, the lot) for their ruin and destruction.
17Est 9:25 But when the plot came to the king's attention, he issued written orders that the evil scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should come back onto his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
17Est 9:26 (Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word pur .) Because of everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them,
17Est 9:27 the Jews took it upon themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days every year, in the way prescribed and at the time appointed.
17Est 9:28 These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family, and in every province and in every city. And these days of Purim should never cease to be celebrated by the Jews, nor should the memory of them die out among their descendants.
17Est 9:29 So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim.
17Est 9:30 And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Xerxes--words of goodwill and assurance--
17Est 9:31 to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation.
17Est 9:32 Esther's decree confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written down in the records.
17Est 10:1 King Xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire, to its distant shores.
17Est 10:2 And all his acts of power and might, together with a full account of the greatness of Mordecai to which the king had raised him, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Media and Persia?
17Est 10:3 Mordecai the Jew was second in rank to King Xerxes, preeminent among the Jews, and held in high esteem by his many fellow Jews, because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the Jews.
