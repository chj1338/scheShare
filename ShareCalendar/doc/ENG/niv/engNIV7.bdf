44
44Ac 1:1 In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and to teach
44Ac 1:2 until the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
44Ac 1:3 After his suffering, he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God.
44Ac 1:4 On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command£º "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.
44Ac 1:5 For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 1:6 So when they met together, they asked him, "Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"
44Ac 1:7 He said to them£º "It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.
44Ac 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
44Ac 1:9 After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.
44Ac 1:10 They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.
44Ac 1:11 "Men of Galilee," they said, "why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven."
44Ac 1:12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, a Sabbath day's walk from the city.
44Ac 1:13 When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.
44Ac 1:14 They all joined together constantly in prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.
44Ac 1:15 In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about a hundred and twenty)
44Ac 1:16 and said, "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who served as guide for those who arrested Jesus--
44Ac 1:17 he was one of our number and shared in this ministry."
44Ac 1:18 (With the reward he got for his wickedness, Judas bought a field; there he fell headlong, his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out.
44Ac 1:19 Everyone in Jerusalem heard about this, so they called that field in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
44Ac 1:20 "For," said Peter, "it is written in the book of Psalms, "'May his place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in it,' and, "'May another take his place of leadership.'
44Ac 1:21 Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
44Ac 1:22 beginning from John's baptism to the time when Jesus was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection."
44Ac 1:23 So they proposed two men£º Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.
44Ac 1:24 Then they prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen
44Ac 1:25 to take over this apostolic ministry, which Judas left to go where he belongs."
44Ac 1:26 Then they cast lots, and the lot fell to Matthias; so he was added to the eleven apostles.
44Ac 2:1 When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place.
44Ac 2:2 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
44Ac 2:3 They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them.
44Ac 2:4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
44Ac 2:5 Now there were staying in Jerusalem God-fearing Jews from every nation under heaven.
44Ac 2:6 When they heard this sound, a crowd came together in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.
44Ac 2:7 Utterly amazed, they asked£º "Are not all these men who are speaking Galileans?
44Ac 2:8 Then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language?
44Ac 2:9 Parthians, Medes and Elamites; residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
44Ac 2:10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome
44Ac 2:11 (both Jews and converts to Judaism); Cretans and Arabs--we hear them declaring the wonders of God in our own tongues!"
44Ac 2:12 Amazed and perplexed, they asked one another, "What does this mean?"
44Ac 2:13 Some, however, made fun of them and said, "They have had too much wine."
44Ac 2:14 Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd£º "Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say.
44Ac 2:15 These men are not drunk, as you suppose. It's only nine in the morning!
44Ac 2:16 No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel£º
44Ac 2:17 "'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.
44Ac 2:18 Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy.
44Ac 2:19 I will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and billows of smoke.
44Ac 2:20 The sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.
44Ac 2:21 And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'
44Ac 2:22 "Men of Israel, listen to this£º Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders and signs, which God did among you through him, as you yourselves know.
44Ac 2:23 This man was handed over to you by God's set purpose and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of wicked men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.
44Ac 2:24 But God raised him from the dead, freeing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him.
44Ac 2:25 David said about him£º "'I saw the Lord always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
44Ac 2:26 Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will live in hope,
44Ac 2:27 because you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your Holy One see decay.
44Ac 2:28 You have made known to me the paths of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence.'
44Ac 2:29 "Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.
44Ac 2:30 But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne.
44Ac 2:31 Seeing what was ahead, he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to the grave, nor did his body see decay.
44Ac 2:32 God has raised this Jesus to life, and we are all witnesses of the fact.
44Ac 2:33 Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear.
44Ac 2:34 For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said, "'The Lord said to my Lord£º "Sit at my right hand
44Ac 2:35 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet." '
44Ac 2:36 "Therefore let all Israel be assured of this£º God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."
44Ac 2:37 When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
44Ac 2:38 Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 2:39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off--for all whom the Lord our God will call."
44Ac 2:40 With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, "Save yourselves from this corrupt generation."
44Ac 2:41 Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
44Ac 2:42 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
44Ac 2:43 Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles.
44Ac 2:44 All the believers were together and had everything in common.
44Ac 2:45 Selling their possessions and goods, they gave to anyone as he had need.
44Ac 2:46 Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
44Ac 2:47 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
44Ac 3:1 One day Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time of prayer--at three in the afternoon.
44Ac 3:2 Now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called Beautiful, where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts.
44Ac 3:3 When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for money.
44Ac 3:4 Peter looked straight at him, as did John. Then Peter said, "Look at us!"
44Ac 3:5 So the man gave them his attention, expecting to get something from them.
44Ac 3:6 Then Peter said, "Silver or gold I do not have, but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk."
44Ac 3:7 Taking him by the right hand, he helped him up, and instantly the man's feet and ankles became strong.
44Ac 3:8 He jumped to his feet and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple courts, walking and jumping, and praising God.
44Ac 3:9 When all the people saw him walking and praising God,
44Ac 3:10 they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called Beautiful, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
44Ac 3:11 While the beggar held on to Peter and John, all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called Solomon's Colonnade.
44Ac 3:12 When Peter saw this, he said to them£º "Men of Israel, why does this surprise you? Why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?
44Ac 3:13 The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus. You handed him over to be killed, and you disowned him before Pilate, though he had decided to let him go.
44Ac 3:14 You disowned the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a murderer be released to you.
44Ac 3:15 You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses of this.
44Ac 3:16 By faith in the name of Jesus, this man whom you see and know was made strong. It is Jesus' name and the faith that comes through him that has given this complete healing to him, as you can all see.
44Ac 3:17 "Now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did your leaders.
44Ac 3:18 But this is how God fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets, saying that his Christ would suffer.
44Ac 3:19 Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,
44Ac 3:20 and that he may send the Christ, who has been appointed for you--even Jesus.
44Ac 3:21 He must remain in heaven until the time comes for God to restore everything, as he promised long ago through his holy prophets.
44Ac 3:22 For Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people; you must listen to everything he tells you.
44Ac 3:23 Anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from among his people.'
44Ac 3:24 "Indeed, all the prophets from Samuel on, as many as have spoken, have foretold these days.
44Ac 3:25 And you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant God made with your fathers. He said to Abraham, 'Through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed.'
44Ac 3:26 When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways."
44Ac 4:1 The priests and the captain of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to Peter and John while they were speaking to the people.
44Ac 4:2 They were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
44Ac 4:3 They seized Peter and John, and because it was evening, they put them in jail until the next day.
44Ac 4:4 But many who heard the message believed, and the number of men grew to about five thousand.
44Ac 4:5 The next day the rulers, elders and teachers of the law met in Jerusalem.
44Ac 4:6 Annas the high priest was there, and so were Caiaphas, John, Alexander and the other men of the high priest's family.
44Ac 4:7 They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them£º "By what power or what name did you do this?"
44Ac 4:8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them£º "Rulers and elders of the people!
44Ac 4:9 If we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed,
44Ac 4:10 then know this, you and all the people of Israel£º It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.
44Ac 4:11 He is "'the stone you builders rejected, which has become the capstone.'
44Ac 4:12 Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."
44Ac 4:13 When they saw the courage of Peter and John and realized that they were unschooled, ordinary men, they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with Jesus.
44Ac 4:14 But since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them, there was nothing they could say.
44Ac 4:15 So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin and then conferred together.
44Ac 4:16 "What are we going to do with these men?" they asked. "Everybody living in Jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle, and we cannot deny it.
44Ac 4:17 But to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people, we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name."
44Ac 4:18 Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 4:19 But Peter and John replied, "Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God's sight to obey you rather than God.
44Ac 4:20 For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."
44Ac 4:21 After further threats they let them go. They could not decide how to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
44Ac 4:22 For the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old.
44Ac 4:23 On their release, Peter and John went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.
44Ac 4:24 When they heard this, they raised their voices together in prayer to God. "Sovereign Lord," they said, "you made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them.
44Ac 4:25 You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David£º "'Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
44Ac 4:26 The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the Lord and against his Anointed One.'
44Ac 4:27 Indeed Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.
44Ac 4:28 They did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.
44Ac 4:29 Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness.
44Ac 4:30 Stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
44Ac 4:31 After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.
44Ac 4:32 All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but they shared everything they had.
44Ac 4:33 With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and much grace was upon them all.
44Ac 4:34 There were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales
44Ac 4:35 and put it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to anyone as he had need.
44Ac 4:36 Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement),
44Ac 4:37 sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles' feet.
44Ac 5:1 Now a man named Ananias, together with his wife Sapphira, also sold a piece of property.
44Ac 5:2 With his wife's full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself, but brought the rest and put it at the apostles' feet.
44Ac 5:3 Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the Holy Spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land?
44Ac 5:4 Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God."
44Ac 5:5 When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened.
44Ac 5:6 Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him.
44Ac 5:7 About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
44Ac 5:8 Peter asked her, "Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?" "Yes," she said, "that is the price."
44Ac 5:9 Peter said to her, "How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also."
44Ac 5:10 At that moment she fell down at his feet and died. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
44Ac 5:11 Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events.
44Ac 5:12 The apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers used to meet together in Solomon's Colonnade.
44Ac 5:13 No one else dared join them, even though they were highly regarded by the people.
44Ac 5:14 Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number.
44Ac 5:15 As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by.
44Ac 5:16 Crowds gathered also from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those tormented by evil spirits, and all of them were healed.
44Ac 5:17 Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
44Ac 5:18 They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
44Ac 5:19 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out.
44Ac 5:20 "Go, stand in the temple courts," he said, "and tell the people the full message of this new life."
44Ac 5:21 At daybreak they entered the temple courts, as they had been told, and began to teach the people. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin--the full assembly of the elders of Israel--and sent to the jail for the apostles.
44Ac 5:22 But on arriving at the jail, the officers did not find them there. So they went back and reported,
44Ac 5:23 "We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside."
44Ac 5:24 On hearing this report, the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were puzzled, wondering what would come of this.
44Ac 5:25 Then someone came and said, "Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people."
44Ac 5:26 At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles. They did not use force, because they feared that the people would stone them.
44Ac 5:27 Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.
44Ac 5:28 "We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name," he said. "Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood."
44Ac 5:29 Peter and the other apostles replied£º "We must obey God rather than men!
44Ac 5:30 The God of our fathers raised Jesus from the dead--whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree.
44Ac 5:31 God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.
44Ac 5:32 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
44Ac 5:33 When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to put them to death.
44Ac 5:34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, who was honored by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while.
44Ac 5:35 Then he addressed them£º "Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do to these men.
44Ac 5:36 Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.
44Ac 5:37 After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too was killed, and all his followers were scattered.
44Ac 5:38 Therefore, in the present case I advise you£º Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.
44Ac 5:39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God."
44Ac 5:40 His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
44Ac 5:41 The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.
44Ac 5:42 Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.
44Ac 6:1 In those days when the number of disciples was increasing, the Grecian Jews among them complained against the Hebraic Jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food.
44Ac 6:2 So the Twelve gathered all the disciples together and said, "It would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of God in order to wait on tables.
44Ac 6:3 Brothers, choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will turn this responsibility over to them
44Ac 6:4 and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word."
44Ac 6:5 This proposal pleased the whole group. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit; also Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas from Antioch, a convert to Judaism.
44Ac 6:6 They presented these men to the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
44Ac 6:7 So the word of God spread. The number of disciples in Jerusalem increased rapidly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.
44Ac 6:8 Now Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people.
44Ac 6:9 Opposition arose, however, from members of the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called)--Jews of Cyrene and Alexandria as well as the provinces of Cilicia and Asia. These men began to argue with Stephen,
44Ac 6:10 but they could not stand up against his wisdom or the Spirit by whom he spoke.
44Ac 6:11 Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, "We have heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God."
44Ac 6:12 So they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law. They seized Stephen and brought him before the Sanhedrin.
44Ac 6:13 They produced false witnesses, who testified, "This fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law.
44Ac 6:14 For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs Moses handed down to us."
44Ac 6:15 All who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at Stephen, and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
44Ac 7:1 Then the high priest asked him, "Are these charges true?"
44Ac 7:2 To this he replied£º "Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran.
44Ac 7:3 'Leave your country and your people,' God said, 'and go to the land I will show you.'
44Ac 7:4 "So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living.
44Ac 7:5 He gave him no inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child.
44Ac 7:6 God spoke to him in this way£º 'Your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
44Ac 7:7 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,' God said, 'and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.'
44Ac 7:8 Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. And Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth. Later Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs.
44Ac 7:9 "Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him
44Ac 7:10 and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt; so he made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace.
44Ac 7:11 "Then a famine struck all Egypt and Canaan, bringing great suffering, and our fathers could not find food.
44Ac 7:12 When Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers on their first visit.
44Ac 7:13 On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph's family.
44Ac 7:14 After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all.
44Ac 7:15 Then Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our fathers died.
44Ac 7:16 Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a certain sum of money.
44Ac 7:17 "As the time drew near for God to fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased.
44Ac 7:18 Then another king, who knew nothing about Joseph, became ruler of Egypt.
44Ac 7:19 He dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our forefathers by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die.
44Ac 7:20 "At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. For three months he was cared for in his father's house.
44Ac 7:21 When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son.
44Ac 7:22 Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action.
44Ac 7:23 "When Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his fellow Israelites.
44Ac 7:24 He saw one of them being mistreated by an Egyptian, so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the Egyptian.
44Ac 7:25 Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not.
44Ac 7:26 The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?'
44Ac 7:27 "But the man who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside and said, 'Who made you ruler and judge over us?
44Ac 7:28 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
44Ac 7:29 When Moses heard this, he fled to Midian, where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons.
44Ac 7:30 "After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.
44Ac 7:31 When he saw this, he was amazed at the sight. As he went over to look more closely, he heard the Lord's voice£º
44Ac 7:32 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.' Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.
44Ac 7:33 "Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off your sandals; the place where you are standing is holy ground.
44Ac 7:34 I have indeed seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.'
44Ac 7:35 "This is the same Moses whom they had rejected with the words, 'Who made you ruler and judge?' He was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by God himself, through the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
44Ac 7:36 He led them out of Egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea and for forty years in the desert.
44Ac 7:37 "This is that Moses who told the Israelites, 'God will send you a prophet like me from your own people.'
44Ac 7:38 He was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living words to pass on to us.
44Ac 7:39 "But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.
44Ac 7:40 They told Aaron, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who led us out of Egypt--we don't know what has happened to him!'
44Ac 7:41 That was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and held a celebration in honor of what their hands had made.
44Ac 7:42 But God turned away and gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies. This agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets£º "'Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the desert, O house of Israel?
44Ac 7:43 You have lifted up the shrine of Molech and the star of your god Rephan, the idols you made to worship. Therefore I will send you into exile' beyond Babylon.
44Ac 7:44 "Our forefathers had the tabernacle of the Testimony with them in the desert. It had been made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.
44Ac 7:45 Having received the tabernacle, our fathers under Joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David,
44Ac 7:46 who enjoyed God's favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
44Ac 7:47 But it was Solomon who built the house for him.
44Ac 7:48 "However, the Most High does not live in houses made by men. As the prophet says£º
44Ac 7:49 "'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord. Or where will my resting place be?
44Ac 7:50 Has not my hand made all these things?'
44Ac 7:51 "You stiff-necked people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are just like your fathers£º You always resist the Holy Spirit!
44Ac 7:52 Was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One. And now you have betrayed and murdered him--
44Ac 7:53 you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it."
44Ac 7:54 When they heard this, they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him.
44Ac 7:55 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
44Ac 7:56 "Look," he said, "I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."
44Ac 7:57 At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him,
44Ac 7:58 dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.
44Ac 7:59 While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44Ac 7:60 Then he fell on his knees and cried out, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." When he had said this, he fell asleep.
44Ac 8:1 And Saul was there, giving approval to his death. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
44Ac 8:2 Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
44Ac 8:3 But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.
44Ac 8:4 Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
44Ac 8:5 Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there.
44Ac 8:6 When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said.
44Ac 8:7 With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed.
44Ac 8:8 So there was great joy in that city.
44Ac 8:9 Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,
44Ac 8:10 and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, "This man is the divine power known as the Great Power."
44Ac 8:11 They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.
44Ac 8:12 But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
44Ac 8:13 Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.
44Ac 8:14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
44Ac 8:15 When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
44Ac 8:16 because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 8:17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 8:18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money
44Ac 8:19 and said, "Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 8:20 Peter answered£º "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!
44Ac 8:21 You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God.
44Ac 8:22 Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart.
44Ac 8:23 For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin."
44Ac 8:24 Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me."
44Ac 8:25 When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
44Ac 8:26 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Go south to the road--the desert road--that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza."
44Ac 8:27 So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, an important official in charge of all the treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. This man had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
44Ac 8:28 and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of Isaiah the prophet.
44Ac 8:29 The Spirit told Philip, "Go to that chariot and stay near it."
44Ac 8:30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. "Do you understand what you are reading?" Philip asked.
44Ac 8:31 "How can I," he said, "unless someone explains it to me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
44Ac 8:32 The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture£º "He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
44Ac 8:33 In his humiliation he was deprived of justice. Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth."
44Ac 8:34 The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, please, who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?"
44Ac 8:35 Then Philip began with that very passage of Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.
44Ac 8:36 As they traveled along the road, they came to some water and the eunuch said, "Look, here is water. Why shouldn't I be baptized?"
44Ac 8:37 Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may." The eunuch answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
44Ac 8:38 And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water and Philip baptized him.
44Ac 8:39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.
44Ac 8:40 Philip, however, appeared at Azotus and traveled about, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
44Ac 9:1 Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest
44Ac 9:2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.
44Ac 9:3 As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
44Ac 9:4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
44Ac 9:5 "Who are you, Lord?" Saul asked. "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting," he replied.
44Ac 9:6 "Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."
44Ac 9:7 The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone.
44Ac 9:8 Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.
44Ac 9:9 For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.
44Ac 9:10 In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, "Ananias!" "Yes, Lord," he answered.
44Ac 9:11 The Lord told him, "Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.
44Ac 9:12 In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight."
44Ac 9:13 "Lord," Ananias answered, "I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.
44Ac 9:14 And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name."
44Ac 9:15 But the Lord said to Ananias, "Go! This man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the Gentiles and their kings and before the people of Israel.
44Ac 9:16 I will show him how much he must suffer for my name."
44Ac 9:17 Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord--Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here--has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 9:18 Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,
44Ac 9:19 and after taking some food, he regained his strength. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.
44Ac 9:20 At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.
44Ac 9:21 All those who heard him were astonished and asked, "Isn't he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn't he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?"
44Ac 9:22 Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.
44Ac 9:23 After many days had gone by, the Jews conspired to kill him,
44Ac 9:24 but Saul learned of their plan. Day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him.
44Ac 9:25 But his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall.
44Ac 9:26 When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple.
44Ac 9:27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how Saul on his journey had seen the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 9:28 So Saul stayed with them and moved about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.
44Ac 9:29 He talked and debated with the Grecian Jews, but they tried to kill him.
44Ac 9:30 When the brothers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
44Ac 9:31 Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord.
44Ac 9:32 As Peter traveled about the country, he went to visit the saints in Lydda.
44Ac 9:33 There he found a man named Aeneas, a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years.
44Ac 9:34 "Aeneas," Peter said to him, "Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and take care of your mat." Immediately Aeneas got up.
44Ac 9:35 All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
44Ac 9:36 In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is Dorcas), who was always doing good and helping the poor.
44Ac 9:37 About that time she became sick and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.
44Ac 9:38 Lydda was near Joppa; so when the disciples heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two men to him and urged him, "Please come at once!"
44Ac 9:39 Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.
44Ac 9:40 Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, "Tabitha, get up." She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.
44Ac 9:41 He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive.
44Ac 9:42 This became known all over Joppa, and many people believed in the Lord.
44Ac 9:43 Peter stayed in Joppa for some time with a tanner named Simon.
44Ac 10:1 At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.
44Ac 10:2 He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly.
44Ac 10:3 One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, "Cornelius!"
44Ac 10:4 Cornelius stared at him in fear. "What is it, Lord?" he asked. The angel answered, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God.
44Ac 10:5 Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter.
44Ac 10:6 He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea."
44Ac 10:7 When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants.
44Ac 10:8 He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa.
44Ac 10:9 About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray.
44Ac 10:10 He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
44Ac 10:11 He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners.
44Ac 10:12 It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air.
44Ac 10:13 Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter. Kill and eat."
44Ac 10:14 "Surely not, Lord!" Peter replied. "I have never eaten anything impure or unclean."
44Ac 10:15 The voice spoke to him a second time, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean."
44Ac 10:16 This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.
44Ac 10:17 While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon's house was and stopped at the gate.
44Ac 10:18 They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.
44Ac 10:19 While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Simon, three men are looking for you.
44Ac 10:20 So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them."
44Ac 10:21 Peter went down and said to the men, "I'm the one you're looking for. Why have you come?"
44Ac 10:22 The men replied, "We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say."
44Ac 10:23 Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along.
44Ac 10:24 The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
44Ac 10:25 As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.
44Ac 10:26 But Peter made him get up. "Stand up," he said, "I am only a man myself."
44Ac 10:27 Talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.
44Ac 10:28 He said to them£º "You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with a Gentile or visit him. But God has shown me that I should not call any man impure or unclean.
44Ac 10:29 So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?"
44Ac 10:30 Cornelius answered£º "Four days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me
44Ac 10:31 and said, 'Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor.
44Ac 10:32 Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.'
44Ac 10:33 So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us."
44Ac 10:34 Then Peter began to speak£º "I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism
44Ac 10:35 but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right.
44Ac 10:36 You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, telling the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
44Ac 10:37 You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached--
44Ac 10:38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him.
44Ac 10:39 "We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree,
44Ac 10:40 but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen.
44Ac 10:41 He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen--by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
44Ac 10:42 He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.
44Ac 10:43 All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."
44Ac 10:44 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message.
44Ac 10:45 The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.
44Ac 10:46 For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,
44Ac 10:47 "Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have."
44Ac 10:48 So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
44Ac 11:1 The apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
44Ac 11:2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him
44Ac 11:3 and said, "You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them."
44Ac 11:4 Peter began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened£º
44Ac 11:5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.
44Ac 11:6 I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.
44Ac 11:7 Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.'
44Ac 11:8 "I replied, 'Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
44Ac 11:9 "The voice spoke from heaven a second time, 'Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.'
44Ac 11:10 This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.
44Ac 11:11 "Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.
44Ac 11:12 The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house.
44Ac 11:13 He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.
44Ac 11:14 He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.'
44Ac 11:15 "As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.
44Ac 11:16 Then I remembered what the Lord had said£º 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
44Ac 11:17 So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?"
44Ac 11:18 When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life."
44Ac 11:19 Now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, telling the message only to Jews.
44Ac 11:20 Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 11:21 The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.
44Ac 11:22 News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
44Ac 11:23 When he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.
44Ac 11:24 He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.
44Ac 11:25 Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
44Ac 11:26 and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.
44Ac 11:27 During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
44Ac 11:28 One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.)
44Ac 11:29 The disciples, each according to his ability, decided to provide help for the brothers living in Judea.
44Ac 11:30 This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
44Ac 12:1 It was about this time that King Herod arrested some who belonged to the church, intending to persecute them.
44Ac 12:2 He had James, the brother of John, put to death with the sword.
44Ac 12:3 When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also. This happened during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
44Ac 12:4 After arresting him, he put him in prison, handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.
44Ac 12:5 So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him.
44Ac 12:6 The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries stood guard at the entrance.
44Ac 12:7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up. "Quick, get up!" he said, and the chains fell off Peter's wrists.
44Ac 12:8 Then the angel said to him, "Put on your clothes and sandals." And Peter did so. "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me," the angel told him.
44Ac 12:9 Peter followed him out of the prison, but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening; he thought he was seeing a vision.
44Ac 12:10 They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went through it. When they had walked the length of one street, suddenly the angel left him.
44Ac 12:11 Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I know without a doubt that the Lord sent his angel and rescued me from Herod's clutches and from everything the Jewish people were anticipating."
44Ac 12:12 When this had dawned on him, he went to the house of Mary the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying.
44Ac 12:13 Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer the door.
44Ac 12:14 When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, "Peter is at the door!"
44Ac 12:15 "You're out of your mind," they told her. When she kept insisting that it was so, they said, "It must be his angel."
44Ac 12:16 But Peter kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.
44Ac 12:17 Peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the Lord had brought him out of prison. "Tell James and the brothers about this," he said, and then he left for another place.
44Ac 12:18 In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.
44Ac 12:19 After Herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him, he cross-examined the guards and ordered that they be executed. Then Herod went from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there a while.
44Ac 12:20 He had been quarreling with the people of Tyre and Sidon; they now joined together and sought an audience with him. Having secured the support of Blastus, a trusted personal servant of the king, they asked for peace, because they depended on the king's country for their food supply.
44Ac 12:21 On the appointed day Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people.
44Ac 12:22 They shouted, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man."
44Ac 12:23 Immediately, because Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.
44Ac 12:24 But the word of God continued to increase and spread.
44Ac 12:25 When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission, they returned from Jerusalem, taking with them John, also called Mark.
44Ac 13:1 In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers£º Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch) and Saul.
44Ac 13:2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
44Ac 13:3 So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.
44Ac 13:4 The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.
44Ac 13:5 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their helper.
44Ac 13:6 They traveled through the whole island until they came to Paphos. There they met a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,
44Ac 13:7 who was an attendant of the proconsul, Sergius Paulus. The proconsul, an intelligent man, sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
44Ac 13:8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is what his name means) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith.
44Ac 13:9 Then Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight at Elymas and said,
44Ac 13:10 "You are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord?
44Ac 13:11 Now the hand of the Lord is against you. You are going to be blind, and for a time you will be unable to see the light of the sun." Immediately mist and darkness came over him, and he groped about, seeking someone to lead him by the hand.
44Ac 13:12 When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.
44Ac 13:13 From Paphos, Paul and his companions sailed to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.
44Ac 13:14 From Perga they went on to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down.
44Ac 13:15 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue rulers sent word to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have a message of encouragement for the people, please speak."
44Ac 13:16 Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said£º "Men of Israel and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me!
44Ac 13:17 The God of the people of Israel chose our fathers; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt, with mighty power he led them out of that country,
44Ac 13:18 he endured their conduct for about forty years in the desert,
44Ac 13:19 he overthrew seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to his people as their inheritance.
44Ac 13:20 All this took about 450 years. "After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.
44Ac 13:21 Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years.
44Ac 13:22 After removing Saul, he made David their king. He testified concerning him£º 'I have found David son of Jesse a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.'
44Ac 13:23 "From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised.
44Ac 13:24 Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel.
44Ac 13:25 As John was completing his work, he said£º 'Who do you think I am? I am not that one. No, but he is coming after me, whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.'
44Ac 13:26 "Brothers, children of Abraham, and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.
44Ac 13:27 The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
44Ac 13:28 Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed.
44Ac 13:29 When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.
44Ac 13:30 But God raised him from the dead,
44Ac 13:31 and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people.
44Ac 13:32 "We tell you the good news£º What God promised our fathers
44Ac 13:33 he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm£º "'You are my Son; today I have become your Father.'
44Ac 13:34 The fact that God raised him from the dead, never to decay, is stated in these words£º "'I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.'
44Ac 13:35 So it is stated elsewhere£º "'You will not let your Holy One see decay.'
44Ac 13:36 "For when David had served God's purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his fathers and his body decayed.
44Ac 13:37 But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.
44Ac 13:38 "Therefore, my brothers, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.
44Ac 13:39 Through him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of Moses.
44Ac 13:40 Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you£º
44Ac 13:41 "'Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.'"
44Ac 13:42 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.
44Ac 13:43 When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.
44Ac 13:44 On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
44Ac 13:45 When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and talked abusively against what Paul was saying.
44Ac 13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas answered them boldly£º "We had to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.
44Ac 13:47 For this is what the Lord has commanded us£º "'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
44Ac 13:48 When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
44Ac 13:49 The word of the Lord spread through the whole region.
44Ac 13:50 But the Jews incited the God-fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.
44Ac 13:51 So they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.
44Ac 13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 14:1 At Iconium Paul and Barnabas went as usual into the Jewish synagogue. There they spoke so effectively that a great number of Jews and Gentiles believed.
44Ac 14:2 But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
44Ac 14:3 So Paul and Barnabas spent considerable time there, speaking boldly for the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders.
44Ac 14:4 The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, others with the apostles.
44Ac 14:5 There was a plot afoot among the Gentiles and Jews, together with their leaders, to mistreat them and stone them.
44Ac 14:6 But they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding country,
44Ac 14:7 where they continued to preach the good news.
44Ac 14:8 In Lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet, who was lame from birth and had never walked.
44Ac 14:9 He listened to Paul as he was speaking. Paul looked directly at him, saw that he had faith to be healed
44Ac 14:10 and called out, "Stand up on your feet!" At that, the man jumped up and began to walk.
44Ac 14:11 When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have come down to us in human form!"
44Ac 14:12 Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul they called Hermes because he was the chief speaker.
44Ac 14:13 The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them.
44Ac 14:14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of this, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting£º
44Ac 14:15 "Men, why are you doing this? We too are only men, human like you. We are bringing you good news, telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them.
44Ac 14:16 In the past, he let all nations go their own way.
44Ac 14:17 Yet he has not left himself without testimony£º He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy."
44Ac 14:18 Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them.
44Ac 14:19 Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowd over. They stoned Paul and dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.
44Ac 14:20 But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe.
44Ac 14:21 They preached the good news in that city and won a large number of disciples. Then they returned to Lystra, Iconium and Antioch,
44Ac 14:22 strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith. "We must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God," they said.
44Ac 14:23 Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and, with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.
44Ac 14:24 After going through Pisidia, they came into Pamphylia,
44Ac 14:25 and when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.
44Ac 14:26 From Attalia they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.
44Ac 14:27 On arriving there, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.
44Ac 14:28 And they stayed there a long time with the disciples.
44Ac 15:1 Some men came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the brothers£º "Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved."
44Ac 15:2 This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question.
44Ac 15:3 The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the brothers very glad.
44Ac 15:4 When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them.
44Ac 15:5 Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of Moses."
44Ac 15:6 The apostles and elders met to consider this question.
44Ac 15:7 After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them£º "Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe.
44Ac 15:8 God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us.
44Ac 15:9 He made no distinction between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith.
44Ac 15:10 Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear?
44Ac 15:11 No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are."
44Ac 15:12 The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.
44Ac 15:13 When they finished, James spoke up£º "Brothers, listen to me.
44Ac 15:14 Simon has described to us how God at first showed his concern by taking from the Gentiles a people for himself.
44Ac 15:15 The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written£º
44Ac 15:16 "'After this I will return and rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,
44Ac 15:17 that the remnant of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who bear my name, says the Lord, who does these things'
44Ac 15:18 that have been known for ages.
44Ac 15:19 "It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
44Ac 15:20 Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.
44Ac 15:21 For Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath."
44Ac 15:22 Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, two men who were leaders among the brothers.
44Ac 15:23 With them they sent the following letter£º The apostles and elders, your brothers, To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia£º Greetings.
44Ac 15:24 We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said.
44Ac 15:25 So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul--
44Ac 15:26 men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44Ac 15:27 Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.
44Ac 15:28 It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements£º
44Ac 15:29 You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. Farewell.
44Ac 15:30 The men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.
44Ac 15:31 The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message.
44Ac 15:32 Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.
44Ac 15:33 After spending some time there, they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.
44Ac 15:34 But Silas decided to remain there.
44Ac 15:35 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord.
44Ac 15:36 Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing."
44Ac 15:37 Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them,
44Ac 15:38 but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.
44Ac 15:39 They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,
44Ac 15:40 but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.
44Ac 15:41 He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
44Ac 16:1 He came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was a Jewess and a believer, but whose father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:2 The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.
44Ac 16:3 Paul wanted to take him along on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews who lived in that area, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:4 As they traveled from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey.
44Ac 16:5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.
44Ac 16:6 Paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word in the province of Asia.
44Ac 16:7 When they came to the border of Mysia, they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.
44Ac 16:8 So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.
44Ac 16:9 During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing and begging him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
44Ac 16:10 After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
44Ac 16:11 From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, and the next day on to Neapolis.
44Ac 16:12 From there we traveled to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city of that district of Macedonia. And we stayed there several days.
44Ac 16:13 On the Sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.
44Ac 16:14 One of those listening was a woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.
44Ac 16:15 When she and the members of her household were baptized, she invited us to her home. "If you consider me a believer in the Lord," she said, "come and stay at my house." And she persuaded us.
44Ac 16:16 Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.
44Ac 16:17 This girl followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved."
44Ac 16:18 She kept this up for many days. Finally Paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit, "In the name of Jesus Christ I command you to come out of her!" At that moment the spirit left her.
44Ac 16:19 When the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities.
44Ac 16:20 They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar
44Ac 16:21 by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice."
44Ac 16:22 The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten.
44Ac 16:23 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully.
44Ac 16:24 Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
44Ac 16:25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
44Ac 16:26 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everybody's chains came loose.
44Ac 16:27 The jailer woke up, and when he saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped.
44Ac 16:28 But Paul shouted, "Don't harm yourself! We are all here!"
44Ac 16:29 The jailer called for lights, rushed in and fell trembling before Paul and Silas.
44Ac 16:30 He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44Ac 16:31 They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved--you and your household."
44Ac 16:32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house.
44Ac 16:33 At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized.
44Ac 16:34 The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God--he and his whole family.
44Ac 16:35 When it was daylight, the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order£º "Release those men."
44Ac 16:36 The jailer told Paul, "The magistrates have ordered that you and Silas be released. Now you can leave. Go in peace."
44Ac 16:37 But Paul said to the officers£º "They beat us publicly without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens, and threw us into prison. And now do they want to get rid of us quietly? No! Let them come themselves and escort us out."
44Ac 16:38 The officers reported this to the magistrates, and when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were alarmed.
44Ac 16:39 They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.
44Ac 16:40 After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia's house, where they met with the brothers and encouraged them. Then they left.
44Ac 17:1 When they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
44Ac 17:2 As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
44Ac 17:3 explaining and proving that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. "This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Christ," he said.
44Ac 17:4 Some of the Jews were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks and not a few prominent women.
44Ac 17:5 But the Jews were jealous; so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace, formed a mob and started a riot in the city. They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the crowd.
44Ac 17:6 But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials, shouting£º "These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,
44Ac 17:7 and Jason has welcomed them into his house. They are all defying Caesar's decrees, saying that there is another king, one called Jesus."
44Ac 17:8 When they heard this, the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil.
44Ac 17:9 Then they made Jason and the others post bond and let them go.
44Ac 17:10 As soon as it was night, the brothers sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
44Ac 17:11 Now the Bereans were of more noble character than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true.
44Ac 17:12 Many of the Jews believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.
44Ac 17:13 When the Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God at Berea, they went there too, agitating the crowds and stirring them up.
44Ac 17:14 The brothers immediately sent Paul to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed at Berea.
44Ac 17:15 The men who escorted Paul brought him to Athens and then left with instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible.
44Ac 17:16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols.
44Ac 17:17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Greeks, as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.
44Ac 17:18 A group of Epicurean and Stoic philosophers began to dispute with him. Some of them asked, "What is this babbler trying to say?" Others remarked, "He seems to be advocating foreign gods." They said this because Paul was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
44Ac 17:19 Then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said to him, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
44Ac 17:20 You are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean."
44Ac 17:21 (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)
44Ac 17:22 Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said£º "Men of Athens! I see that in every way you are very religious.
44Ac 17:23 For as I walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription£º TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Now what you worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you.
44Ac 17:24 "The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands.
44Ac 17:25 And he is not served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else.
44Ac 17:26 From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.
44Ac 17:27 God did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.
44Ac 17:28 'For in him we live and move and have our being.' As some of your own poets have said, 'We are his offspring.'
44Ac 17:29 "Therefore since we are God's offspring, we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone--an image made by man's design and skill.
44Ac 17:30 In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.
44Ac 17:31 For he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead."
44Ac 17:32 When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, "We want to hear you again on this subject."
44Ac 17:33 At that, Paul left the Council.
44Ac 17:34 A few men became followers of Paul and believed. Among them was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a number of others.
44Ac 18:1 After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
44Ac 18:2 There he met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them,
44Ac 18:3 and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.
44Ac 18:4 Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
44Ac 18:5 When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
44Ac 18:6 But when the Jews opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am clear of my responsibility. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
44Ac 18:7 Then Paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of Titius Justus, a worshiper of God.
44Ac 18:8 Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and his entire household believed in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized.
44Ac 18:9 One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision£º "Do not be afraid; keep on speaking, do not be silent.
44Ac 18:10 For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city."
44Ac 18:11 So Paul stayed for a year and a half, teaching them the word of God.
44Ac 18:12 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him into court.
44Ac 18:13 "This man," they charged, "is persuading the people to worship God in ways contrary to the law."
44Ac 18:14 Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, "If you Jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you.
44Ac 18:15 But since it involves questions about words and names and your own law--settle the matter yourselves. I will not be a judge of such things."
44Ac 18:16 So he had them ejected from the court.
44Ac 18:17 Then they all turned on Sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him in front of the court. But Gallio showed no concern whatever.
44Ac 18:18 Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before he sailed, he had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because of a vow he had taken.
44Ac 18:19 They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
44Ac 18:20 When they asked him to spend more time with them, he declined.
44Ac 18:21 But as he left, he promised, "I will come back if it is God's will." Then he set sail from Ephesus.
44Ac 18:22 When he landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church and then went down to Antioch.
44Ac 18:23 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
44Ac 18:24 Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was a learned man, with a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures.
44Ac 18:25 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and he spoke with great fervor and taught about Jesus accurately, though he knew only the baptism of John.
44Ac 18:26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of God more adequately.
44Ac 18:27 When Apollos wanted to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him. On arriving, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.
44Ac 18:28 For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public debate, proving from the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
44Ac 19:1 While Apollos was at Corinth, Paul took the road through the interior and arrived at Ephesus. There he found some disciples
44Ac 19:2 and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They answered, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
44Ac 19:3 So Paul asked, "Then what baptism did you receive?" "John's baptism," they replied.
44Ac 19:4 Paul said, "John's baptism was a baptism of repentance. He told the people to believe in the one coming after him, that is, in Jesus."
44Ac 19:5 On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 19:6 When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
44Ac 19:7 There were about twelve men in all.
44Ac 19:8 Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months, arguing persuasively about the kingdom of God.
44Ac 19:9 But some of them became obstinate; they refused to believe and publicly maligned the Way. So Paul left them. He took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
44Ac 19:10 This went on for two years, so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord.
44Ac 19:11 God did extraordinary miracles through Paul,
44Ac 19:12 so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.
44Ac 19:13 Some Jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were demon-possessed. They would say, "In the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, I command you to come out."
44Ac 19:14 Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.
44Ac 19:15 One day the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?"
44Ac 19:16 Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all. He gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding.
44Ac 19:17 When this became known to the Jews and Greeks living in Ephesus, they were all seized with fear, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high honor.
44Ac 19:18 Many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds.
44Ac 19:19 A number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly. When they calculated the value of the scrolls, the total came to fifty thousand drachmas.
44Ac 19:20 In this way the word of the Lord spread widely and grew in power.
44Ac 19:21 After all this had happened, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. "After I have been there," he said, "I must visit Rome also."
44Ac 19:22 He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed in the province of Asia a little longer.
44Ac 19:23 About that time there arose a great disturbance about the Way.
44Ac 19:24 A silversmith named Demetrius, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought in no little business for the craftsmen.
44Ac 19:25 He called them together, along with the workmen in related trades, and said£º "Men, you know we receive a good income from this business.
44Ac 19:26 And you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that man-made gods are no gods at all.
44Ac 19:27 There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and the goddess herself, who is worshiped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty."
44Ac 19:28 When they heard this, they were furious and began shouting£º "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:29 Soon the whole city was in an uproar. The people seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia, and rushed as one man into the theater.
44Ac 19:30 Paul wanted to appear before the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.
44Ac 19:31 Even some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater.
44Ac 19:32 The assembly was in confusion£º Some were shouting one thing, some another. Most of the people did not even know why they were there.
44Ac 19:33 The Jews pushed Alexander to the front, and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him. He motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people.
44Ac 19:34 But when they realized he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours£º "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:35 The city clerk quieted the crowd and said£º "Men of Ephesus, doesn't all the world know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image, which fell from heaven?
44Ac 19:36 Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash.
44Ac 19:37 You have brought these men here, though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess.
44Ac 19:38 If, then, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They can press charges.
44Ac 19:39 If there is anything further you want to bring up, it must be settled in a legal assembly.
44Ac 19:40 As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it."
44Ac 19:41 After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.
44Ac 20:1 When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after encouraging them, said good-by and set out for Macedonia.
44Ac 20:2 He traveled through that area, speaking many words of encouragement to the people, and finally arrived in Greece,
44Ac 20:3 where he stayed three months. Because the Jews made a plot against him just as he was about to sail for Syria, he decided to go back through Macedonia.
44Ac 20:4 He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy also, and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.
44Ac 20:5 These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
44Ac 20:6 But we sailed from Philippi after the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days.
44Ac 20:7 On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight.
44Ac 20:8 There were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.
44Ac 20:9 Seated in a window was a young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep as Paul talked on and on. When he was sound asleep, he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead.
44Ac 20:10 Paul went down, threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him. "Don't be alarmed," he said. "He's alive!"
44Ac 20:11 Then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate. After talking until daylight, he left.
44Ac 20:12 The people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.
44Ac 20:13 We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul aboard. He had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot.
44Ac 20:14 When he met us at Assos, we took him aboard and went on to Mitylene.
44Ac 20:15 The next day we set sail from there and arrived off Kios. The day after that we crossed over to Samos, and on the following day arrived at Miletus.
44Ac 20:16 Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, for he was in a hurry to reach Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost.
44Ac 20:17 From Miletus, Paul sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church.
44Ac 20:18 When they arrived, he said to them£º "You know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I came into the province of Asia.
44Ac 20:19 I served the Lord with great humility and with tears, although I was severely tested by the plots of the Jews.
44Ac 20:20 You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.
44Ac 20:21 I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.
44Ac 20:22 "And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there.
44Ac 20:23 I only know that in every city the Holy Spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me.
44Ac 20:24 However, I consider my life worth nothing to me, if only I may finish the race and complete the task the Lord Jesus has given me--the task of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.
44Ac 20:25 "Now I know that none of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again.
44Ac 20:26 Therefore, I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of all men.
44Ac 20:27 For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God.
44Ac 20:28 Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood.
44Ac 20:29 I know that after I leave, savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock.
44Ac 20:30 Even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them.
44Ac 20:31 So be on your guard! Remember that for three years I never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears.
44Ac 20:32 "Now I commit you to God and to the word of his grace, which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
44Ac 20:33 I have not coveted anyone's silver or gold or clothing.
44Ac 20:34 You yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.
44Ac 20:35 In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said£º 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44Ac 20:36 When he had said this, he knelt down with all of them and prayed.
44Ac 20:37 They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him.
44Ac 20:38 What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
44Ac 21:1 After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Cos. The next day we went to Rhodes and from there to Patara.
44Ac 21:2 We found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, went on board and set sail.
44Ac 21:3 After sighting Cyprus and passing to the south of it, we sailed on to Syria. We landed at Tyre, where our ship was to unload its cargo.
44Ac 21:4 Finding the disciples there, we stayed with them seven days. Through the Spirit they urged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:5 But when our time was up, we left and continued on our way. All the disciples and their wives and children accompanied us out of the city, and there on the beach we knelt to pray.
44Ac 21:6 After saying good-by to each other, we went aboard the ship, and they returned home.
44Ac 21:7 We continued our voyage from Tyre and landed at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day.
44Ac 21:8 Leaving the next day, we reached Caesarea and stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven.
44Ac 21:9 He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.
44Ac 21:10 After we had been there a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
44Ac 21:11 Coming over to us, he took Paul's belt, tied his own hands and feet with it and said, "The Holy Spirit says, 'In this way the Jews of Jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'"
44Ac 21:12 When we heard this, we and the people there pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:13 Then Paul answered, "Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44Ac 21:14 When he would not be dissuaded, we gave up and said, "The Lord's will be done."
44Ac 21:15 After this, we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of Mnason, where we were to stay. He was a man from Cyprus and one of the early disciples.
44Ac 21:17 When we arrived at Jerusalem, the brothers received us warmly.
44Ac 21:18 The next day Paul and the rest of us went to see James, and all the elders were present.
44Ac 21:19 Paul greeted them and reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
44Ac 21:20 When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul£º "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and all of them are zealous for the law.
44Ac 21:21 They have been informed that you teach all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn away from Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs.
44Ac 21:22 What shall we do? They will certainly hear that you have come,
44Ac 21:23 so do what we tell you. There are four men with us who have made a vow.
44Ac 21:24 Take these men, join in their purification rites and pay their expenses, so that they can have their heads shaved. Then everybody will know there is no truth in these reports about you, but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law.
44Ac 21:25 As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality."
44Ac 21:26 The next day Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. Then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them.
44Ac 21:27 When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul at the temple. They stirred up the whole crowd and seized him,
44Ac 21:28 shouting, "Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place. And besides, he has brought Greeks into the temple area and defiled this holy place."
44Ac 21:29 (They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with Paul and assumed that Paul had brought him into the temple area.)
44Ac 21:30 The whole city was aroused, and the people came running from all directions. Seizing Paul, they dragged him from the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.
44Ac 21:31 While they were trying to kill him, news reached the commander of the Roman troops that the whole city of Jerusalem was in an uproar.
44Ac 21:32 He at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd. When the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
44Ac 21:33 The commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done.
44Ac 21:34 Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another, and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar, he ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks.
44Ac 21:35 When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers.
44Ac 21:36 The crowd that followed kept shouting, "Away with him!"
44Ac 21:37 As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the barracks, he asked the commander, "May I say something to you?" "Do you speak Greek?" he replied.
44Ac 21:38 "Aren't you the Egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the desert some time ago?"
44Ac 21:39 Paul answered, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no ordinary city. Please let me speak to the people."
44Ac 21:40 Having received the commander's permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd. When they were all silent, he said to them in Aramaic£º
44Ac 22:1 "Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense."
44Ac 22:2 When they heard him speak to them in Aramaic, they became very quiet. Then Paul said£º
44Ac 22:3 "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. Under Gamaliel I was thoroughly trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.
44Ac 22:4 I persecuted the followers of this Way to their death, arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison,
44Ac 22:5 as also the high priest and all the Council can testify. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.
44Ac 22:6 "About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.
44Ac 22:7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, 'Saul! Saul! Why do you persecute me?'
44Ac 22:8 "'Who are you, Lord?' I asked. "'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,' he replied.
44Ac 22:9 My companions saw the light, but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me.
44Ac 22:10 "'What shall I do, Lord?' I asked. "'Get up,' the Lord said, 'and go into Damascus. There you will be told all that you have been assigned to do.'
44Ac 22:11 My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.
44Ac 22:12 "A man named Ananias came to see me. He was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the Jews living there.
44Ac 22:13 He stood beside me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' And at that very moment I was able to see him.
44Ac 22:14 "Then he said£º 'The God of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear words from his mouth.
44Ac 22:15 You will be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.
44Ac 22:16 And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized and wash your sins away, calling on his name.'
44Ac 22:17 "When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance
44Ac 22:18 and saw the Lord speaking. 'Quick!' he said to me. 'Leave Jerusalem immediately, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'
44Ac 22:19 "'Lord,' I replied, 'these men know that I went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you.
44Ac 22:20 And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.'
44Ac 22:21 "Then the Lord said to me, 'Go; I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"
44Ac 22:22 The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, "Rid the earth of him! He's not fit to live!"
44Ac 22:23 As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,
44Ac 22:24 the commander ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks. He directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this.
44Ac 22:25 As they stretched him out to flog him, Paul said to the centurion standing there, "Is it legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been found guilty?"
44Ac 22:26 When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. "What are you going to do?" he asked. "This man is a Roman citizen."
44Ac 22:27 The commander went to Paul and asked, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes, I am," he answered.
44Ac 22:28 Then the commander said, "I had to pay a big price for my citizenship." "But I was born a citizen," Paul replied.
44Ac 22:29 Those who were about to question him withdrew immediately. The commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put Paul, a Roman citizen, in chains.
44Ac 22:30 The next day, since the commander wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul and had him stand before them.
44Ac 23:1 Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, "My brothers, I have fulfilled my duty to God in all good conscience to this day."
44Ac 23:2 At this the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.
44Ac 23:3 Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that I be struck!"
44Ac 23:4 Those who were standing near Paul said, "You dare to insult God's high priest?"
44Ac 23:5 Paul replied, "Brothers, I did not realize that he was the high priest; for it is written£º 'Do not speak evil about the ruler of your people.'"
44Ac 23:6 Then Paul, knowing that some of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, called out in the Sanhedrin, "My brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. I stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead."
44Ac 23:7 When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
44Ac 23:8 (The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, and that there are neither angels nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)
44Ac 23:9 There was a great uproar, and some of the teachers of the law who were Pharisees stood up and argued vigorously. "We find nothing wrong with this man," they said. "What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?"
44Ac 23:10 The dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them. He ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks.
44Ac 23:11 The following night the Lord stood near Paul and said, "Take courage! As you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."
44Ac 23:12 The next morning the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
44Ac 23:13 More than forty men were involved in this plot.
44Ac 23:14 They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.
44Ac 23:15 Now then, you and the Sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case. We are ready to kill him before he gets here."
44Ac 23:16 But when the son of Paul's sister heard of this plot, he went into the barracks and told Paul.
44Ac 23:17 Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the commander; he has something to tell him."
44Ac 23:18 So he took him to the commander. The centurion said, "Paul, the prisoner, sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you."
44Ac 23:19 The commander took the young man by the hand, drew him aside and asked, "What is it you want to tell me?"
44Ac 23:20 He said£º "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul before the Sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him.
44Ac 23:21 Don't give in to them, because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, waiting for your consent to their request."
44Ac 23:22 The commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him, "Don't tell anyone that you have reported this to me."
44Ac 23:23 Then he called two of his centurions and ordered them, "Get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.
44Ac 23:24 Provide mounts for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix."
44Ac 23:25 He wrote a letter as follows£º
44Ac 23:26 Claudius Lysias, To His Excellency, Governor Felix£º Greetings.
44Ac 23:27 This man was seized by the Jews and they were about to kill him, but I came with my troops and rescued him, for I had learned that he is a Roman citizen.
44Ac 23:28 I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him to their Sanhedrin.
44Ac 23:29 I found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law, but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment.
44Ac 23:30 When I was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man, I sent him to you at once. I also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him.
44Ac 23:31 So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul with them during the night and brought him as far as Antipatris.
44Ac 23:32 The next day they let the cavalry go on with him, while they returned to the barracks.
44Ac 23:33 When the cavalry arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.
44Ac 23:34 The governor read the letter and asked what province he was from. Learning that he was from Cilicia,
44Ac 23:35 he said, "I will hear your case when your accusers get here." Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod's palace.
44Ac 24:1 Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor.
44Ac 24:2 When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix£º "We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation.
44Ac 24:3 Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude.
44Ac 24:4 But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly.
44Ac 24:5 "We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect
44Ac 24:6 and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him.
44Ac 24:7 But the commander, Lysias, came and with the use of much force snatched him from our hands and ordered his accusers to come before you.
44Ac 24:8 By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him."
44Ac 24:9 The Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true.
44Ac 24:10 When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied£º "I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense.
44Ac 24:11 You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
44Ac 24:12 My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.
44Ac 24:13 And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me.
44Ac 24:14 However, I admit that I worship the God of our fathers as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that agrees with the Law and that is written in the Prophets,
44Ac 24:15 and I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.
44Ac 24:16 So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man.
44Ac 24:17 "After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings.
44Ac 24:18 I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance.
44Ac 24:19 But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.
44Ac 24:20 Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin--
44Ac 24:21 unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence£º 'It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'"
44Ac 24:22 Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. "When Lysias the commander comes," he said, "I will decide your case."
44Ac 24:23 He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs.
44Ac 24:24 Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.
44Ac 24:25 As Paul discoursed on righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, "That's enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you."
44Ac 24:26 At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.
44Ac 24:27 When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison.
44Ac 25:1 Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem,
44Ac 25:2 where the chief priests and Jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against Paul.
44Ac 25:3 They urgently requested Festus, as a favor to them, to have Paul transferred to Jerusalem, for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way.
44Ac 25:4 Festus answered, "Paul is being held at Caesarea, and I myself am going there soon.
44Ac 25:5 Let some of your leaders come with me and press charges against the man there, if he has done anything wrong."
44Ac 25:6 After spending eight or ten days with them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he convened the court and ordered that Paul be brought before him.
44Ac 25:7 When Paul appeared, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges against him, which they could not prove.
44Ac 25:8 Then Paul made his defense£º "I have done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews or against the temple or against Caesar."
44Ac 25:9 Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges?"
44Ac 25:10 Paul answered£º "I am now standing before Caesar's court, where I ought to be tried. I have not done any wrong to the Jews, as you yourself know very well.
44Ac 25:11 If, however, I am guilty of doing anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die. But if the charges brought against me by these Jews are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!"
44Ac 25:12 After Festus had conferred with his council, he declared£º "You have appealed to Caesar. To Caesar you will go!"
44Ac 25:13 A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.
44Ac 25:14 Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul's case with the king. He said£º "There is a man here whom Felix left as a prisoner.
44Ac 25:15 When I went to Jerusalem, the chief priests and elders of the Jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned.
44Ac 25:16 "I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over any man before he has faced his accusers and has had an opportunity to defend himself against their charges.
44Ac 25:17 When they came here with me, I did not delay the case, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.
44Ac 25:18 When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.
44Ac 25:19 Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive.
44Ac 25:20 I was at a loss how to investigate such matters; so I asked if he would be willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges.
44Ac 25:21 When Paul made his appeal to be held over for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him held until I could send him to Caesar."
44Ac 25:22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear this man myself." He replied, "Tomorrow you will hear him."
44Ac 25:23 The next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
44Ac 25:24 Festus said£º "King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man! The whole Jewish community has petitioned me about him in Jerusalem and here in Caesarea, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
44Ac 25:25 I found he had done nothing deserving of death, but because he made his appeal to the Emperor I decided to send him to Rome.
44Ac 25:26 But I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that as a result of this investigation I may have something to write.
44Ac 25:27 For I think it is unreasonable to send on a prisoner without specifying the charges against him."
44Ac 26:1 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." So Paul motioned with his hand and began his defense£º
44Ac 26:2 "King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as I make my defense against all the accusations of the Jews,
44Ac 26:3 and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore, I beg you to listen to me patiently.
44Ac 26:4 "The Jews all know the way I have lived ever since I was a child, from the beginning of my life in my own country, and also in Jerusalem.
44Ac 26:5 They have known me for a long time and can testify, if they are willing, that according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee.
44Ac 26:6 And now it is because of my hope in what God has promised our fathers that I am on trial today.
44Ac 26:7 This is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve God day and night. O king, it is because of this hope that the Jews are accusing me.
44Ac 26:8 Why should any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead?
44Ac 26:9 "I too was convinced that I ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
44Ac 26:10 And that is just what I did in Jerusalem. On the authority of the chief priests I put many of the saints in prison, and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.
44Ac 26:11 Many a time I went from one synagogue to another to have them punished, and I tried to force them to blaspheme. In my obsession against them, I even went to foreign cities to persecute them.
44Ac 26:12 "On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
44Ac 26:13 About noon, O king, as I was on the road, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, blazing around me and my companions.
44Ac 26:14 We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, 'Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
44Ac 26:15 "Then I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' "'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied.
44Ac 26:16 'Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what I will show you.
44Ac 26:17 I will rescue you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them
44Ac 26:18 to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'
44Ac 26:19 "So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the vision from heaven.
44Ac 26:20 First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles also, I preached that they should repent and turn to God and prove their repentance by their deeds.
44Ac 26:21 That is why the Jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me.
44Ac 26:22 But I have had God's help to this very day, and so I stand here and testify to small and great alike. I am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen--
44Ac 26:23 that the Christ would suffer and, as the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to his own people and to the Gentiles."
44Ac 26:24 At this point Festus interrupted Paul's defense. "You are out of your mind, Paul!" he shouted. "Your great learning is driving you insane."
44Ac 26:25 "I am not insane, most excellent Festus," Paul replied. "What I am saying is true and reasonable.
44Ac 26:26 The king is familiar with these things, and I can speak freely to him. I am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice, because it was not done in a corner.
44Ac 26:27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do."
44Ac 26:28 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a Christian?"
44Ac 26:29 Paul replied, "Short time or long--I pray God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains."
44Ac 26:30 The king rose, and with him the governor and Bernice and those sitting with them.
44Ac 26:31 They left the room, and while talking with one another, they said, "This man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment."
44Ac 26:32 Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44Ac 27:1 When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the Imperial Regiment.
44Ac 27:2 We boarded a ship from Adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was with us.
44Ac 27:3 The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul, allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.
44Ac 27:4 From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
44Ac 27:5 When we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
44Ac 27:6 There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board.
44Ac 27:7 We made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
44Ac 27:8 We moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.
44Ac 27:9 Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the Fast. So Paul warned them,
44Ac 27:10 "Men, I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also."
44Ac 27:11 But the centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship.
44Ac 27:12 Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on, hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete, facing both southwest and northwest.
44Ac 27:13 When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete.
44Ac 27:14 Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called the "northeaster," swept down from the island.
44Ac 27:15 The ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it and were driven along.
44Ac 27:16 As we passed to the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure.
44Ac 27:17 When the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.
44Ac 27:18 We took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard.
44Ac 27:19 On the third day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.
44Ac 27:20 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.
44Ac 27:21 After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up before them and said£º "Men, you should have taken my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss.
44Ac 27:22 But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.
44Ac 27:23 Last night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me
44Ac 27:24 and said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.'
44Ac 27:25 So keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.
44Ac 27:26 Nevertheless, we must run aground on some island."
44Ac 27:27 On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the Adriatic Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.
44Ac 27:28 They took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep. A short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep.
44Ac 27:29 Fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.
44Ac 27:30 In an attempt to escape from the ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow.
44Ac 27:31 Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved."
44Ac 27:32 So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away.
44Ac 27:33 Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. "For the last fourteen days," he said, "you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food--you haven't eaten anything.
44Ac 27:34 Now I urge you to take some food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair from his head."
44Ac 27:35 After he said this, he took some bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.
44Ac 27:36 They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves.
44Ac 27:37 Altogether there were 276 of us on board.
44Ac 27:38 When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.
44Ac 27:39 When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could.
44Ac 27:40 Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.
44Ac 27:41 But the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf.
44Ac 27:42 The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.
44Ac 27:43 But the centurion wanted to spare Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
44Ac 27:44 The rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way everyone reached land in safety.
44Ac 28:1 Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta.
44Ac 28:2 The islanders showed us unusual kindness. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold.
44Ac 28:3 Paul gathered a pile of brushwood and, as he put it on the fire, a viper, driven out by the heat, fastened itself on his hand.
44Ac 28:4 When the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, "This man must be a murderer; for though he escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live."
44Ac 28:5 But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects.
44Ac 28:6 The people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
44Ac 28:7 There was an estate nearby that belonged to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us to his home and for three days entertained us hospitably.
44Ac 28:8 His father was sick in bed, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went in to see him and, after prayer, placed his hands on him and healed him.
44Ac 28:9 When this had happened, the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured.
44Ac 28:10 They honored us in many ways and when we were ready to sail, they furnished us with the supplies we needed.
44Ac 28:11 After three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island. It was an Alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.
44Ac 28:12 We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days.
44Ac 28:13 From there we set sail and arrived at Rhegium. The next day the south wind came up, and on the following day we reached Puteoli.
44Ac 28:14 There we found some brothers who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome.
44Ac 28:15 The brothers there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these men Paul thanked God and was encouraged.
44Ac 28:16 When we got to Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.
44Ac 28:17 Three days later he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had assembled, Paul said to them£º "My brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
44Ac 28:18 They examined me and wanted to release me, because I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.
44Ac 28:19 But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar--not that I had any charge to bring against my own people.
44Ac 28:20 For this reason I have asked to see you and talk with you. It is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain."
44Ac 28:21 They replied, "We have not received any letters from Judea concerning you, and none of the brothers who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you.
44Ac 28:22 But we want to hear what your views are, for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect."
44Ac 28:23 They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying. From morning till evening he explained and declared to them the kingdom of God and tried to convince them about Jesus from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.
44Ac 28:24 Some were convinced by what he said, but others would not believe.
44Ac 28:25 They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul had made this final statement£º "The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your forefathers when he said through Isaiah the prophet£º
44Ac 28:26 "'Go to this people and say, "You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving."
44Ac 28:27 For this people's heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them.'
44Ac 28:28 "Therefore I want you to know that God's salvation has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen!"
44Ac 28:29 After he said this, the Jews left, arguing vigorously among themselves.
44Ac 28:30 For two whole years Paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him.
44Ac 28:31 Boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.
45
45Rm 1:1 Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of God--
45Rm 1:2 the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
45Rm 1:3 regarding his Son, who as to his human nature was a descendant of David,
45Rm 1:4 and who through the Spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead£º Jesus Christ our Lord.
45Rm 1:5 Through him and for his name's sake, we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith.
45Rm 1:6 And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.
45Rm 1:7 To all in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints£º Grace and peace to you from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 1:8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world.
45Rm 1:9 God, whom I serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you
45Rm 1:10 in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God's will the way may be opened for me to come to you.
45Rm 1:11 I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong--
45Rm 1:12 that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith.
45Rm 1:13 I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.
45Rm 1:14 I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.
45Rm 1:15 That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome.
45Rm 1:16 I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes£º first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
45Rm 1:17 For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written£º "The righteous will live by faith."
45Rm 1:18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,
45Rm 1:19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.
45Rm 1:20 For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.
45Rm 1:21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
45Rm 1:22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools
45Rm 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.
45Rm 1:24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
45Rm 1:25 They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator--who is forever praised. Amen.
45Rm 1:26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.
45Rm 1:27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.
45Rm 1:28 Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.
45Rm 1:29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,
45Rm 1:30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;
45Rm 1:31 they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
45Rm 1:32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
45Rm 2:1 You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.
45Rm 2:2 Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.
45Rm 2:3 So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment?
45Rm 2:4 Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance?
45Rm 2:5 But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God's wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.
45Rm 2:6 God "will give to each person according to what he has done."
45Rm 2:7 To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.
45Rm 2:8 But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.
45Rm 2:9 There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil£º first for the Jew, then for the Gentile;
45Rm 2:10 but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good£º first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
45Rm 2:11 For God does not show favoritism.
45Rm 2:12 All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.
45Rm 2:13 For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.
45Rm 2:14 (Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law,
45Rm 2:15 since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts now accusing, now even defending them.)
45Rm 2:16 This will take place on the day when God will judge men's secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares.
45Rm 2:17 Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to God;
45Rm 2:18 if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;
45Rm 2:19 if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark,
45Rm 2:20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--
45Rm 2:21 you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?
45Rm 2:22 You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
45Rm 2:23 You who brag about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
45Rm 2:24 As it is written£º "God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."
45Rm 2:25 Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.
45Rm 2:26 If those who are not circumcised keep the law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?
45Rm 2:27 The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.
45Rm 2:28 A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.
45Rm 2:29 No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God.
45Rm 3:1 What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision?
45Rm 3:2 Much in every way! First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.
45Rm 3:3 What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God's faithfulness?
45Rm 3:4 Not at all! Let God be true, and every man a liar. As it is written£º "So that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge."
45Rm 3:5 But if our unrighteousness brings out God's righteousness more clearly, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath on us? (I am using a human argument.)
45Rm 3:6 Certainly not! If that were so, how could God judge the world?
45Rm 3:7 Someone might argue, "If my falsehood enhances God's truthfulness and so increases his glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?"
45Rm 3:8 Why not say--as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say--"Let us do evil that good may result"? Their condemnation is deserved.
45Rm 3:9 What shall we conclude then? Are we any better? Not at all! We have already made the charge that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under sin.
45Rm 3:10 As it is written£º "There is no one righteous, not even one;
45Rm 3:11 there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.
45Rm 3:12 All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one."
45Rm 3:13 "Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit." "The poison of vipers is on their lips."
45Rm 3:14 "Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."
45Rm 3:15 "Their feet are swift to shed blood;
45Rm 3:16 ruin and misery mark their ways,
45Rm 3:17 and the way of peace they do not know."
45Rm 3:18 "There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45Rm 3:19 Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
45Rm 3:20 Therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of sin.
45Rm 3:21 But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.
45Rm 3:22 This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference,
45Rm 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
45Rm 3:24 and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.
45Rm 3:25 God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood. He did this to demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished--
45Rm 3:26 he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time, so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in Jesus.
45Rm 3:27 Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of observing the law? No, but on that of faith.
45Rm 3:28 For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law.
45Rm 3:29 Is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,
45Rm 3:30 since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.
45Rm 3:31 Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.
45Rm 4:1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, discovered in this matter?
45Rm 4:2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about--but not before God.
45Rm 4:3 What does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."
45Rm 4:4 Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation.
45Rm 4:5 However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.
45Rm 4:6 David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works£º
45Rm 4:7 "Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
45Rm 4:8 Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him."
45Rm 4:9 Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We have been saying that Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.
45Rm 4:10 Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it after he was circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before!
45Rm 4:11 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. So then, he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be credited to them.
45Rm 4:12 And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
45Rm 4:13 It was not through law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.
45Rm 4:14 For if those who live by law are heirs, faith has no value and the promise is worthless,
45Rm 4:15 because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.
45Rm 4:16 Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all Abraham's offspring--not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.
45Rm 4:17 As it is written£º "I have made you a father of many nations." He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed--the God who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were.
45Rm 4:18 Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, "So shall your offspring be."
45Rm 4:19 Without weakening in his faith, he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead--since he was about a hundred years old--and that Sarah's womb was also dead.
45Rm 4:20 Yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
45Rm 4:21 being fully persuaded that God had power to do what he had promised.
45Rm 4:22 This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness."
45Rm 4:23 The words "it was credited to him" were written not for him alone,
45Rm 4:24 but also for us, to whom God will credit righteousness--for us who believe in him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
45Rm 4:25 He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.
45Rm 5:1 Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
45Rm 5:2 through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.
45Rm 5:3 Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance;
45Rm 5:4 perseverance, character; and character, hope.
45Rm 5:5 And hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.
45Rm 5:6 You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.
45Rm 5:7 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die.
45Rm 5:8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this£º While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
45Rm 5:9 Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!
45Rm 5:10 For if, when we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!
45Rm 5:11 Not only is this so, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
45Rm 5:12 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned--
45Rm 5:13 for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law.
45Rm 5:14 Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come.
45Rm 5:15 But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!
45Rm 5:16 Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin£º The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification.
45Rm 5:17 For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ.
45Rm 5:18 Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men.
45Rm 5:19 For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.
45Rm 5:20 The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more,
45Rm 5:21 so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
45Rm 6:1 What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase?
45Rm 6:2 By no means! We died to sin; how can we live in it any longer?
45Rm 6:3 Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
45Rm 6:4 We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life.
45Rm 6:5 If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection.
45Rm 6:6 For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin--
45Rm 6:7 because anyone who has died has been freed from sin.
45Rm 6:8 Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
45Rm 6:9 For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him.
45Rm 6:10 The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.
45Rm 6:11 In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.
45Rm 6:12 Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires.
45Rm 6:13 Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness.
45Rm 6:14 For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.
45Rm 6:15 What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!
45Rm 6:16 Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey--whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?
45Rm 6:17 But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted.
45Rm 6:18 You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness.
45Rm 6:19 I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness.
45Rm 6:20 When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.
45Rm 6:21 What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death!
45Rm 6:22 But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life.
45Rm 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45Rm 7:1 Do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to men who know the law--that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives?
45Rm 7:2 For example, by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage.
45Rm 7:3 So then, if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an adulteress, even though she marries another man.
45Rm 7:4 So, my brothers, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God.
45Rm 7:5 For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.
45Rm 7:6 But now, by dying to what once bound us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.
45Rm 7:7 What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "Do not covet."
45Rm 7:8 But sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from law, sin is dead.
45Rm 7:9 Once I was alive apart from law; but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.
45Rm 7:10 I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
45Rm 7:11 For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.
45Rm 7:12 So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous and good.
45Rm 7:13 Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it produced death in me through what was good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.
45Rm 7:14 We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.
45Rm 7:15 I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.
45Rm 7:16 And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.
45Rm 7:17 As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me.
45Rm 7:18 I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.
45Rm 7:19 For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing.
45Rm 7:20 Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.
45Rm 7:21 So I find this law at work£º When I want to do good, evil is right there with me.
45Rm 7:22 For in my inner being I delight in God's law;
45Rm 7:23 but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.
45Rm 7:24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
45Rm 7:25 Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.
45Rm 8:1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus,
45Rm 8:2 because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death.
45Rm 8:3 For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so he condemned sin in sinful man,
45Rm 8:4 in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit.
45Rm 8:5 Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.
45Rm 8:6 The mind of sinful man is death, but the mind controlled by the Spirit is life and peace;
45Rm 8:7 the sinful mind is hostile to God. It does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.
45Rm 8:8 Those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please God.
45Rm 8:9 You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ.
45Rm 8:10 But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness.
45Rm 8:11 And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you.
45Rm 8:12 Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation--but it is not to the sinful nature, to live according to it.
45Rm 8:13 For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live,
45Rm 8:14 because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
45Rm 8:15 For you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship. And by him we cry, "Abba, Father."
45Rm 8:16 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.
45Rm 8:17 Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.
45Rm 8:18 I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
45Rm 8:19 The creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed.
45Rm 8:20 For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope
45Rm 8:21 that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of God.
45Rm 8:22 We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
45Rm 8:23 Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
45Rm 8:24 For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what he already has?
45Rm 8:25 But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently.
45Rm 8:26 In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.
45Rm 8:27 And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will.
45Rm 8:28 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.
45Rm 8:29 For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
45Rm 8:30 And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified.
45Rm 8:31 What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?
45Rm 8:32 He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?
45Rm 8:33 Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.
45Rm 8:34 Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.
45Rm 8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
45Rm 8:36 As it is written£º "For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered."
45Rm 8:37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
45Rm 8:38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,
45Rm 8:39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45Rm 9:1 I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying, my conscience confirms it in the Holy Spirit--
45Rm 9:2 I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
45Rm 9:3 For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, those of my own race,
45Rm 9:4 the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises.
45Rm 9:5 Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of Christ, who is God over all, forever praised! Amen.
45Rm 9:6 It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.
45Rm 9:7 Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham's children. On the contrary, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned."
45Rm 9:8 In other words, it is not the natural children who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring.
45Rm 9:9 For this was how the promise was stated£º "At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son."
45Rm 9:10 Not only that, but Rebekah's children had one and the same father, our father Isaac.
45Rm 9:11 Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election might stand£º
45Rm 9:12 not by works but by him who calls--she was told, "The older will serve the younger."
45Rm 9:13 Just as it is written£º "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
45Rm 9:14 What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!
45Rm 9:15 For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
45Rm 9:16 It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.
45Rm 9:17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh£º "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
45Rm 9:18 Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
45Rm 9:19 One of you will say to me£º "Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?"
45Rm 9:20 But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'"
45Rm 9:21 Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?
45Rm 9:22 What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath--prepared for destruction?
45Rm 9:23 What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory--
45Rm 9:24 even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?
45Rm 9:25 As he says in Hosea£º "I will call them 'my people' who are not my people; and I will call her 'my loved one' who is not my loved one,"
45Rm 9:26 and, "It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called 'sons of the living God.'"
45Rm 9:27 Isaiah cries out concerning Israel£º "Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved.
45Rm 9:28 For the Lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality."
45Rm 9:29 It is just as Isaiah said previously£º "Unless the Lord Almighty had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah."
45Rm 9:30 What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;
45Rm 9:31 but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.
45Rm 9:32 Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the "stumbling stone."
45Rm 9:33 As it is written£º "See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame."
45Rm 10:1 Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for the Israelites is that they may be saved.
45Rm 10:2 For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge.
45Rm 10:3 Since they did not know the righteousness that comes from God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
45Rm 10:4 Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
45Rm 10:5 Moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law£º "The man who does these things will live by them."
45Rm 10:6 But the righteousness that is by faith says£º "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'" (that is, to bring Christ down)
45Rm 10:7 "or 'Who will descend into the deep?'" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
45Rm 10:8 But what does it say? "The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart," that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming£º
45Rm 10:9 That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
45Rm 10:10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.
45Rm 10:11 As the Scripture says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame."
45Rm 10:12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him,
45Rm 10:13 for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
45Rm 10:14 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?
45Rm 10:15 And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!"
45Rm 10:16 But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our message?"
45Rm 10:17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.
45Rm 10:18 But I ask£º Did they not hear? Of course they did£º "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world."
45Rm 10:19 Again I ask£º Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says, "I will make you envious by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding."
45Rm 10:20 And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who did not seek me; I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me."
45Rm 10:21 But concerning Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people."
45Rm 11:1 I ask then£º Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.
45Rm 11:2 God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don't you know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah--how he appealed to God against Israel£º
45Rm 11:3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me"?
45Rm 11:4 And what was God's answer to him? "I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
45Rm 11:5 So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
45Rm 11:6 And if by grace, then it is no longer by works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace.
45Rm 11:7 What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,
45Rm 11:8 as it is written£º "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear, to this very day."
45Rm 11:9 And David says£º "May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them.
45Rm 11:10 May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever."
45Rm 11:11 Again I ask£º Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.
45Rm 11:12 But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!
45Rm 11:13 I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I make much of my ministry
45Rm 11:14 in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them.
45Rm 11:15 For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?
45Rm 11:16 If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.
45Rm 11:17 If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,
45Rm 11:18 do not boast over those branches. If you do, consider this£º You do not support the root, but the root supports you.
45Rm 11:19 You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in."
45Rm 11:20 Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.
45Rm 11:21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.
45Rm 11:22 Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God£º sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.
45Rm 11:23 And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.
45Rm 11:24 After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!
45Rm 11:25 I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited£º Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.
45Rm 11:26 And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written£º "The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.
45Rm 11:27 And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."
45Rm 11:28 As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies on your account; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,
45Rm 11:29 for God's gifts and his call are irrevocable.
45Rm 11:30 Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,
45Rm 11:31 so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God's mercy to you.
45Rm 11:32 For God has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.
45Rm 11:33 Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
45Rm 11:34 "Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?"
45Rm 11:35 "Who has ever given to God, that God should repay him?"
45Rm 11:36 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be the glory forever! Amen.
45Rm 12:1 Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God--this is your spiritual act of worship.
45Rm 12:2 Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is--his good, pleasing and perfect will.
45Rm 12:3 For by the grace given me I say to every one of you£º Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you.
45Rm 12:4 Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function,
45Rm 12:5 so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.
45Rm 12:6 We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. If a man's gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his faith.
45Rm 12:7 If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach;
45Rm 12:8 if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.
45Rm 12:9 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good.
45Rm 12:10 Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honor one another above yourselves.
45Rm 12:11 Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.
45Rm 12:12 Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.
45Rm 12:13 Share with God's people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
45Rm 12:14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.
45Rm 12:15 Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.
45Rm 12:16 Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.
45Rm 12:17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody.
45Rm 12:18 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
45Rm 12:19 Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written£º "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," says the Lord.
45Rm 12:20 On the contrary£º "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head."
45Rm 12:21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
45Rm 13:1 Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.
45Rm 13:2 Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.
45Rm 13:3 For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you.
45Rm 13:4 For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.
45Rm 13:5 Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience.
45Rm 13:6 This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing.
45Rm 13:7 Give everyone what you owe him£º If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.
45Rm 13:8 Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law.
45Rm 13:9 The commandments, "Do not commit adultery," "Do not murder," "Do not steal," "Do not covet," and whatever other commandment there may be, are summed up in this one rule£º "Love your neighbor as yourself."
45Rm 13:10 Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
45Rm 13:11 And do this, understanding the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
45Rm 13:12 The night is nearly over; the day is almost here. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light.
45Rm 13:13 Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in dissension and jealousy.
45Rm 13:14 Rather, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
45Rm 14:1 Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters.
45Rm 14:2 One man's faith allows him to eat everything, but another man, whose faith is weak, eats only vegetables.
45Rm 14:3 The man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not, and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does, for God has accepted him.
45Rm 14:4 Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
45Rm 14:5 One man considers one day more sacred than another; another man considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.
45Rm 14:6 He who regards one day as special, does so to the Lord. He who eats meat, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.
45Rm 14:7 For none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone.
45Rm 14:8 If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
45Rm 14:9 For this very reason, Christ died and returned to life so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.
45Rm 14:10 You, then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you look down on your brother? For we will all stand before God's judgment seat.
45Rm 14:11 It is written£º "'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me; every tongue will confess to God.'"
45Rm 14:12 So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.
45Rm 14:13 Therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother's way.
45Rm 14:14 As one who is in the Lord Jesus, I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.
45Rm 14:15 If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom Christ died.
45Rm 14:16 Do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil.
45Rm 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,
45Rm 14:18 because anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.
45Rm 14:19 Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification.
45Rm 14:20 Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.
45Rm 14:21 It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall.
45Rm 14:22 So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves.
45Rm 14:23 But the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that does not come from faith is sin.
45Rm 15:1 We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.
45Rm 15:2 Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.
45Rm 15:3 For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written£º "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me."
45Rm 15:4 For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
45Rm 15:5 May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus,
45Rm 15:6 so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 15:7 Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God.
45Rm 15:8 For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God's truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs
45Rm 15:9 so that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy, as it is written£º "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing hymns to your name."
45Rm 15:10 Again, it says, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people."
45Rm 15:11 And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and sing praises to him, all you peoples."
45Rm 15:12 And again, Isaiah says, "The Root of Jesse will spring up, one who will arise to rule over the nations; the Gentiles will hope in him."
45Rm 15:13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:14 I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, complete in knowledge and competent to instruct one another.
45Rm 15:15 I have written you quite boldly on some points, as if to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me
45Rm 15:16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:17 Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.
45Rm 15:18 I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done--
45Rm 15:19 by the power of signs and miracles, through the power of the Spirit. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.
45Rm 15:20 It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else's foundation.
45Rm 15:21 Rather, as it is written£º "Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard will understand."
45Rm 15:22 This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.
45Rm 15:23 But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to see you,
45Rm 15:24 I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to visit you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.
45Rm 15:25 Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the saints there.
45Rm 15:26 For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
45Rm 15:27 They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.
45Rm 15:28 So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this fruit, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.
45Rm 15:29 I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ.
45Rm 15:30 I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.
45Rm 15:31 Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there,
45Rm 15:32 so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.
45Rm 15:33 The God of peace be with you all. Amen.
45Rm 16:1 I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church in Cenchrea.
45Rm 16:2 I ask you to receive her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and to give her any help she may need from you, for she has been a great help to many people, including me.
45Rm 16:3 Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus.
45Rm 16:4 They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them.
45Rm 16:5 Greet also the church that meets at their house. Greet my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in the province of Asia.
45Rm 16:6 Greet Mary, who worked very hard for you.
45Rm 16:7 Greet Andronicus and Junias, my relatives who have been in prison with me. They are outstanding among the apostles, and they were in Christ before I was.
45Rm 16:8 Greet Ampliatus, whom I love in the Lord.
45Rm 16:9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
45Rm 16:10 Greet Apelles, tested and approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
45Rm 16:11 Greet Herodion, my relative. Greet those in the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
45Rm 16:12 Greet Tryphena and Tryphosa, those women who work hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, another woman who has worked very hard in the Lord.
45Rm 16:13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.
45Rm 16:14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas and the brothers with them.
45Rm 16:15 Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the saints with them.
45Rm 16:16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ send greetings.
45Rm 16:17 I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned. Keep away from them.
45Rm 16:18 For such people are not serving our Lord Christ, but their own appetites. By smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people.
45Rm 16:19 Everyone has heard about your obedience, so I am full of joy over you; but I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.
45Rm 16:20 The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
45Rm 16:21 Timothy, my fellow worker, sends his greetings to you, as do Lucius, Jason and Sosipater, my relatives.
45Rm 16:22 I, Tertius, who wrote down this letter, greet you in the Lord.
45Rm 16:23 Gaius, whose hospitality I and the whole church here enjoy, sends you his greetings. Erastus, who is the city's director of public works, and our brother Quartus send you their greetings.
45Rm 16:24 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.
45Rm 16:25 Now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,
45Rm 16:26 but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal God, so that all nations might believe and obey him--
45Rm 16:27 to the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.
46
461Co 1:1 Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,
461Co 1:2 To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ--their Lord and ours£º
461Co 1:3 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:4 I always thank God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus.
461Co 1:5 For in him you have been enriched in every way--in all your speaking and in all your knowledge--
461Co 1:6 because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.
461Co 1:7 Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed.
461Co 1:8 He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:9 God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.
461Co 1:10 I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought.
461Co 1:11 My brothers, some from Chloe's household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.
461Co 1:12 What I mean is this£º One of you says, "I follow Paul"; another, "I follow Apollos"; another, "I follow Cephas"; still another, "I follow Christ."
461Co 1:13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul?
461Co 1:14 I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
461Co 1:15 so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.
461Co 1:16 (Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.)
461Co 1:17 For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel--not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
461Co 1:18 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
461Co 1:19 For it is written£º "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate."
461Co 1:20 Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
461Co 1:21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.
461Co 1:22 Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom,
461Co 1:23 but we preach Christ crucified£º a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,
461Co 1:24 but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
461Co 1:25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength.
461Co 1:26 Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.
461Co 1:27 But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.
461Co 1:28 He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things--and the things that are not--to nullify the things that are,
461Co 1:29 so that no one may boast before him.
461Co 1:30 It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.
461Co 1:31 Therefore, as it is written£º "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."
461Co 2:1 When I came to you, brothers, I did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as I proclaimed to you the testimony about God.
461Co 2:2 For I resolved to know nothing while I was with you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
461Co 2:3 I came to you in weakness and fear, and with much trembling.
461Co 2:4 My message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words, but with a demonstration of the Spirit's power,
461Co 2:5 so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom, but on God's power.
461Co 2:6 We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.
461Co 2:7 No, we speak of God's secret wisdom, a wisdom that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began.
461Co 2:8 None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
461Co 2:9 However, as it is written£º "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him"--
461Co 2:10 but God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
461Co 2:11 For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
461Co 2:12 We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us.
461Co 2:13 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.
461Co 2:14 The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.
461Co 2:15 The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment£º
461Co 2:16 "For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.
461Co 3:1 Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly--mere infants in Christ.
461Co 3:2 I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready.
461Co 3:3 You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men?
461Co 3:4 For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere men?
461Co 3:5 What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe--as the Lord has assigned to each his task.
461Co 3:6 I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.
461Co 3:7 So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.
461Co 3:8 The man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.
461Co 3:9 For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.
461Co 3:10 By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds.
461Co 3:11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.
461Co 3:12 If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw,
461Co 3:13 his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work.
461Co 3:14 If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward.
461Co 3:15 If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.
461Co 3:16 Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?
461Co 3:17 If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple.
461Co 3:18 Do not deceive yourselves. If any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age, he should become a "fool" so that he may become wise.
461Co 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God's sight. As it is written£º "He catches the wise in their craftiness";
461Co 3:20 and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile."
461Co 3:21 So then, no more boasting about men! All things are yours,
461Co 3:22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future--all are yours,
461Co 3:23 and you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.
461Co 4:1 So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of God.
461Co 4:2 Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.
461Co 4:3 I care very little if I am judged by you or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.
461Co 4:4 My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me.
461Co 4:5 Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait till the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men's hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.
461Co 4:6 Now, brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying, "Do not go beyond what is written." Then you will not take pride in one man over against another.
461Co 4:7 For who makes you different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?
461Co 4:8 Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! You have become kings--and that without us! How I wish that you really had become kings so that we might be kings with you!
461Co 4:9 For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession, like men condemned to die in the arena. We have been made a spectacle to the whole universe, to angels as well as to men.
461Co 4:10 We are fools for Christ, but you are so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, we are dishonored!
461Co 4:11 To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we are in rags, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.
461Co 4:12 We work hard with our own hands. When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;
461Co 4:13 when we are slandered, we answer kindly. Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.
461Co 4:14 I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you, as my dear children.
461Co 4:15 Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
461Co 4:16 Therefore I urge you to imitate me.
461Co 4:17 For this reason I am sending to you Timothy, my son whom I love, who is faithful in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church.
461Co 4:18 Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.
461Co 4:19 But I will come to you very soon, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking, but what power they have.
461Co 4:20 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.
461Co 4:21 What do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a whip, or in love and with a gentle spirit?
461Co 5:1 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans£º A man has his father's wife.
461Co 5:2 And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this?
461Co 5:3 Even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. And I have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.
461Co 5:4 When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,
461Co 5:5 hand this man over to Satan, so that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the Lord.
461Co 5:6 Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?
461Co 5:7 Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast--as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
461Co 5:8 Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old yeast, the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with bread without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth.
461Co 5:9 I have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people--
461Co 5:10 not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.
461Co 5:11 But now I am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.
461Co 5:12 What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?
461Co 5:13 God will judge those outside. "Expel the wicked man from among you."
461Co 6:1 If any of you has a dispute with another, dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints?
461Co 6:2 Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if you are to judge the world, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?
461Co 6:3 Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more the things of this life!
461Co 6:4 Therefore, if you have disputes about such matters, appoint as judges even men of little account in the church!
461Co 6:5 I say this to shame you. Is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers?
461Co 6:6 But instead, one brother goes to law against another--and this in front of unbelievers!
461Co 6:7 The very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?
461Co 6:8 Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong, and you do this to your brothers.
461Co 6:9 Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived£º Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders
461Co 6:10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
461Co 6:11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
461Co 6:12 "Everything is permissible for me"--but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is permissible for me"--but I will not be mastered by anything.
461Co 6:13 "Food for the stomach and the stomach for food"--but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
461Co 6:14 By his power God raised the Lord from the dead, and he will raise us also.
461Co 6:15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!
461Co 6:16 Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh."
461Co 6:17 But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit.
461Co 6:18 Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.
461Co 6:19 Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;
461Co 6:20 you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body.
461Co 7:1 Now for the matters you wrote about£º It is good for a man not to marry.
461Co 7:2 But since there is so much immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.
461Co 7:3 The husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.
461Co 7:4 The wife's body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband. In the same way, the husband's body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife.
461Co 7:5 Do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
461Co 7:6 I say this as a concession, not as a command.
461Co 7:7 I wish that all men were as I am. But each man has his own gift from God; one has this gift, another has that.
461Co 7:8 Now to the unmarried and the widows I say£º It is good for them to stay unmarried, as I am.
461Co 7:9 But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
461Co 7:10 To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord)£º A wife must not separate from her husband.
461Co 7:11 But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.
461Co 7:12 To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord)£º If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her.
461Co 7:13 And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him.
461Co 7:14 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
461Co 7:15 But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace.
461Co 7:16 How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
461Co 7:17 Nevertheless, each one should retain the place in life that the Lord assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is the rule I lay down in all the churches.
461Co 7:18 Was a man already circumcised when he was called? He should not become uncircumcised. Was a man uncircumcised when he was called? He should not be circumcised.
461Co 7:19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping God's commands is what counts.
461Co 7:20 Each one should remain in the situation which he was in when God called him.
461Co 7:21 Were you a slave when you were called? Don't let it trouble you--although if you can gain your freedom, do so.
461Co 7:22 For he who was a slave when he was called by the Lord is the Lord's freedman; similarly, he who was a free man when he was called is Christ's slave.
461Co 7:23 You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.
461Co 7:24 Brothers, each man, as responsible to God, should remain in the situation God called him to.
461Co 7:25 Now about virgins£º I have no command from the Lord, but I give a judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
461Co 7:26 Because of the present crisis, I think that it is good for you to remain as you are.
461Co 7:27 Are you married? Do not seek a divorce. Are you unmarried? Do not look for a wife.
461Co 7:28 But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face many troubles in this life, and I want to spare you this.
461Co 7:29 What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none;
461Co 7:30 those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep;
461Co 7:31 those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.
461Co 7:32 I would like you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the Lord's affairs--how he can please the Lord.
461Co 7:33 But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world--how he can please his wife--
461Co 7:34 and his interests are divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the Lord's affairs£º Her aim is to be devoted to the Lord in both body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world--how she can please her husband.
461Co 7:35 I am saying this for your own good, not to restrict you, but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the Lord.
461Co 7:36 If anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry, he should do as he wants. He is not sinning. They should get married.
461Co 7:37 But the man who has settled the matter in his own mind, who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will, and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin--this man also does the right thing.
461Co 7:38 So then, he who marries the virgin does right, but he who does not marry her does even better.
461Co 7:39 A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord.
461Co 7:40 In my judgment, she is happier if she stays as she is--and I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
461Co 8:1 Now about food sacrificed to idols£º We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
461Co 8:2 The man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know.
461Co 8:3 But the man who loves God is known by God.
461Co 8:4 So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols£º We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one.
461Co 8:5 For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"),
461Co 8:6 yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.
461Co 8:7 But not everyone knows this. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled.
461Co 8:8 But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.
461Co 8:9 Be careful, however, that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak.
461Co 8:10 For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, won't he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols?
461Co 8:11 So this weak brother, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge.
461Co 8:12 When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
461Co 8:13 Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause him to fall.
461Co 9:1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord?
461Co 9:2 Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
461Co 9:3 This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me.
461Co 9:4 Don't we have the right to food and drink?
461Co 9:5 Don't we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas?
461Co 9:6 Or is it only I and Barnabas who must work for a living?
461Co 9:7 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk?
461Co 9:8 Do I say this merely from a human point of view? Doesn't the Law say the same thing?
461Co 9:9 For it is written in the Law of Moses£º "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." Is it about oxen that God is concerned?
461Co 9:10 Surely he says this for us, doesn't he? Yes, this was written for us, because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes, they ought to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest.
461Co 9:11 If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?
461Co 9:12 If others have this right of support from you, shouldn't we have it all the more? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ.
461Co 9:13 Don't you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar?
461Co 9:14 In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.
461Co 9:15 But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me. I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of this boast.
461Co 9:16 Yet when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, for I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
461Co 9:17 If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me.
461Co 9:18 What then is my reward? Just this£º that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make use of my rights in preaching it.
461Co 9:19 Though I am free and belong to no man, I make myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible.
461Co 9:20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law.
461Co 9:21 To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God's law but am under Christ's law), so as to win those not having the law.
461Co 9:22 To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some.
461Co 9:23 I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.
461Co 9:24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.
461Co 9:25 Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.
461Co 9:26 Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the air.
461Co 9:27 No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.
461Co 10:1 For I do not want you to be ignorant of the fact, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea.
461Co 10:2 They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
461Co 10:3 They all ate the same spiritual food
461Co 10:4 and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.
461Co 10:5 Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them; their bodies were scattered over the desert.
461Co 10:6 Now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did.
461Co 10:7 Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written£º "The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry."
461Co 10:8 We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did--and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died.
461Co 10:9 We should not test the Lord, as some of them did--and were killed by snakes.
461Co 10:10 And do not grumble, as some of them did--and were killed by the destroying angel.
461Co 10:11 These things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come.
461Co 10:12 So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall!
461Co 10:13 No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.
461Co 10:14 Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.
461Co 10:15 I speak to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
461Co 10:16 Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?
461Co 10:17 Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all partake of the one loaf.
461Co 10:18 Consider the people of Israel£º Do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?
461Co 10:19 Do I mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?
461Co 10:20 No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons.
461Co 10:21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot have a part in both the Lord's table and the table of demons.
461Co 10:22 Are we trying to arouse the Lord's jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
461Co 10:23 "Everything is permissible"--but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is permissible"--but not everything is constructive.
461Co 10:24 Nobody should seek his own good, but the good of others.
461Co 10:25 Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,
461Co 10:26 for, "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it."
461Co 10:27 If some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience.
461Co 10:28 But if anyone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience' sake--
461Co 10:29 the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?
461Co 10:30 If I take part in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of something I thank God for?
461Co 10:31 So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
461Co 10:32 Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews, Greeks or the church of God--
461Co 10:33 even as I try to please everybody in every way. For I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved.
461Co 11:1 Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.
461Co 11:2 I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings, just as I passed them on to you.
461Co 11:3 Now I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.
461Co 11:4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.
461Co 11:5 And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head--it is just as though her head were shaved.
461Co 11:6 If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off; and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.
461Co 11:7 A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.
461Co 11:8 For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;
461Co 11:9 neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
461Co 11:10 For this reason, and because of the angels, the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head.
461Co 11:11 In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.
461Co 11:12 For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.
461Co 11:13 Judge for yourselves£º Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?
461Co 11:14 Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,
461Co 11:15 but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.
461Co 11:16 If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice--nor do the churches of God.
461Co 11:17 In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.
461Co 11:18 In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.
461Co 11:19 No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.
461Co 11:20 When you come together, it is not the Lord's Supper you eat,
461Co 11:21 for as you eat, each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else. One remains hungry, another gets drunk.
461Co 11:22 Don't you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? Certainly not!
461Co 11:23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you£º The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread,
461Co 11:24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."
461Co 11:25 In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."
461Co 11:26 For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
461Co 11:27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
461Co 11:28 A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.
461Co 11:29 For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.
461Co 11:30 That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.
461Co 11:31 But if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment.
461Co 11:32 When we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.
461Co 11:33 So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for each other.
461Co 11:34 If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. And when I come I will give further directions.
461Co 12:1 Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.
461Co 12:2 You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.
461Co 12:3 Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
461Co 12:4 There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.
461Co 12:5 There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.
461Co 12:6 There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men.
461Co 12:7 Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
461Co 12:8 To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,
461Co 12:9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,
461Co 12:10 to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.
461Co 12:11 All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines.
461Co 12:12 The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ.
461Co 12:13 For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body--whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free--and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.
461Co 12:14 Now the body is not made up of one part but of many.
461Co 12:15 If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body.
461Co 12:16 And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body.
461Co 12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
461Co 12:18 But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.
461Co 12:19 If they were all one part, where would the body be?
461Co 12:20 As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
461Co 12:21 The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!"
461Co 12:22 On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
461Co 12:23 and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,
461Co 12:24 while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it,
461Co 12:25 so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.
461Co 12:26 If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
461Co 12:27 Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
461Co 12:28 And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues.
461Co 12:29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
461Co 12:30 Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
461Co 12:31 But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.
461Co 13:1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.
461Co 13:2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
461Co 13:3 If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing.
461Co 13:4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
461Co 13:5 It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
461Co 13:6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.
461Co 13:7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
461Co 13:8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.
461Co 13:9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
461Co 13:10 but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears.
461Co 13:11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.
461Co 13:12 Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
461Co 13:13 And now these three remain£º faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
461Co 14:1 Follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy.
461Co 14:2 For anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God. Indeed, no one understands him; he utters mysteries with his spirit.
461Co 14:3 But everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening, encouragement and comfort.
461Co 14:4 He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.
461Co 14:5 I would like every one of you to speak in tongues, but I would rather have you prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.
461Co 14:6 Now, brothers, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction?
461Co 14:7 Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the flute or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes?
461Co 14:8 Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?
461Co 14:9 So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.
461Co 14:10 Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.
461Co 14:11 If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and he is a foreigner to me.
461Co 14:12 So it is with you. Since you are eager to have spiritual gifts, try to excel in gifts that build up the church.
461Co 14:13 For this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says.
461Co 14:14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
461Co 14:15 So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind.
461Co 14:16 If you are praising God with your spirit, how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?
461Co 14:17 You may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.
461Co 14:18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
461Co 14:19 But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue.
461Co 14:20 Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults.
461Co 14:21 In the Law it is written£º "Through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me," says the Lord.
461Co 14:22 Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers.
461Co 14:23 So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind?
461Co 14:24 But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all,
461Co 14:25 and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"
461Co 14:26 What then shall we say, brothers? When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church.
461Co 14:27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, two--or at the most three--should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret.
461Co 14:28 If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and God.
461Co 14:29 Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.
461Co 14:30 And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop.
461Co 14:31 For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged.
461Co 14:32 The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets.
461Co 14:33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the congregations of the saints,
461Co 14:34 women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says.
461Co 14:35 If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
461Co 14:36 Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?
461Co 14:37 If anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.
461Co 14:38 If he ignores this, he himself will be ignored.
461Co 14:39 Therefore, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
461Co 14:40 But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way.
461Co 15:1 Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand.
461Co 15:2 By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.
461Co 15:3 For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance£º that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
461Co 15:4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,
461Co 15:5 and that he appeared to Peter, and then to the Twelve.
461Co 15:6 After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep.
461Co 15:7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,
461Co 15:8 and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born.
461Co 15:9 For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
461Co 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them--yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
461Co 15:11 Whether, then, it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.
461Co 15:12 But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
461Co 15:13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
461Co 15:14 And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.
461Co 15:15 More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised.
461Co 15:16 For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either.
461Co 15:17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.
461Co 15:18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost.
461Co 15:19 If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men.
461Co 15:20 But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
461Co 15:21 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
461Co 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
461Co 15:23 But each in his own turn£º Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.
461Co 15:24 Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.
461Co 15:25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
461Co 15:26 The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
461Co 15:27 For he "has put everything under his feet." Now when it says that "everything" has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ.
461Co 15:28 When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.
461Co 15:29 Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them?
461Co 15:30 And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour?
461Co 15:31 I die every day--I mean that, brothers--just as surely as I glory over you in Christ Jesus our Lord.
461Co 15:32 If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
461Co 15:33 Do not be misled£º "Bad company corrupts good character."
461Co 15:34 Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God--I say this to your shame.
461Co 15:35 But someone may ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?"
461Co 15:36 How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
461Co 15:37 When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else.
461Co 15:38 But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.
461Co 15:39 All flesh is not the same£º Men have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another.
461Co 15:40 There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another.
461Co 15:41 The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor.
461Co 15:42 So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable;
461Co 15:43 it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;
461Co 15:44 it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
461Co 15:45 So it is written£º "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.
461Co 15:46 The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.
461Co 15:47 The first man was of the dust of the earth, the second man from heaven.
461Co 15:48 As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the man from heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.
461Co 15:49 And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven.
461Co 15:50 I declare to you, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
461Co 15:51 Listen, I tell you a mystery£º We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed--
461Co 15:52 in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.
461Co 15:53 For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.
461Co 15:54 When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true£º "Death has been swallowed up in victory."
461Co 15:55 "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?"
461Co 15:56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
461Co 15:57 But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 15:58 Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
461Co 16:1 Now about the collection for God's people£º Do what I told the Galatian churches to do.
461Co 16:2 On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made.
461Co 16:3 Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem.
461Co 16:4 If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me.
461Co 16:5 After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you--for I will be going through Macedonia.
461Co 16:6 Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.
461Co 16:7 I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
461Co 16:8 But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost,
461Co 16:9 because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me.
461Co 16:10 If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am.
461Co 16:11 No one, then, should refuse to accept him. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers.
461Co 16:12 Now about our brother Apollos£º I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.
461Co 16:13 Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage; be strong.
461Co 16:14 Do everything in love.
461Co 16:15 You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. I urge you, brothers,
461Co 16:16 to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work, and labors at it.
461Co 16:17 I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.
461Co 16:18 For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition.
461Co 16:19 The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.
461Co 16:20 All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
461Co 16:21 I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.
461Co 16:22 If anyone does not love the Lord--a curse be on him. Come, O Lord!
461Co 16:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
461Co 16:24 My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.
47
472Co 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God in Corinth, together with all the saints throughout Achaia£º
472Co 1:2 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
472Co 1:3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort,
472Co 1:4 who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from God.
472Co 1:5 For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows.
472Co 1:6 If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.
472Co 1:7 And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort.
472Co 1:8 We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about the hardships we suffered in the province of Asia. We were under great pressure, far beyond our ability to endure, so that we despaired even of life.
472Co 1:9 Indeed, in our hearts we felt the sentence of death. But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.
472Co 1:10 He has delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us,
472Co 1:11 as you help us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many.
472Co 1:12 Now this is our boast£º Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the holiness and sincerity that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to God's grace.
472Co 1:13 For we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand. And I hope that,
472Co 1:14 as you have understood us in part, you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the Lord Jesus.
472Co 1:15 Because I was confident of this, I planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice.
472Co 1:16 I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.
472Co 1:17 When I planned this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath I say, "Yes, yes" and "No, no"?
472Co 1:18 But as surely as God is faithful, our message to you is not "Yes" and "No."
472Co 1:19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by me and Silas and Timothy, was not "Yes" and "No," but in him it has always been "Yes."
472Co 1:20 For no matter how many promises God has made, they are "Yes" in Christ. And so through him the "Amen" is spoken by us to the glory of God.
472Co 1:21 Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us,
472Co 1:22 set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
472Co 1:23 I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
472Co 1:24 Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, because it is by faith you stand firm.
472Co 2:1 So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you.
472Co 2:2 For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved?
472Co 2:3 I wrote as I did so that when I came I should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy.
472Co 2:4 For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you.
472Co 2:5 If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you, to some extent--not to put it too severely.
472Co 2:6 The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him.
472Co 2:7 Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
472Co 2:8 I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him.
472Co 2:9 The reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything.
472Co 2:10 If you forgive anyone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven--if there was anything to forgive--I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake,
472Co 2:11 in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes.
472Co 2:12 Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me,
472Co 2:13 I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-by to them and went on to Macedonia.
472Co 2:14 But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him.
472Co 2:15 For we are to God the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing.
472Co 2:16 To the one we are the smell of death; to the other, the fragrance of life. And who is equal to such a task?
472Co 2:17 Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, like men sent from God.
472Co 3:1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some people, letters of recommendation to you or from you?
472Co 3:2 You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everybody.
472Co 3:3 You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
472Co 3:4 Such confidence as this is ours through Christ before God.
472Co 3:5 Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God.
472Co 3:6 He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant--not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
472Co 3:7 Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, fading though it was,
472Co 3:8 will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious?
472Co 3:9 If the ministry that condemns men is glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness!
472Co 3:10 For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory.
472Co 3:11 And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!
472Co 3:12 Therefore, since we have such a hope, we are very bold.
472Co 3:13 We are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away.
472Co 3:14 But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away.
472Co 3:15 Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.
472Co 3:16 But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
472Co 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
472Co 3:18 And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his likeness with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
472Co 4:1 Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart.
472Co 4:2 Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
472Co 4:3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.
472Co 4:4 The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
472Co 4:5 For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.
472Co 4:6 For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
472Co 4:7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.
472Co 4:8 We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;
472Co 4:9 persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.
472Co 4:10 We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
472Co 4:11 For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body.
472Co 4:12 So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
472Co 4:13 It is written£º "I believed; therefore I have spoken." With that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak,
472Co 4:14 because we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in his presence.
472Co 4:15 All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.
472Co 4:16 Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.
472Co 4:17 For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.
472Co 4:18 So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.
472Co 5:1 Now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.
472Co 5:2 Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling,
472Co 5:3 because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked.
472Co 5:4 For while we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
472Co 5:5 Now it is God who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.
472Co 5:6 Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord.
472Co 5:7 We live by faith, not by sight.
472Co 5:8 We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
472Co 5:9 So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it.
472Co 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.
472Co 5:11 Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade men. What we are is plain to God, and I hope it is also plain to your conscience.
472Co 5:12 We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us, so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart.
472Co 5:13 If we are out of our mind, it is for the sake of God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
472Co 5:14 For Christ's love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and therefore all died.
472Co 5:15 And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again.
472Co 5:16 So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer.
472Co 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!
472Co 5:18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation£º
472Co 5:19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.
472Co 5:20 We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ's behalf£º Be reconciled to God.
472Co 5:21 God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
472Co 6:1 As God's fellow workers we urge you not to receive God's grace in vain.
472Co 6:2 For he says, "In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you." I tell you, now is the time of God's favor, now is the day of salvation.
472Co 6:3 We put no stumbling block in anyone's path, so that our ministry will not be discredited.
472Co 6:4 Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way£º in great endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;
472Co 6:5 in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights and hunger;
472Co 6:6 in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the Holy Spirit and in sincere love;
472Co 6:7 in truthful speech and in the power of God; with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left;
472Co 6:8 through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet regarded as impostors;
472Co 6:9 known, yet regarded as unknown; dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;
472Co 6:10 sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything.
472Co 6:11 We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.
472Co 6:12 We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.
472Co 6:13 As a fair exchange--I speak as to my children--open wide your hearts also.
472Co 6:14 Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?
472Co 6:15 What harmony is there between Christ and Belial? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?
472Co 6:16 What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said£º "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people."
472Co 6:17 "Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you."
472Co 6:18 "I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty."
472Co 7:1 Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
472Co 7:2 Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have exploited no one.
472Co 7:3 I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you.
472Co 7:4 I have great confidence in you; I take great pride in you. I am greatly encouraged; in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds.
472Co 7:5 For when we came into Macedonia, this body of ours had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn--conflicts on the outside, fears within.
472Co 7:6 But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,
472Co 7:7 and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him. He told us about your longing for me, your deep sorrow, your ardent concern for me, so that my joy was greater than ever.
472Co 7:8 Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret it--I see that my letter hurt you, but only for a little while--
472Co 7:9 yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us.
472Co 7:10 Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.
472Co 7:11 See what this godly sorrow has produced in you£º what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what concern, what readiness to see justice done. At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.
472Co 7:12 So even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party, but rather that before God you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are.
472Co 7:13 By all this we are encouraged. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you.
472Co 7:14 I had boasted to him about you, and you have not embarrassed me. But just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true as well.
472Co 7:15 And his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient, receiving him with fear and trembling.
472Co 7:16 I am glad I can have complete confidence in you.
472Co 8:1 And now, brothers, we want you to know about the grace that God has given the Macedonian churches.
472Co 8:2 Out of the most severe trial, their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.
472Co 8:3 For I testify that they gave as much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,
472Co 8:4 they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints.
472Co 8:5 And they did not do as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us in keeping with God's will.
472Co 8:6 So we urged Titus, since he had earlier made a beginning, to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part.
472Co 8:7 But just as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in complete earnestness and in your love for us--see that you also excel in this grace of giving.
472Co 8:8 I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.
472Co 8:9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.
472Co 8:10 And here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter£º Last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so.
472Co 8:11 Now finish the work, so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it, according to your means.
472Co 8:12 For if the willingness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what one has, not according to what he does not have.
472Co 8:13 Our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed, but that there might be equality.
472Co 8:14 At the present time your plenty will supply what they need, so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need. Then there will be equality,
472Co 8:15 as it is written£º "He who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little."
472Co 8:16 I thank God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.
472Co 8:17 For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative.
472Co 8:18 And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel.
472Co 8:19 What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help.
472Co 8:20 We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift.
472Co 8:21 For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men.
472Co 8:22 In addition, we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so because of his great confidence in you.
472Co 8:23 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.
472Co 8:24 Therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you, so that the churches can see it.
472Co 9:1 There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the saints.
472Co 9:2 For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.
472Co 9:3 But I am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you may be ready, as I said you would be.
472Co 9:4 For if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we--not to say anything about you--would be ashamed of having been so confident.
472Co 9:5 So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised. Then it will be ready as a generous gift, not as one grudgingly given.
472Co 9:6 Remember this£º Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
472Co 9:7 Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
472Co 9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.
472Co 9:9 As it is written£º "He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever."
472Co 9:10 Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
472Co 9:11 You will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God.
472Co 9:12 This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of God's people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
472Co 9:13 Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, men will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else.
472Co 9:14 And in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you, because of the surpassing grace God has given you.
472Co 9:15 Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
472Co 10:1 By the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you--I, Paul, who am "timid" when face to face with you, but "bold" when away!
472Co 10:2 I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world.
472Co 10:3 For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.
472Co 10:4 The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.
472Co 10:5 We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.
472Co 10:6 And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.
472Co 10:7 You are looking only on the surface of things. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as he.
472Co 10:8 For even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than pulling you down, I will not be ashamed of it.
472Co 10:9 I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters.
472Co 10:10 For some say, "His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing."
472Co 10:11 Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.
472Co 10:12 We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise.
472Co 10:13 We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the field God has assigned to us, a field that reaches even to you.
472Co 10:14 We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ.
472Co 10:15 Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our area of activity among you will greatly expand,
472Co 10:16 so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in another man's territory.
472Co 10:17 But, "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."
472Co 10:18 For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
472Co 11:1 I hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness; but you are already doing that.
472Co 11:2 I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.
472Co 11:3 But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
472Co 11:4 For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.
472Co 11:5 But I do not think I am in the least inferior to those "super-apostles."
472Co 11:6 I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way.
472Co 11:7 Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge?
472Co 11:8 I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you.
472Co 11:9 And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.
472Co 11:10 As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine.
472Co 11:11 Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
472Co 11:12 And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about.
472Co 11:13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ.
472Co 11:14 And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.
472Co 11:15 It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve.
472Co 11:16 I repeat£º Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then receive me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting.
472Co 11:17 In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool.
472Co 11:18 Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast.
472Co 11:19 You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise!
472Co 11:20 In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face.
472Co 11:21 To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! What anyone else dares to boast about--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast about.
472Co 11:22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I.
472Co 11:23 Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again.
472Co 11:24 Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.
472Co 11:25 Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea,
472Co 11:26 I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers.
472Co 11:27 I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked.
472Co 11:28 Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches.
472Co 11:29 Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?
472Co 11:30 If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
472Co 11:31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying.
472Co 11:32 In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me.
472Co 11:33 But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands.
472Co 12:1 I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.
472Co 12:2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know--God knows.
472Co 12:3 And I know that this man--whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows--
472Co 12:4 was caught up to paradise. He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell.
472Co 12:5 I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses.
472Co 12:6 Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say.
472Co 12:7 To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.
472Co 12:8 Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me.
472Co 12:9 But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.
472Co 12:10 That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
472Co 12:11 I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the "super-apostles," even though I am nothing.
472Co 12:12 The things that mark an apostle--signs, wonders and miracles--were done among you with great perseverance.
472Co 12:13 How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!
472Co 12:14 Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
472Co 12:15 So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?
472Co 12:16 Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery!
472Co 12:17 Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent you?
472Co 12:18 I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not act in the same spirit and follow the same course?
472Co 12:19 Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening.
472Co 12:20 For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder.
472Co 12:21 I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged.
472Co 13:1 This will be my third visit to you. "Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses."
472Co 13:2 I already gave you a warning when I was with you the second time. I now repeat it while absent£º On my return I will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others,
472Co 13:3 since you are demanding proof that Christ is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.
472Co 13:4 For to be sure, he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God's power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by God's power we will live with him to serve you.
472Co 13:5 Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you--unless, of course, you fail the test?
472Co 13:6 And I trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test.
472Co 13:7 Now we pray to God that you will not do anything wrong. Not that people will see that we have stood the test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed.
472Co 13:8 For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
472Co 13:9 We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is for your perfection.
472Co 13:10 This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I may not have to be harsh in my use of authority--the authority the Lord gave me for building you up, not for tearing you down.
472Co 13:11 Finally, brothers, good-by. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.
472Co 13:12 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
472Co 13:13 All the saints send their greetings.
472Co 13:14 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

48Gl 1:1 Paul, an apostle--sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead--
48Gl 1:2 and all the brothers with me, To the churches in Galatia£º
48Gl 1:3 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
48Gl 1:4 who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
48Gl 1:5 to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
48Gl 1:6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--
48Gl 1:7 which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.
48Gl 1:8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned!
48Gl 1:9 As we have already said, so now I say again£º If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!
48Gl 1:10 Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.
48Gl 1:11 I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.
48Gl 1:12 I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.
48Gl 1:13 For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.
48Gl 1:14 I was advancing in Judaism beyond many Jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
48Gl 1:15 But when God, who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace, was pleased
48Gl 1:16 to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not consult any man,
48Gl 1:17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went immediately into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.
48Gl 1:18 Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter and stayed with him fifteen days.
48Gl 1:19 I saw none of the other apostles--only James, the Lord's brother.
48Gl 1:20 I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie.
48Gl 1:21 Later I went to Syria and Cilicia.
48Gl 1:22 I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
48Gl 1:23 They only heard the report£º "The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."
48Gl 1:24 And they praised God because of me.
48Gl 2:1 Fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem, this time with Barnabas. I took Titus along also.
48Gl 2:2 I went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders, for fear that I was running or had run my race in vain.
48Gl 2:3 Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.
48Gl 2:4 This matter arose because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus and to make us slaves.
48Gl 2:5 We did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.
48Gl 2:6 As for those who seemed to be important--whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not judge by external appearance--those men added nothing to my message.
48Gl 2:7 On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as Peter had been to the Jews.
48Gl 2:8 For God, who was at work in the ministry of Peter as an apostle to the Jews, was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the Gentiles.
48Gl 2:9 James, Peter and John, those reputed to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the Jews.
48Gl 2:10 All they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.
48Gl 2:11 When Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong.
48Gl 2:12 Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he began to draw back and separate himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group.
48Gl 2:13 The other Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that by their hypocrisy even Barnabas was led astray.
48Gl 2:14 When I saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter in front of them all, "You are a Jew, yet you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. How is it, then, that you force Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?
48Gl 2:15 "We who are Jews by birth and not 'Gentile sinners'
48Gl 2:16 know that a man is not justified by observing the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by observing the law, because by observing the law no one will be justified.
48Gl 2:17 "If, while we seek to be justified in Christ, it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners, does that mean that Christ promotes sin? Absolutely not!
48Gl 2:18 If I rebuild what I destroyed, I prove that I am a lawbreaker.
48Gl 2:19 For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God.
48Gl 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
48Gl 2:21 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!"
48Gl 3:1 You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.
48Gl 3:2 I would like to learn just one thing from you£º Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law, or by believing what you heard?
48Gl 3:3 Are you so foolish? After beginning with the Spirit, are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort?
48Gl 3:4 Have you suffered so much for nothing--if it really was for nothing?
48Gl 3:5 Does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you because you observe the law, or because you believe what you heard?
48Gl 3:6 Consider Abraham£º "He believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."
48Gl 3:7 Understand, then, that those who believe are children of Abraham.
48Gl 3:8 The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham£º "All nations will be blessed through you."
48Gl 3:9 So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
48Gl 3:10 All who rely on observing the law are under a curse, for it is written£º "Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law."
48Gl 3:11 Clearly no one is justified before God by the law, because, "The righteous will live by faith."
48Gl 3:12 The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, "The man who does these things will live by them."
48Gl 3:13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written£º "Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree."
48Gl 3:14 He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.
48Gl 3:15 Brothers, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case.
48Gl 3:16 The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say "and to seeds," meaning many people, but "and to your seed," meaning one person, who is Christ.
48Gl 3:17 What I mean is this£º The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise.
48Gl 3:18 For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise.
48Gl 3:19 What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was put into effect through angels by a mediator.
48Gl 3:20 A mediator, however, does not represent just one party; but God is one.
48Gl 3:21 Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.
48Gl 3:22 But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.
48Gl 3:23 Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.
48Gl 3:24 So the law was put in charge to lead us to Christ that we might be justified by faith.
48Gl 3:25 Now that faith has come, we are no longer under the supervision of the law.
48Gl 3:26 You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus,
48Gl 3:27 for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
48Gl 3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
48Gl 3:29 If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.
48Gl 4:1 What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate.
48Gl 4:2 He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.
48Gl 4:3 So also, when we were children, we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world.
48Gl 4:4 But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law,
48Gl 4:5 to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons.
48Gl 4:6 Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, "Abba , Father."
48Gl 4:7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and since you are a son, God has made you also an heir.
48Gl 4:8 Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods.
48Gl 4:9 But now that you know God--or rather are known by God--how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again?
48Gl 4:10 You are observing special days and months and seasons and years!
48Gl 4:11 I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you.
48Gl 4:12 I plead with you, brothers, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.
48Gl 4:13 As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.
48Gl 4:14 Even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself.
48Gl 4:15 What has happened to all your joy? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
48Gl 4:16 Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?
48Gl 4:17 Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may be zealous for them.
48Gl 4:18 It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always and not just when I am with you.
48Gl 4:19 My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,
48Gl 4:20 how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you!
48Gl 4:21 Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says?
48Gl 4:22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman.
48Gl 4:23 His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise.
48Gl 4:24 These things may be taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves£º This is Hagar.
48Gl 4:25 Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.
48Gl 4:26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.
48Gl 4:27 For it is written£º "Be glad, O barren woman, who bears no children; break forth and cry aloud, you who have no labor pains; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband."
48Gl 4:28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
48Gl 4:29 At that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now.
48Gl 4:30 But what does the Scripture say? "Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman's son."
48Gl 4:31 Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
48Gl 5:1 It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.
48Gl 5:2 Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all.
48Gl 5:3 Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law.
48Gl 5:4 You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.
48Gl 5:5 But by faith we eagerly await through the Spirit the righteousness for which we hope.
48Gl 5:6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.
48Gl 5:7 You were running a good race. Who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth?
48Gl 5:8 That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
48Gl 5:9 "A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough."
48Gl 5:10 I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty, whoever he may be.
48Gl 5:11 Brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished.
48Gl 5:12 As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!
48Gl 5:13 You, my brothers, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather, serve one another in love.
48Gl 5:14 The entire law is summed up in a single command£º "Love your neighbor as yourself."
48Gl 5:15 If you keep on biting and devouring each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other.
48Gl 5:16 So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.
48Gl 5:17 For the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature. They are in conflict with each other, so that you do not do what you want.
48Gl 5:18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.
48Gl 5:19 The acts of the sinful nature are obvious£º sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery;
48Gl 5:20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions
48Gl 5:21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.
48Gl 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
48Gl 5:23 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.
48Gl 5:24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires.
48Gl 5:25 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.
48Gl 5:26 Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other.
48Gl 6:1 Brothers, if someone is caught in a sin, you who are spiritual should restore him gently. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.
48Gl 6:2 Carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
48Gl 6:3 If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
48Gl 6:4 Each one should test his own actions. Then he can take pride in himself, without comparing himself to somebody else,
48Gl 6:5 for each one should carry his own load.
48Gl 6:6 Anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor.
48Gl 6:7 Do not be deceived£º God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.
48Gl 6:8 The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.
48Gl 6:9 Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.
48Gl 6:10 Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
48Gl 6:11 See what large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!
48Gl 6:12 Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. The only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.
48Gl 6:13 Not even those who are circumcised obey the law, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh.
48Gl 6:14 May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
48Gl 6:15 Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation.
48Gl 6:16 Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, even to the Israel of God.
48Gl 6:17 Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
48Gl 6:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.
49
49Eph 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus£º
49Eph 1:2 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 1:3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.
49Eph 1:4 For he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight. In love
49Eph 1:5 he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, in accordance with his pleasure and will--
49Eph 1:6 to the praise of his glorious grace, which he has freely given us in the One he loves.
49Eph 1:7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace
49Eph 1:8 that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.
49Eph 1:9 And he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ,
49Eph 1:10 to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment--to bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head, even Christ.
49Eph 1:11 In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will,
49Eph 1:12 in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, might be for the praise of his glory.
49Eph 1:13 And you also were included in Christ when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. Having believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
49Eph 1:14 who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God's possession--to the praise of his glory.
49Eph 1:15 For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
49Eph 1:16 I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.
49Eph 1:17 I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know him better.
49Eph 1:18 I pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,
49Eph 1:19 and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is like the working of his mighty strength,
49Eph 1:20 which he exerted in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms,
49Eph 1:21 far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
49Eph 1:22 And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church,
49Eph 1:23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in every way.
49Eph 2:1 As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,
49Eph 2:2 in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient.
49Eph 2:3 All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath.
49Eph 2:4 But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy,
49Eph 2:5 made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions--it is by grace you have been saved.
49Eph 2:6 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,
49Eph 2:7 in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
49Eph 2:8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God--
49Eph 2:9 not by works, so that no one can boast.
49Eph 2:10 For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.
49Eph 2:11 Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of men)--
49Eph 2:12 remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world.
49Eph 2:13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.
49Eph 2:14 For he himself is our peace, who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility,
49Eph 2:15 by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations. His purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two, thus making peace,
49Eph 2:16 and in this one body to reconcile both of them to God through the cross, by which he put to death their hostility.
49Eph 2:17 He came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near.
49Eph 2:18 For through him we both have access to the Father by one Spirit.
49Eph 2:19 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God's people and members of God's household,
49Eph 2:20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone.
49Eph 2:21 In him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
49Eph 2:22 And in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which God lives by his Spirit.
49Eph 3:1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--
49Eph 3:2 Surely you have heard about the administration of God's grace that was given to me for you,
49Eph 3:3 that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.
49Eph 3:4 In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,
49Eph 3:5 which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets.
49Eph 3:6 This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus.
49Eph 3:7 I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given me through the working of his power.
49Eph 3:8 Although I am less than the least of all God's people, this grace was given me£º to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
49Eph 3:9 and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.
49Eph 3:10 His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,
49Eph 3:11 according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.
49Eph 3:12 In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence.
49Eph 3:13 I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.
49Eph 3:14 For this reason I kneel before the Father,
49Eph 3:15 from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name.
49Eph 3:16 I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being,
49Eph 3:17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love,
49Eph 3:18 may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,
49Eph 3:19 and to know this love that surpasses knowledge--that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God.
49Eph 3:20 Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us,
49Eph 3:21 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.
49Eph 4:1 As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received.
49Eph 4:2 Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love.
49Eph 4:3 Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.
49Eph 4:4 There is one body and one Spirit--just as you were called to one hope when you were called--
49Eph 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism;
49Eph 4:6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
49Eph 4:7 But to each one of us grace has been given as Christ apportioned it.
49Eph 4:8 This is why it says£º "When he ascended on high, he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men."
49Eph 4:9 (What does "he ascended" mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?
49Eph 4:10 He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.)
49Eph 4:11 It was he who gave some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to be evangelists, and some to be pastors and teachers,
49Eph 4:12 to prepare God's people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up
49Eph 4:13 until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
49Eph 4:14 Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming.
49Eph 4:15 Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ.
49Eph 4:16 From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.
49Eph 4:17 So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.
49Eph 4:18 They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
49Eph 4:19 Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more.
49Eph 4:20 You, however, did not come to know Christ that way.
49Eph 4:21 Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in Jesus.
49Eph 4:22 You were taught, with regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
49Eph 4:23 to be made new in the attitude of your minds;
49Eph 4:24 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
49Eph 4:25 Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body.
49Eph 4:26 "In your anger do not sin"£º Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry,
49Eph 4:27 and do not give the devil a foothold.
49Eph 4:28 He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must work, doing something useful with his own hands, that he may have something to share with those in need.
49Eph 4:29 Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.
49Eph 4:30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
49Eph 4:31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.
49Eph 4:32 Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
49Eph 5:1 Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children
49Eph 5:2 and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
49Eph 5:3 But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people.
49Eph 5:4 Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.
49Eph 5:5 For of this you can be sure£º No immoral, impure or greedy person--such a man is an idolater--has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
49Eph 5:6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.
49Eph 5:7 Therefore do not be partners with them.
49Eph 5:8 For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light
49Eph 5:9 (for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)
49Eph 5:10 and find out what pleases the Lord.
49Eph 5:11 Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them.
49Eph 5:12 For it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.
49Eph 5:13 But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,
49Eph 5:14 for it is light that makes everything visible. This is why it is said£º "Wake up, O sleeper, rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
49Eph 5:15 Be very careful, then, how you live--not as unwise but as wise,
49Eph 5:16 making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
49Eph 5:17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.
49Eph 5:18 Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit.
49Eph 5:19 Speak to one another with psalms, hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord,
49Eph 5:20 always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 5:21 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
49Eph 5:22 Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
49Eph 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.
49Eph 5:24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.
49Eph 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
49Eph 5:26 to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,
49Eph 5:27 and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.
49Eph 5:28 In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
49Eph 5:29 After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church--
49Eph 5:30 for we are members of his body.
49Eph 5:31 "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
49Eph 5:32 This is a profound mystery--but I am talking about Christ and the church.
49Eph 5:33 However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
49Eph 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
49Eph 6:2 "Honor your father and mother"--which is the first commandment with a promise--
49Eph 6:3 "that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth."
49Eph 6:4 Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.
49Eph 6:5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.
49Eph 6:6 Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.
49Eph 6:7 Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men,
49Eph 6:8 because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free.
49Eph 6:9 And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.
49Eph 6:10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
49Eph 6:11 Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.
49Eph 6:12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
49Eph 6:13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
49Eph 6:14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,
49Eph 6:15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.
49Eph 6:16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
49Eph 6:17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
49Eph 6:18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.
49Eph 6:19 Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,
49Eph 6:20 for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.
49Eph 6:21 Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will tell you everything, so that you also may know how I am and what I am doing.
49Eph 6:22 I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you.
49Eph 6:23 Peace to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 6:24 Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.

50Php 1:1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons£º
50Php 1:2 Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
50Php 1:3 I thank my God every time I remember you.
50Php 1:4 In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy
50Php 1:5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,
50Php 1:6 being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
50Php 1:7 It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart; for whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.
50Php 1:8 God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.
50Php 1:9 And this is my prayer£º that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,
50Php 1:10 so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,
50Php 1:11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ--to the glory and praise of God.
50Php 1:12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.
50Php 1:13 As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.
50Php 1:14 Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.
50Php 1:15 It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.
50Php 1:16 The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
50Php 1:17 The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.
50Php 1:18 But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,
50Php 1:19 for I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.
50Php 1:20 I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
50Php 1:21 For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
50Php 1:22 If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!
50Php 1:23 I am torn between the two£º I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far;
50Php 1:24 but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.
50Php 1:25 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
50Php 1:26 so that through my being with you again your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.
50Php 1:27 Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending as one man for the faith of the gospel
50Php 1:28 without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved--and that by God.
50Php 1:29 For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him,
50Php 1:30 since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.
50Php 2:1 If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion,
50Php 2:2 then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose.
50Php 2:3 Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.
50Php 2:4 Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.
50Php 2:5 Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus£º
50Php 2:6 Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,
50Php 2:7 but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness.
50Php 2:8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient to death--even death on a cross!
50Php 2:9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name,
50Php 2:10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
50Php 2:11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
50Php 2:12 Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed--not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence--continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,
50Php 2:13 for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.
50Php 2:14 Do everything without complaining or arguing,
50Php 2:15 so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe
50Php 2:16 as you hold out the word of life--in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor for nothing.
50Php 2:17 But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.
50Php 2:18 So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.
50Php 2:19 I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you.
50Php 2:20 I have no one else like him, who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.
50Php 2:21 For everyone looks out for his own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
50Php 2:22 But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel.
50Php 2:23 I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me.
50Php 2:24 And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon.
50Php 2:25 But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs.
50Php 2:26 For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.
50Php 2:27 Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.
50Php 2:28 Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety.
50Php 2:29 Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him,
50Php 2:30 because he almost died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for the help you could not give me.
50Php 3:1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you.
50Php 3:2 Watch out for those dogs, those men who do evil, those mutilators of the flesh.
50Php 3:3 For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh--
50Php 3:4 though I myself have reasons for such confidence. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more£º
50Php 3:5 circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee;
50Php 3:6 as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for legalistic righteousness, faultless.
50Php 3:7 But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
50Php 3:8 What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ
50Php 3:9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ--the righteousness that comes from God and is by faith.
50Php 3:10 I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
50Php 3:11 and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.
50Php 3:12 Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.
50Php 3:13 Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do£º Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead,
50Php 3:14 I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.
50Php 3:15 All of us who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you.
50Php 3:16 Only let us live up to what we have already attained.
50Php 3:17 Join with others in following my example, brothers, and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you.
50Php 3:18 For, as I have often told you before and now say again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.
50Php 3:19 Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is on earthly things.
50Php 3:20 But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,
50Php 3:21 who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.
50Php 4:1 Therefore, my brothers, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, that is how you should stand firm in the Lord, dear friends!
50Php 4:2 I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to agree with each other in the Lord.
50Php 4:3 Yes, and I ask you, loyal yokefellow, help these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
50Php 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again£º Rejoice!
50Php 4:5 Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near.
50Php 4:6 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
50Php 4:7 And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things.
50Php 4:9 Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me--put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.
50Php 4:10 I rejoice greatly in the Lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you have been concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it.
50Php 4:11 I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances.
50Php 4:12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.
50Php 4:13 I can do everything through him who gives me strength.
50Php 4:14 Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles.
50Php 4:15 Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only;
50Php 4:16 for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid again and again when I was in need.
50Php 4:17 Not that I am looking for a gift, but I am looking for what may be credited to your account.
50Php 4:18 I have received full payment and even more; I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.
50Php 4:19 And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:20 To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
50Php 4:21 Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send greetings.
50Php 4:22 All the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar's household.
50Php 4:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
51
51Col 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
51Col 1:2 To the holy and faithful brothers in Christ at Colosse£º Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
51Col 1:3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
51Col 1:4 because we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints--
51Col 1:5 the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth, the gospel
51Col 1:6 that has come to you. All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God's grace in all its truth.
51Col 1:7 You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,
51Col 1:8 and who also told us of your love in the Spirit.
51Col 1:9 For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding.
51Col 1:10 And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way£º bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God,
51Col 1:11 being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully
51Col 1:12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.
51Col 1:13 For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,
51Col 1:14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
51Col 1:15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
51Col 1:16 For by him all things were created£º things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.
51Col 1:17 He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
51Col 1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.
51Col 1:19 For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,
51Col 1:20 and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.
51Col 1:21 Once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior.
51Col 1:22 But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation--
51Col 1:23 if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
51Col 1:24 Now I rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.
51Col 1:25 I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness--
51Col 1:26 the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the saints.
51Col 1:27 To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
51Col 1:28 We proclaim him, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone perfect in Christ.
51Col 1:29 To this end I labor, struggling with all his energy, which so powerfully works in me.
51Col 2:1 I want you to know how much I am struggling for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not met me personally.
51Col 2:2 My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ,
51Col 2:3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
51Col 2:4 I tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine-sounding arguments.
51Col 2:5 For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in Christ is.
51Col 2:6 So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him,
51Col 2:7 rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.
51Col 2:8 See to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy, which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on Christ.
51Col 2:9 For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form,
51Col 2:10 and you have been given fullness in Christ, who is the head over every power and authority.
51Col 2:11 In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ,
51Col 2:12 having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.
51Col 2:13 When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,
51Col 2:14 having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.
51Col 2:15 And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.
51Col 2:16 Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day.
51Col 2:17 These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.
51Col 2:18 Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions.
51Col 2:19 He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow.
51Col 2:20 Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules£º
51Col 2:21 "Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"?
51Col 2:22 These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings.
51Col 2:23 Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.
51Col 3:1 Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
51Col 3:2 Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
51Col 3:3 For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.
51Col 3:4 When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
51Col 3:5 Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature£º sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry.
51Col 3:6 Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
51Col 3:7 You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived.
51Col 3:8 But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these£º anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips.
51Col 3:9 Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices
51Col 3:10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.
51Col 3:11 Here there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all, and is in all.
51Col 3:12 Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
51Col 3:13 Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.
51Col 3:14 And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity.
51Col 3:15 Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.
51Col 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to God.
51Col 3:17 And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
51Col 3:18 Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
51Col 3:19 Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.
51Col 3:20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
51Col 3:21 Fathers, do not embitter your children, or they will become discouraged.
51Col 3:22 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.
51Col 3:23 Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men,
51Col 3:24 since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.
51Col 3:25 Anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong, and there is no favoritism.
51Col 4:1 Masters, provide your slaves with what is right and fair, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven.
51Col 4:2 Devote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful.
51Col 4:3 And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains.
51Col 4:4 Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should.
51Col 4:5 Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity.
51Col 4:6 Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.
51Col 4:7 Tychicus will tell you all the news about me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.
51Col 4:8 I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.
51Col 4:9 He is coming with Onesimus, our faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.
51Col 4:10 My fellow prisoner Aristarchus sends you his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. (You have received instructions about him; if he comes to you, welcome him.)
51Col 4:11 Jesus, who is called Justus, also sends greetings. These are the only Jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have proved a comfort to me.
51Col 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, that you may stand firm in all the will of God, mature and fully assured.
51Col 4:13 I vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at Laodicea and Hierapolis.
51Col 4:14 Our dear friend Luke, the doctor, and Demas send greetings.
51Col 4:15 Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
51Col 4:16 After this letter has been read to you, see that it is also read in the church of the Laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from Laodicea.
51Col 4:17 Tell Archippus£º "See to it that you complete the work you have received in the Lord."
51Col 4:18 I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
52
521Th 1:1 Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ£º Grace and peace to you.
521Th 1:2 We always thank God for all of you, mentioning you in our prayers.
521Th 1:3 We continually remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
521Th 1:4 For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you,
521Th 1:5 because our gospel came to you not simply with words, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction. You know how we lived among you for your sake.
521Th 1:6 You became imitators of us and of the Lord; in spite of severe suffering, you welcomed the message with the joy given by the Holy Spirit.
521Th 1:7 And so you became a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
521Th 1:8 The Lord's message rang out from you not only in Macedonia and Achaia--your faith in God has become known everywhere. Therefore we do not need to say anything about it,
521Th 1:9 for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
521Th 1:10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead--Jesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.
521Th 2:1 You know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a failure.
521Th 2:2 We had previously suffered and been insulted in Philippi, as you know, but with the help of our God we dared to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.
521Th 2:3 For the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives, nor are we trying to trick you.
521Th 2:4 On the contrary, we speak as men approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel. We are not trying to please men but God, who tests our hearts.
521Th 2:5 You know we never used flattery, nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed--God is our witness.
521Th 2:6 We were not looking for praise from men, not from you or anyone else. As apostles of Christ we could have been a burden to you,
521Th 2:7 but we were gentle among you, like a mother caring for her little children.
521Th 2:8 We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.
521Th 2:9 Surely you remember, brothers, our toil and hardship; we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of God to you.
521Th 2:10 You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed.
521Th 2:11 For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children,
521Th 2:12 encouraging, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.
521Th 2:13 And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it actually is, the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.
521Th 2:14 For you, brothers, became imitators of God's churches in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus£º You suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the Jews,
521Th 2:15 who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and also drove us out. They displease God and are hostile to all men
521Th 2:16 in their effort to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. In this way they always heap up their sins to the limit. The wrath of God has come upon them at last.
521Th 2:17 But, brothers, when we were torn away from you for a short time (in person, not in thought), out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you.
521Th 2:18 For we wanted to come to you--certainly I, Paul, did, again and again--but Satan stopped us.
521Th 2:19 For what is our hope, our joy, or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes? Is it not you?
521Th 2:20 Indeed, you are our glory and joy.
521Th 3:1 So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens.
521Th 3:2 We sent Timothy, who is our brother and God's fellow worker in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,
521Th 3:3 so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. You know quite well that we were destined for them.
521Th 3:4 In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know.
521Th 3:5 For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless.
521Th 3:6 But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love. He has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us, just as we also long to see you.
521Th 3:7 Therefore, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith.
521Th 3:8 For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord.
521Th 3:9 How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our God because of you?
521Th 3:10 Night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith.
521Th 3:11 Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus clear the way for us to come to you.
521Th 3:12 May the Lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else, just as ours does for you.
521Th 3:13 May he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
521Th 4:1 Finally, brothers, we instructed you how to live in order to please God, as in fact you are living. Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.
521Th 4:2 For you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
521Th 4:3 It is God's will that you should be sanctified£º that you should avoid sexual immorality;
521Th 4:4 that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable,
521Th 4:5 not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God;
521Th 4:6 and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him. The Lord will punish men for all such sins, as we have already told you and warned you.
521Th 4:7 For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.
521Th 4:8 Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.
521Th 4:9 Now about brotherly love we do not need to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love each other.
521Th 4:10 And in fact, you do love all the brothers throughout Macedonia. Yet we urge you, brothers, to do so more and more.
521Th 4:11 Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you,
521Th 4:12 so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.
521Th 4:13 Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no hope.
521Th 4:14 We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
521Th 4:15 According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.
521Th 4:16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
521Th 4:17 After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.
521Th 4:18 Therefore encourage each other with these words.
521Th 5:1 Now, brothers, about times and dates we do not need to write to you,
521Th 5:2 for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
521Th 5:3 While people are saying, "Peace and safety," destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
521Th 5:4 But you, brothers, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief.
521Th 5:5 You are all sons of the light and sons of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness.
521Th 5:6 So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be alert and self-controlled.
521Th 5:7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.
521Th 5:8 But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
521Th 5:9 For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
521Th 5:10 He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.
521Th 5:11 Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.
521Th 5:12 Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who work hard among you, who are over you in the Lord and who admonish you.
521Th 5:13 Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.
521Th 5:14 And we urge you, brothers, warn those who are idle, encourage the timid, help the weak, be patient with everyone.
521Th 5:15 Make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else.
521Th 5:16 Be joyful always;
521Th 5:17 pray continually;
521Th 5:18 give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.
521Th 5:19 Do not put out the Spirit's fire;
521Th 5:20 do not treat prophecies with contempt.
521Th 5:21 Test everything. Hold on to the good.
521Th 5:22 Avoid every kind of evil.
521Th 5:23 May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
521Th 5:24 The one who calls you is faithful and he will do it.
521Th 5:25 Brothers, pray for us.
521Th 5:26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
521Th 5:27 I charge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.
521Th 5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
53
532Th 1:1 Paul, Silas and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ£º
532Th 1:2 Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 1:3 We ought always to thank God for you, brothers, and rightly so, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing.
532Th 1:4 Therefore, among God's churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring.
532Th 1:5 All this is evidence that God's judgment is right, and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are suffering.
532Th 1:6 God is just£º He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you
532Th 1:7 and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels.
532Th 1:8 He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
532Th 1:9 They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power
532Th 1:10 on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed. This includes you, because you believed our testimony to you.
532Th 1:11 With this in mind, we constantly pray for you, that our God may count you worthy of his calling, and that by his power he may fulfill every good purpose of yours and every act prompted by your faith.
532Th 1:12 We pray this so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 2:1 Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers,
532Th 2:2 not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy, report or letter supposed to have come from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come.
532Th 2:3 Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction.
532Th 2:4 He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.
532Th 2:5 Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?
532Th 2:6 And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.
532Th 2:7 For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.
532Th 2:8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.
532Th 2:9 The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of Satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles, signs and wonders,
532Th 2:10 and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
532Th 2:11 For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie
532Th 2:12 and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.
532Th 2:13 But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers loved by the Lord, because from the beginning God chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.
532Th 2:14 He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 2:15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.
532Th 2:16 May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,
532Th 2:17 encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.
532Th 3:1 Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you.
532Th 3:2 And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith.
532Th 3:3 But the Lord is faithful, and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.
532Th 3:4 We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command.
532Th 3:5 May the Lord direct your hearts into God's love and Christ's perseverance.
532Th 3:6 In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.
532Th 3:7 For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,
532Th 3:8 nor did we eat anyone's food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.
532Th 3:9 We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow.
532Th 3:10 For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule£º "If a man will not work, he shall not eat."
532Th 3:11 We hear that some among you are idle. They are not busy; they are busybodies.
532Th 3:12 Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat.
532Th 3:13 And as for you, brothers, never tire of doing what is right.
532Th 3:14 If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of him. Do not associate with him, in order that he may feel ashamed.
532Th 3:15 Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
532Th 3:16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
532Th 3:17 I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand, which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters. This is how I write.
532Th 3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
54
541Tm 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,
541Tm 1:2 To Timothy my true son in the faith£º Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
541Tm 1:3 As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer
541Tm 1:4 nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. These promote controversies rather than God's work--which is by faith.
541Tm 1:5 The goal of this command is love, which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
541Tm 1:6 Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk.
541Tm 1:7 They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm.
541Tm 1:8 We know that the law is good if one uses it properly.
541Tm 1:9 We also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels, the ungodly and sinful, the unholy and irreligious; for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,
541Tm 1:10 for adulterers and perverts, for slave traders and liars and perjurers--and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine
541Tm 1:11 that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.
541Tm 1:12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me faithful, appointing me to his service.
541Tm 1:13 Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief.
541Tm 1:14 The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
541Tm 1:15 Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance£º Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the worst.
541Tm 1:16 But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life.
541Tm 1:17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
541Tm 1:18 Timothy, my son, I give you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies once made about you, so that by following them you may fight the good fight,
541Tm 1:19 holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith.
541Tm 1:20 Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.
541Tm 2:1 I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone--
541Tm 2:2 for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
541Tm 2:3 This is good, and pleases God our Savior,
541Tm 2:4 who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.
541Tm 2:5 For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
541Tm 2:6 who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time.
541Tm 2:7 And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle--I am telling the truth, I am not lying--and a teacher of the true faith to the Gentiles.
541Tm 2:8 I want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer, without anger or disputing.
541Tm 2:9 I also want women to dress modestly, with decency and propriety, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,
541Tm 2:10 but with good deeds, appropriate for women who profess to worship God.
541Tm 2:11 A woman should learn in quietness and full submission.
541Tm 2:12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.
541Tm 2:13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
541Tm 2:14 And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.
541Tm 2:15 But women will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.
541Tm 3:1 Here is a trustworthy saying£º If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer, he desires a noble task.
541Tm 3:2 Now the overseer must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
541Tm 3:3 not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.
541Tm 3:4 He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect.
541Tm 3:5 (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?)
541Tm 3:6 He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil.
541Tm 3:7 He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil's trap.
541Tm 3:8 Deacons, likewise, are to be men worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain.
541Tm 3:9 They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience.
541Tm 3:10 They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.
541Tm 3:11 In the same way, their wives are to be women worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.
541Tm 3:12 A deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children and his household well.
541Tm 3:13 Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.
541Tm 3:14 Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that,
541Tm 3:15 if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
541Tm 3:16 Beyond all question, the mystery of godliness is great£º He appeared in a body, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.
541Tm 4:1 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons.
541Tm 4:2 Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.
541Tm 4:3 They forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth.
541Tm 4:4 For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
541Tm 4:5 because it is consecrated by the word of God and prayer.
541Tm 4:6 If you point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed.
541Tm 4:7 Have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives' tales; rather, train yourself to be godly.
541Tm 4:8 For physical training is of some value, but godliness has value for all things, holding promise for both the present life and the life to come.
541Tm 4:9 This is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance
541Tm 4:10 (and for this we labor and strive), that we have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, and especially of those who believe.
541Tm 4:11 Command and teach these things.
541Tm 4:12 Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity.
541Tm 4:13 Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to teaching.
541Tm 4:14 Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you.
541Tm 4:15 Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress.
541Tm 4:16 Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
541Tm 5:1 Do not rebuke an older man harshly, but exhort him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers,
541Tm 5:2 older women as mothers, and younger women as sisters, with absolute purity.
541Tm 5:3 Give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need.
541Tm 5:4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God.
541Tm 5:5 The widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in God and continues night and day to pray and to ask God for help.
541Tm 5:6 But the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives.
541Tm 5:7 Give the people these instructions, too, so that no one may be open to blame.
541Tm 5:8 If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
541Tm 5:9 No widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty, has been faithful to her husband,
541Tm 5:10 and is well known for her good deeds, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the feet of the saints, helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds.
541Tm 5:11 As for younger widows, do not put them on such a list. For when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to Christ, they want to marry.
541Tm 5:12 Thus they bring judgment on themselves, because they have broken their first pledge.
541Tm 5:13 Besides, they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house. And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to.
541Tm 5:14 So I counsel younger widows to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander.
541Tm 5:15 Some have in fact already turned away to follow Satan.
541Tm 5:16 If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them, so that the church can help those widows who are really in need.
541Tm 5:17 The elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor, especially those whose work is preaching and teaching.
541Tm 5:18 For the Scripture says, "Do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain," and "The worker deserves his wages."
541Tm 5:19 Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses.
541Tm 5:20 Those who sin are to be rebuked publicly, so that the others may take warning.
541Tm 5:21 I charge you, in the sight of God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, and to do nothing out of favoritism.
541Tm 5:22 Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
541Tm 5:23 Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses.
541Tm 5:24 The sins of some men are obvious, reaching the place of judgment ahead of them; the sins of others trail behind them.
541Tm 5:25 In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden.
541Tm 6:1 All who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect, so that God's name and our teaching may not be slandered.
541Tm 6:2 Those who have believing masters are not to show less respect for them because they are brothers. Instead, they are to serve them even better, because those who benefit from their service are believers, and dear to them. These are the things you are to teach and urge on them.
541Tm 6:3 If anyone teaches false doctrines and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching,
541Tm 6:4 he is conceited and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions
541Tm 6:5 and constant friction between men of corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.
541Tm 6:6 But godliness with contentment is great gain.
541Tm 6:7 For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it.
541Tm 6:8 But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.
541Tm 6:9 People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.
541Tm 6:10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.
541Tm 6:11 But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.
541Tm 6:12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
541Tm 6:13 In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I charge you
541Tm 6:14 to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
541Tm 6:15 which God will bring about in his own time--God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
541Tm 6:16 who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen.
541Tm 6:17 Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
541Tm 6:18 Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share.
541Tm 6:19 In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.
541Tm 6:20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,
541Tm 6:21 which some have professed and in so doing have wandered from the faith. Grace be with you.

552Tm 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,
552Tm 1:2 To Timothy, my dear son£º Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
552Tm 1:3 I thank God, whom I serve, as my forefathers did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
552Tm 1:4 Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy.
552Tm 1:5 I have been reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also.
552Tm 1:6 For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.
552Tm 1:7 For God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but a spirit of power, of love and of self-discipline.
552Tm 1:8 So do not be ashamed to testify about our Lord, or ashamed of me his prisoner. But join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God,
552Tm 1:9 who has saved us and called us to a holy life--not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time,
552Tm 1:10 but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.
552Tm 1:11 And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher.
552Tm 1:12 That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet I am not ashamed, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him for that day.
552Tm 1:13 What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 1:14 Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you--guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
552Tm 1:15 You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
552Tm 1:16 May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains.
552Tm 1:17 On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me.
552Tm 1:18 May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.
552Tm 2:1 You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 2:2 And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others.
552Tm 2:3 Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
552Tm 2:4 No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs--he wants to please his commanding officer.
552Tm 2:5 Similarly, if anyone competes as an athlete, he does not receive the victor's crown unless he competes according to the rules.
552Tm 2:6 The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops.
552Tm 2:7 Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this.
552Tm 2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel,
552Tm 2:9 for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God's word is not chained.
552Tm 2:10 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.
552Tm 2:11 Here is a trustworthy saying£º If we died with him, we will also live with him;
552Tm 2:12 if we endure, we will also reign with him. If we disown him, he will also disown us;
552Tm 2:13 if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, for he cannot disown himself.
552Tm 2:14 Keep reminding them of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen.
552Tm 2:15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth.
552Tm 2:16 Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly.
552Tm 2:17 Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
552Tm 2:18 who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some.
552Tm 2:19 Nevertheless, God's solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription£º "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness."
552Tm 2:20 In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble.
552Tm 2:21 If a man cleanses himself from the latter, he will be an instrument for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.
552Tm 2:22 Flee the evil desires of youth, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
552Tm 2:23 Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels.
552Tm 2:24 And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful.
552Tm 2:25 Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth,
552Tm 2:26 and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.
552Tm 3:1 But mark this£º There will be terrible times in the last days.
552Tm 3:2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
552Tm 3:3 without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good,
552Tm 3:4 treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God--
552Tm 3:5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.
552Tm 3:6 They are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak-willed women, who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires,
552Tm 3:7 always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.
552Tm 3:8 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these men oppose the truth--men of depraved minds, who, as far as the faith is concerned, are rejected.
552Tm 3:9 But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those men, their folly will be clear to everyone.
552Tm 3:10 You, however, know all about my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, faith, patience, love, endurance,
552Tm 3:11 persecutions, sufferings--what kinds of things happened to me in Antioch, Iconium and Lystra, the persecutions I endured. Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
552Tm 3:12 In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,
552Tm 3:13 while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
552Tm 3:14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it,
552Tm 3:15 and how from infancy you have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 3:16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,
552Tm 3:17 so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
552Tm 4:1 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge£º
552Tm 4:2 Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.
552Tm 4:3 For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.
552Tm 4:4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.
552Tm 4:5 But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.
552Tm 4:6 For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come for my departure.
552Tm 4:7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
552Tm 4:8 Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day--and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing.
552Tm 4:9 Do your best to come to me quickly,
552Tm 4:10 for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
552Tm 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry.
552Tm 4:12 I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
552Tm 4:13 When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.
552Tm 4:14 Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done.
552Tm 4:15 You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message.
552Tm 4:16 At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them.
552Tm 4:17 But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion's mouth.
552Tm 4:18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
552Tm 4:19 Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.
552Tm 4:20 Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus.
552Tm 4:21 Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia and all the brothers.
552Tm 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
56
56Ti 1:1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness--
56Ti 1:2 a faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised before the beginning of time,
56Ti 1:3 and at his appointed season he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior,
56Ti 1:4 To Titus, my true son in our common faith£º Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
56Ti 1:5 The reason I left you in Crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.
56Ti 1:6 An elder must be blameless, the husband of but one wife, a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient.
56Ti 1:7 Since an overseer is entrusted with God's work, he must be blameless--not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain.
56Ti 1:8 Rather he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined.
56Ti 1:9 He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.
56Ti 1:10 For there are many rebellious people, mere talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group.
56Ti 1:11 They must be silenced, because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach--and that for the sake of dishonest gain.
56Ti 1:12 Even one of their own prophets has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons."
56Ti 1:13 This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith
56Ti 1:14 and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth.
56Ti 1:15 To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.
56Ti 1:16 They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.
56Ti 2:1 You must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine.
56Ti 2:2 Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and in endurance.
56Ti 2:3 Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good.
56Ti 2:4 Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children,
56Ti 2:5 to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to be kind, and to be subject to their husbands, so that no one will malign the word of God.
56Ti 2:6 Similarly, encourage the young men to be self-controlled.
56Ti 2:7 In everything set them an example by doing what is good. In your teaching show integrity, seriousness
56Ti 2:8 and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned, so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us.
56Ti 2:9 Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them,
56Ti 2:10 and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive.
56Ti 2:11 For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men.
56Ti 2:12 It teaches us to say "No" to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,
56Ti 2:13 while we wait for the blessed hope--the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
56Ti 2:14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.
56Ti 2:15 These, then, are the things you should teach. Encourage and rebuke with all authority. Do not let anyone despise you.
56Ti 3:1 Remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready to do whatever is good,
56Ti 3:2 to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and to show true humility toward all men.
56Ti 3:3 At one time we too were foolish, disobedient, deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures. We lived in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.
56Ti 3:4 But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,
56Ti 3:5 he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,
56Ti 3:6 whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior,
56Ti 3:7 so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.
56Ti 3:8 This is a trustworthy saying. And I want you to stress these things, so that those who have trusted in God may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good. These things are excellent and profitable for everyone.
56Ti 3:9 But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless.
56Ti 3:10 Warn a divisive person once, and then warn him a second time. After that, have nothing to do with him.
56Ti 3:11 You may be sure that such a man is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.
56Ti 3:12 As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there.
56Ti 3:13 Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need.
56Ti 3:14 Our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good, in order that they may provide for daily necessities and not live unproductive lives.
56Ti 3:15 Everyone with me sends you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.

57Phm 1:1 Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,
57Phm 1:2 to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home£º
57Phm 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
57Phm 1:4 I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers,
57Phm 1:5 because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.
57Phm 1:6 I pray that you may be active in sharing your faith, so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in Christ.
57Phm 1:7 Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.
57Phm 1:8 Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do,
57Phm 1:9 yet I appeal to you on the basis of love. I then, as Paul--an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus--
57Phm 1:10 I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who became my son while I was in chains.
57Phm 1:11 Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.
57Phm 1:12 I am sending him--who is my very heart--back to you.
57Phm 1:13 I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel.
57Phm 1:14 But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced.
57Phm 1:15 Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good--
57Phm 1:16 no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.
57Phm 1:17 So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
57Phm 1:18 If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me.
57Phm 1:19 I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back--not to mention that you owe me your very self.
57Phm 1:20 I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.
57Phm 1:21 Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.
57Phm 1:22 And one thing more£º Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers.
57Phm 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.
57Phm 1:24 And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers.
57Phm 1:25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

58Heb 1:1 In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,
58Heb 1:2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe.
58Heb 1:3 The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word. After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.
58Heb 1:4 So he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs.
58Heb 1:5 For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father"? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son"?
58Heb 1:6 And again, when God brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."
58Heb 1:7 In speaking of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, his servants flames of fire."
58Heb 1:8 But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom.
58Heb 1:9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy."
58Heb 1:10 He also says, "In the beginning, O Lord, you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
58Heb 1:11 They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment.
58Heb 1:12 You will roll them up like a robe; like a garment they will be changed. But you remain the same, and your years will never end."
58Heb 1:13 To which of the angels did God ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?
58Heb 1:14 Are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?
58Heb 2:1 We must pay more careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.
58Heb 2:2 For if the message spoken by angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment,
58Heb 2:3 how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.
58Heb 2:4 God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.
58Heb 2:5 It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.
58Heb 2:6 But there is a place where someone has testified£º "What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him?
58Heb 2:7 You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor
58Heb 2:8 and put everything under his feet." In putting everything under him, God left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present we do not see everything subject to him.
58Heb 2:9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
58Heb 2:10 In bringing many sons to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.
58Heb 2:11 Both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers.
58Heb 2:12 He says, "I will declare your name to my brothers; in the presence of the congregation I will sing your praises."
58Heb 2:13 And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again he says, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."
58Heb 2:14 Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death--that is, the devil--
58Heb 2:15 and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.
58Heb 2:16 For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants.
58Heb 2:17 For this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people.
58Heb 2:18 Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
58Heb 3:1 Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.
58Heb 3:2 He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all God's house.
58Heb 3:3 Jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.
58Heb 3:4 For every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.
58Heb 3:5 Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, testifying to what would be said in the future.
58Heb 3:6 But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.
58Heb 3:7 So, as the Holy Spirit says£º "Today, if you hear his voice,
58Heb 3:8 do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, during the time of testing in the desert,
58Heb 3:9 where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what I did.
58Heb 3:10 That is why I was angry with that generation, and I said, 'Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known my ways.'
58Heb 3:11 So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'"
58Heb 3:12 See to it, brothers, that none of you has a sinful, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.
58Heb 3:13 But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness.
58Heb 3:14 We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first.
58Heb 3:15 As has just been said£º "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion."
58Heb 3:16 Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?
58Heb 3:17 And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the desert?
58Heb 3:18 And to whom did God swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed?
58Heb 3:19 So we see that they were not able to enter, because of their unbelief.
58Heb 4:1 Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it.
58Heb 4:2 For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith.
58Heb 4:3 Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has said, "So I declared on oath in my anger, 'They shall never enter my rest.'" And yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world.
58Heb 4:4 For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words£º "And on the seventh day God rested from all his work."
58Heb 4:5 And again in the passage above he says, "They shall never enter my rest."
58Heb 4:6 It still remains that some will enter that rest, and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in, because of their disobedience.
58Heb 4:7 Therefore God again set a certain day, calling it Today, when a long time later he spoke through David, as was said before£º "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
58Heb 4:8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.
58Heb 4:9 There remains, then, a Sabbath-rest for the people of God;
58Heb 4:10 for anyone who enters God's rest also rests from his own work, just as God did from his.
58Heb 4:11 Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.
58Heb 4:12 For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.
58Heb 4:13 Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
58Heb 4:14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
58Heb 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are--yet was without sin.
58Heb 4:16 Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
58Heb 5:1 Every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
58Heb 5:2 He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness.
58Heb 5:3 This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.
58Heb 5:4 No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was.
58Heb 5:5 So Christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest. But God said to him, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father."
58Heb 5:6 And he says in another place, "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
58Heb 5:7 During the days of Jesus' life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission.
58Heb 5:8 Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered
58Heb 5:9 and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him
58Heb 5:10 and was designated by God to be high priest in the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 5:11 We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn.
58Heb 5:12 In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!
58Heb 5:13 Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.
58Heb 5:14 But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
58Heb 6:1 Therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God,
58Heb 6:2 instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58Heb 6:3 And God permitting, we will do so.
58Heb 6:4 It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit,
58Heb 6:5 who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age,
58Heb 6:6 if they fall away, to be brought back to repentance, because to their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace.
58Heb 6:7 Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God.
58Heb 6:8 But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned.
58Heb 6:9 Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are confident of better things in your case--things that accompany salvation.
58Heb 6:10 God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.
58Heb 6:11 We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to make your hope sure.
58Heb 6:12 We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised.
58Heb 6:13 When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself,
58Heb 6:14 saying, "I will surely bless you and give you many descendants."
58Heb 6:15 And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised.
58Heb 6:16 Men swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument.
58Heb 6:17 Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath.
58Heb 6:18 God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged.
58Heb 6:19 We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain,
58Heb 6:20 where Jesus, who went before us, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 7:1 This Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of God Most High. He met Abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him,
58Heb 7:2 and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means "king of righteousness"; then also, "king of Salem" means "king of peace."
58Heb 7:3 Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he remains a priest forever.
58Heb 7:4 Just think how great he was£º Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder!
58Heb 7:5 Now the law requires the descendants of Levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people--that is, their brothers--even though their brothers are descended from Abraham.
58Heb 7:6 This man, however, did not trace his descent from Levi, yet he collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
58Heb 7:7 And without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater.
58Heb 7:8 In the one case, the tenth is collected by men who die; but in the other case, by him who is declared to be living.
58Heb 7:9 One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,
58Heb 7:10 because when Melchizedek met Abraham, Levi was still in the body of his ancestor.
58Heb 7:11 If perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the law was given to the people), why was there still need for another priest to come--one in the order of Melchizedek, not in the order of Aaron?
58Heb 7:12 For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must also be a change of the law.
58Heb 7:13 He of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.
58Heb 7:14 For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah, and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
58Heb 7:15 And what we have said is even more clear if another priest like Melchizedek appears,
58Heb 7:16 one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.
58Heb 7:17 For it is declared£º "You are a priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek."
58Heb 7:18 The former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless
58Heb 7:19 (for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God.
58Heb 7:20 And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath,
58Heb 7:21 but he became a priest with an oath when God said to him£º "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind£º 'You are a priest forever.'"
58Heb 7:22 Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.
58Heb 7:23 Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;
58Heb 7:24 but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.
58Heb 7:25 Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.
58Heb 7:26 Such a high priest meets our need--one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.
58Heb 7:27 Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself.
58Heb 7:28 For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.
58Heb 8:1 The point of what we are saying is this£º We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
58Heb 8:2 and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man.
58Heb 8:3 Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer.
58Heb 8:4 If he were on earth, he would not be a priest, for there are already men who offer the gifts prescribed by the law.
58Heb 8:5 They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle£º "See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain."
58Heb 8:6 But the ministry Jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one, and it is founded on better promises.
58Heb 8:7 For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.
58Heb 8:8 But God found fault with the people and said£º "The time is coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.
58Heb 8:9 It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord.
58Heb 8:10 This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
58Heb 8:11 No longer will a man teach his neighbor, or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.
58Heb 8:12 For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more."
58Heb 8:13 By calling this covenant "new," he has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.
58Heb 9:1 Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.
58Heb 9:2 A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand, the table and the consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place.
58Heb 9:3 Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place,
58Heb 9:4 which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.
58Heb 9:5 Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now.
58Heb 9:6 When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.
58Heb 9:7 But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
58Heb 9:8 The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing.
58Heb 9:9 This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.
58Heb 9:10 They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings--external regulations applying until the time of the new order.
58Heb 9:11 When Christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man-made, that is to say, not a part of this creation.
58Heb 9:12 He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but he entered the Most Holy Place once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.
58Heb 9:13 The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean.
58Heb 9:14 How much more, then, will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!
58Heb 9:15 For this reason Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance--now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.
58Heb 9:16 In the case of a will, it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it,
58Heb 9:17 because a will is in force only when somebody has died; it never takes effect while the one who made it is living.
58Heb 9:18 This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
58Heb 9:19 When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves, together with water, scarlet wool and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.
58Heb 9:20 He said, "This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep."
58Heb 9:21 In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies.
58Heb 9:22 In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
58Heb 9:23 It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
58Heb 9:24 For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God's presence.
58Heb 9:25 Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.
58Heb 9:26 Then Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.
58Heb 9:27 Just as man is destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,
58Heb 9:28 so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.
58Heb 10:1 The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming--not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.
58Heb 10:2 If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins.
58Heb 10:3 But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins,
58Heb 10:4 because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
58Heb 10:5 Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said£º "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me;
58Heb 10:6 with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased.
58Heb 10:7 Then I said, 'Here I am--it is written about me in the scroll--I have come to do your will, O God.'"
58Heb 10:8 First he said, "Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them" (although the law required them to be made).
58Heb 10:9 Then he said, "Here I am, I have come to do your will." He sets aside the first to establish the second.
58Heb 10:10 And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
58Heb 10:11 Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
58Heb 10:12 But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God.
58Heb 10:13 Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool,
58Heb 10:14 because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy.
58Heb 10:15 The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says£º
58Heb 10:16 "This is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds."
58Heb 10:17 Then he adds£º "Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more."
58Heb 10:18 And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin.
58Heb 10:19 Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,
58Heb 10:20 by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body,
58Heb 10:21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
58Heb 10:22 let us draw near to God with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water.
58Heb 10:23 Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful.
58Heb 10:24 And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds.
58Heb 10:25 Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another--and all the more as you see the Day approaching.
58Heb 10:26 If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
58Heb 10:27 but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
58Heb 10:28 Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
58Heb 10:29 How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?
58Heb 10:30 For we know him who said, "It is mine to avenge; I will repay," and again, "The Lord will judge his people."
58Heb 10:31 It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
58Heb 10:32 Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering.
58Heb 10:33 Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.
58Heb 10:34 You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions.
58Heb 10:35 So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded.
58Heb 10:36 You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised.
58Heb 10:37 For in just a very little while, "He who is coming will come and will not delay.
58Heb 10:38 But my righteous one will live by faith. And if he shrinks back, I will not be pleased with him."
58Heb 10:39 But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who believe and are saved.
58Heb 11:1 Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.
58Heb 11:2 This is what the ancients were commended for.
58Heb 11:3 By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible.
58Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.
58Heb 11:5 By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.
58Heb 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.
58Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
58Heb 11:8 By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.
58Heb 11:9 By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; he lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.
58Heb 11:10 For he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
58Heb 11:11 By faith Abraham, even though he was past age--and Sarah herself was barren--was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise.
58Heb 11:12 And so from this one man, and he as good as dead, came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.
58Heb 11:13 All these people were still living by faith when they died. They did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance. And they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth.
58Heb 11:14 People who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own.
58Heb 11:15 If they had been thinking of the country they had left, they would have had opportunity to return.
58Heb 11:16 Instead, they were longing for a better country--a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
58Heb 11:17 By faith Abraham, when God tested him, offered Isaac as a sacrifice. He who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son,
58Heb 11:18 even though God had said to him, "It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned."
58Heb 11:19 Abraham reasoned that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did receive Isaac back from death.
58Heb 11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.
58Heb 11:21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
58Heb 11:22 By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions about his bones.
58Heb 11:23 By faith Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born, because they saw he was no ordinary child, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
58Heb 11:24 By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
58Heb 11:25 He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time.
58Heb 11:26 He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.
58Heb 11:27 By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible.
58Heb 11:28 By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of Israel.
58Heb 11:29 By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.
58Heb 11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell, after the people had marched around them for seven days.
58Heb 11:31 By faith the prostitute Rahab, because she welcomed the spies, was not killed with those who were disobedient.
58Heb 11:32 And what more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel and the prophets,
58Heb 11:33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised; who shut the mouths of lions,
58Heb 11:34 quenched the fury of the flames, and escaped the edge of the sword; whose weakness was turned to strength; and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies.
58Heb 11:35 Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection.
58Heb 11:36 Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison.
58Heb 11:37 They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated--
58Heb 11:38 the world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.
58Heb 11:39 These were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised.
58Heb 11:40 God had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.
58Heb 12:1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.
58Heb 12:2 Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
58Heb 12:3 Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
58Heb 12:4 In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
58Heb 12:5 And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons£º "My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline, and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,
58Heb 12:6 because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son."
58Heb 12:7 Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father?
58Heb 12:8 If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons.
58Heb 12:9 Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live!
58Heb 12:10 Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.
58Heb 12:11 No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.
58Heb 12:12 Therefore, strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees.
58Heb 12:13 "Make level paths for your feet," so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.
58Heb 12:14 Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.
58Heb 12:15 See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.
58Heb 12:16 See that no one is sexually immoral, or is godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son.
58Heb 12:17 Afterward, as you know, when he wanted to inherit this blessing, he was rejected. He could bring about no change of mind, though he sought the blessing with tears.
58Heb 12:18 You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire; to darkness, gloom and storm;
58Heb 12:19 to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them,
58Heb 12:20 because they could not bear what was commanded£º "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned."
58Heb 12:21 The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling with fear."
58Heb 12:22 But you have come to Mount Zion, to the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly,
58Heb 12:23 to the church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the judge of all men, to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,
58Heb 12:24 to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
58Heb 12:25 See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. If they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?
58Heb 12:26 At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, "Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens."
58Heb 12:27 The words "once more" indicate the removing of what can be shaken--that is, created things--so that what cannot be shaken may remain.
58Heb 12:28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,
58Heb 12:29 for our "God is a consuming fire."
58Heb 13:1 Keep on loving each other as brothers.
58Heb 13:2 Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.
58Heb 13:3 Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.
58Heb 13:4 Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.
58Heb 13:5 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, "Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you."
58Heb 13:6 So we say with confidence, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?"
58Heb 13:7 Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.
58Heb 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
58Heb 13:9 Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by ceremonial foods, which are of no value to those who eat them.
58Heb 13:10 We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat.
58Heb 13:11 The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp.
58Heb 13:12 And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood.
58Heb 13:13 Let us, then, go to him outside the camp, bearing the disgrace he bore.
58Heb 13:14 For here we do not have an enduring city, but we are looking for the city that is to come.
58Heb 13:15 Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise--the fruit of lips that confess his name.
58Heb 13:16 And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.
58Heb 13:17 Obey your leaders and submit to their authority. They keep watch over you as men who must give an account. Obey them so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no advantage to you.
58Heb 13:18 Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.
58Heb 13:19 I particularly urge you to pray so that I may be restored to you soon.
58Heb 13:20 May the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
58Heb 13:21 equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
58Heb 13:22 Brothers, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written you only a short letter.
58Heb 13:23 I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you.
58Heb 13:24 Greet all your leaders and all God's people. Those from Italy send you their greetings.
58Heb 13:25 Grace be with you all.
59
59Jms 1:1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations£º Greetings.
59Jms 1:2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds,
59Jms 1:3 because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
59Jms 1:4 Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.
59Jms 1:5 If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to him.
59Jms 1:6 But when he asks, he must believe and not doubt, because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.
59Jms 1:7 That man should not think he will receive anything from the Lord;
59Jms 1:8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all he does.
59Jms 1:9 The brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position.
59Jms 1:10 But the one who is rich should take pride in his low position, because he will pass away like a wild flower.
59Jms 1:11 For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business.
59Jms 1:12 Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, because when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.
59Jms 1:13 When tempted, no one should say, "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;
59Jms 1:14 but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed.
59Jms 1:15 Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.
59Jms 1:16 Don't be deceived, my dear brothers.
59Jms 1:17 Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
59Jms 1:18 He chose to give us birth through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.
59Jms 1:19 My dear brothers, take note of this£º Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,
59Jms 1:20 for man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.
59Jms 1:21 Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you.
59Jms 1:22 Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.
59Jms 1:23 Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror
59Jms 1:24 and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.
59Jms 1:25 But the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues to do this, not forgetting what he has heard, but doing it--he will be blessed in what he does.
59Jms 1:26 If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue, he deceives himself and his religion is worthless.
59Jms 1:27 Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this£º to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.
59Jms 2:1 My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism.
59Jms 2:2 Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.
59Jms 2:3 If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet,"
59Jms 2:4 have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
59Jms 2:5 Listen, my dear brothers£º Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?
59Jms 2:6 But you have insulted the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?
59Jms 2:7 Are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong?
59Jms 2:8 If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, "Love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing right.
59Jms 2:9 But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
59Jms 2:10 For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
59Jms 2:11 For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
59Jms 2:12 Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom,
59Jms 2:13 because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment!
59Jms 2:14 What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?
59Jms 2:15 Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.
59Jms 2:16 If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it?
59Jms 2:17 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
59Jms 2:18 But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.
59Jms 2:19 You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--and shudder.
59Jms 2:20 You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?
59Jms 2:21 Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
59Jms 2:22 You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did.
59Jms 2:23 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness," and he was called God's friend.
59Jms 2:24 You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.
59Jms 2:25 In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?
59Jms 2:26 As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
59Jms 3:1 Not many of you should presume to be teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
59Jms 3:2 We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to keep his whole body in check.
59Jms 3:3 When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal.
59Jms 3:4 Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.
59Jms 3:5 Likewise the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
59Jms 3:6 The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole person, sets the whole course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.
59Jms 3:7 All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man,
59Jms 3:8 but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
59Jms 3:9 With the tongue we praise our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God's likeness.
59Jms 3:10 Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing. My brothers, this should not be.
59Jms 3:11 Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
59Jms 3:12 My brothers, can a fig tree bear olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
59Jms 3:13 Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.
59Jms 3:14 But if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.
59Jms 3:15 Such "wisdom" does not come down from heaven but is earthly, unspiritual, of the devil.
59Jms 3:16 For where you have envy and selfish ambition, there you find disorder and every evil practice.
59Jms 3:17 But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere.
59Jms 3:18 Peacemakers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness.
59Jms 4:1 What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you?
59Jms 4:2 You want something but don't get it. You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God.
59Jms 4:3 When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures.
59Jms 4:4 You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.
59Jms 4:5 Or do you think Scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely?
59Jms 4:6 But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says£º "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."
59Jms 4:7 Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
59Jms 4:8 Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
59Jms 4:9 Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom.
59Jms 4:10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.
59Jms 4:11 Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. When you judge the law, you are not keeping it, but sitting in judgment on it.
59Jms 4:12 There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But you--who are you to judge your neighbor?
59Jms 4:13 Now listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money."
59Jms 4:14 Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
59Jms 4:15 Instead, you ought to say, "If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that."
59Jms 4:16 As it is, you boast and brag. All such boasting is evil.
59Jms 4:17 Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins.
59Jms 5:1 Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming upon you.
59Jms 5:2 Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes.
59Jms 5:3 Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days.
59Jms 5:4 Look! The wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.
59Jms 5:5 You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
59Jms 5:6 You have condemned and murdered innocent men, who were not opposing you.
59Jms 5:7 Be patient, then, brothers, until the Lord's coming. See how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains.
59Jms 5:8 You too, be patient and stand firm, because the Lord's coming is near.
59Jms 5:9 Don't grumble against each other, brothers, or you will be judged. The Judge is standing at the door!
59Jms 5:10 Brothers, as an example of patience in the face of suffering, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:11 As you know, we consider blessed those who have persevered. You have heard of Job's perseverance and have seen what the Lord finally brought about. The Lord is full of compassion and mercy.
59Jms 5:12 Above all, my brothers, do not swear--not by heaven or by earth or by anything else. Let your "Yes" be yes, and your "No," no, or you will be condemned.
59Jms 5:13 Is any one of you in trouble? He should pray. Is anyone happy? Let him sing songs of praise.
59Jms 5:14 Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:15 And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.
59Jms 5:16 Therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
59Jms 5:17 Elijah was a man just like us. He prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years.
59Jms 5:18 Again he prayed, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.
59Jms 5:19 My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back,
59Jms 5:20 remember this£º Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins.

601Pt 1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia,
601Pt 1:2 who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood£º Grace and peace be yours in abundance.
601Pt 1:3 Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
601Pt 1:4 and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade--kept in heaven for you,
601Pt 1:5 who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
601Pt 1:6 In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
601Pt 1:7 These have come so that your faith--of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire--may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
601Pt 1:8 Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy,
601Pt 1:9 for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
601Pt 1:10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care,
601Pt 1:11 trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.
601Pt 1:12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.
601Pt 1:13 Therefore, prepare your minds for action; be self-controlled; set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.
601Pt 1:14 As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.
601Pt 1:15 But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;
601Pt 1:16 for it is written£º "Be holy, because I am holy."
601Pt 1:17 Since you call on a Father who judges each man's work impartially, live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear.
601Pt 1:18 For you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers,
601Pt 1:19 but with the precious blood of Christ, a lamb without blemish or defect.
601Pt 1:20 He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.
601Pt 1:21 Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and glorified him, and so your faith and hope are in God.
601Pt 1:22 Now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers, love one another deeply, from the heart.
601Pt 1:23 For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.
601Pt 1:24 For, "All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall,
601Pt 1:25 but the word of the Lord stands forever." And this is the word that was preached to you.
601Pt 2:1 Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind.
601Pt 2:2 Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,
601Pt 2:3 now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.
601Pt 2:4 As you come to him, the living Stone--rejected by men but chosen by God and precious to him--
601Pt 2:5 you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
601Pt 2:6 For in Scripture it says£º "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and precious cornerstone, and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame."
601Pt 2:7 Now to you who believe, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, "The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone,"
601Pt 2:8 and, "A stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall." They stumble because they disobey the message--which is also what they were destined for.
601Pt 2:9 But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
601Pt 2:10 Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
601Pt 2:11 Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul.
601Pt 2:12 Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.
601Pt 2:13 Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every authority instituted among men£º whether to the king, as the supreme authority,
601Pt 2:14 or to governors, who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right.
601Pt 2:15 For it is God's will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.
601Pt 2:16 Live as free men, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.
601Pt 2:17 Show proper respect to everyone£º Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.
601Pt 2:18 Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh.
601Pt 2:19 For it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God.
601Pt 2:20 But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.
601Pt 2:21 To this you were called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.
601Pt 2:22 "He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth."
601Pt 2:23 When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats. Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
601Pt 2:24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.
601Pt 2:25 For you were like sheep going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
601Pt 3:1 Wives, in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives,
601Pt 3:2 when they see the purity and reverence of your lives.
601Pt 3:3 Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes.
601Pt 3:4 Instead, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight.
601Pt 3:5 For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to make themselves beautiful. They were submissive to their own husbands,
601Pt 3:6 like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her master. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear.
601Pt 3:7 Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.
601Pt 3:8 Finally, all of you, live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble.
601Pt 3:9 Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.
601Pt 3:10 For, "Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech.
601Pt 3:11 He must turn from evil and do good; he must seek peace and pursue it.
601Pt 3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
601Pt 3:13 Who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good?
601Pt 3:14 But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. "Do not fear what they fear; do not be frightened."
601Pt 3:15 But in your hearts set apart Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,
601Pt 3:16 keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.
601Pt 3:17 It is better, if it is God's will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
601Pt 3:18 For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit,
601Pt 3:19 through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison
601Pt 3:20 who disobeyed long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water,
601Pt 3:21 and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also--not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
601Pt 3:22 who has gone into heaven and is at God's right hand--with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him.
601Pt 4:1 Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin.
601Pt 4:2 As a result, he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.
601Pt 4:3 For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do--living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.
601Pt 4:4 They think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you.
601Pt 4:5 But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
601Pt 4:6 For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.
601Pt 4:7 The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray.
601Pt 4:8 Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.
601Pt 4:9 Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.
601Pt 4:10 Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace in its various forms.
601Pt 4:11 If anyone speaks, he should do it as one speaking the very words of God. If anyone serves, he should do it with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.
601Pt 4:12 Dear friends, do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering, as though something strange were happening to you.
601Pt 4:13 But rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
601Pt 4:14 If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.
601Pt 4:15 If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal, or even as a meddler.
601Pt 4:16 However, if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but praise God that you bear that name.
601Pt 4:17 For it is time for judgment to begin with the family of God; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
601Pt 4:18 And, "If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?"
601Pt 4:19 So then, those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful Creator and continue to do good.
601Pt 5:1 To the elders among you, I appeal as a fellow elder, a witness of Christ's sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed£º
601Pt 5:2 Be shepherds of God's flock that is under your care, serving as overseers--not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not greedy for money, but eager to serve;
601Pt 5:3 not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.
601Pt 5:4 And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away.
601Pt 5:5 Young men, in the same way be submissive to those who are older. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."
601Pt 5:6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time.
601Pt 5:7 Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.
601Pt 5:8 Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
601Pt 5:9 Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings.
601Pt 5:10 And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast.
601Pt 5:11 To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.
601Pt 5:12 With the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.
601Pt 5:13 She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark.
601Pt 5:14 Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
61
612Pt 1:1 Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ have received a faith as precious as ours£º
612Pt 1:2 Grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
612Pt 1:3 His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness.
612Pt 1:4 Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires.
612Pt 1:5 For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge;
612Pt 1:6 and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to perseverance, godliness;
612Pt 1:7 and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love.
612Pt 1:8 For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
612Pt 1:9 But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins.
612Pt 1:10 Therefore, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure. For if you do these things, you will never fall,
612Pt 1:11 and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
612Pt 1:12 So I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.
612Pt 1:13 I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I live in the tent of this body,
612Pt 1:14 because I know that I will soon put it aside, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.
612Pt 1:15 And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things.
612Pt 1:16 We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
612Pt 1:17 For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."
612Pt 1:18 We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain.
612Pt 1:19 And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
612Pt 1:20 Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation.
612Pt 1:21 For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
612Pt 2:1 But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them--bringing swift destruction on themselves.
612Pt 2:2 Many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute.
612Pt 2:3 In their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.
612Pt 2:4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment;
612Pt 2:5 if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others;
612Pt 2:6 if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;
612Pt 2:7 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men
612Pt 2:8 (for that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)--
612Pt 2:9 if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment.
612Pt 2:10 This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings;
612Pt 2:11 yet even angels, although they are stronger and more powerful, do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings in the presence of the Lord.
612Pt 2:12 But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like beasts they too will perish.
612Pt 2:13 They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you.
612Pt 2:14 With eyes full of adultery, they never stop sinning; they seduce the unstable; they are experts in greed--an accursed brood!
612Pt 2:15 They have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam son of Beor, who loved the wages of wickedness.
612Pt 2:16 But he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey--a beast without speech--who spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
612Pt 2:17 These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
612Pt 2:18 For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful human nature, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error.
612Pt 2:19 They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity--for a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him.
612Pt 2:20 If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.
612Pt 2:21 It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.
612Pt 2:22 Of them the proverbs are true£º "A dog returns to its vomit," and, "A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud."
612Pt 3:1 Dear friends, this is now my second letter to you. I have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking.
612Pt 3:2 I want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our Lord and Savior through your apostles.
612Pt 3:3 First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires.
612Pt 3:4 They will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation."
612Pt 3:5 But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water.
612Pt 3:6 By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed.
612Pt 3:7 By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.
612Pt 3:8 But do not forget this one thing, dear friends£º With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.
612Pt 3:9 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. He is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
612Pt 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare.
612Pt 3:11 Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives
612Pt 3:12 as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.
612Pt 3:13 But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home of righteousness.
612Pt 3:14 So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.
612Pt 3:15 Bear in mind that our Lord's patience means salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote you with the wisdom that God gave him.
612Pt 3:16 He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.
612Pt 3:17 Therefore, dear friends, since you already know this, be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position.
612Pt 3:18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever! Amen.

621Jn 1:1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched--this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.
621Jn 1:2 The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and has appeared to us.
621Jn 1:3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
621Jn 1:4 We write this to make our joy complete.
621Jn 1:5 This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you£º God is light; in him there is no darkness at all.
621Jn 1:6 If we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not live by the truth.
621Jn 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.
621Jn 1:8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.
621Jn 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
621Jn 1:10 If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives.
621Jn 2:1 My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.
621Jn 2:2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.
621Jn 2:3 We know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands.
621Jn 2:4 The man who says, "I know him," but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
621Jn 2:5 But if anyone obeys his word, God's love is truly made complete in him. This is how we know we are in him£º
621Jn 2:6 Whoever claims to live in him must walk as Jesus did.
621Jn 2:7 Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command but an old one, which you have had since the beginning. This old command is the message you have heard.
621Jn 2:8 Yet I am writing you a new command; its truth is seen in him and you, because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining.
621Jn 2:9 Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness.
621Jn 2:10 Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble.
621Jn 2:11 But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness; he does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded him.
621Jn 2:12 I write to you, dear children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
621Jn 2:13 I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, dear children, because you have known the Father.
621Jn 2:14 I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God lives in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
621Jn 2:15 Do not love the world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
621Jn 2:16 For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does--comes not from the Father but from the world.
621Jn 2:17 The world and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever.
621Jn 2:18 Dear children, this is the last hour; and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come. This is how we know it is the last hour.
621Jn 2:19 They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.
621Jn 2:20 But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you know the truth.
621Jn 2:21 I do not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth.
621Jn 2:22 Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist--he denies the Father and the Son.
621Jn 2:23 No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
621Jn 2:24 See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.
621Jn 2:25 And this is what he promised us--even eternal life.
621Jn 2:26 I am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray.
621Jn 2:27 As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real, not counterfeit--just as it has taught you, remain in him.
621Jn 2:28 And now, dear children, continue in him, so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming.
621Jn 2:29 If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him.
621Jn 3:1 How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! The reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
621Jn 3:2 Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.
621Jn 3:3 Everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.
621Jn 3:4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.
621Jn 3:5 But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins. And in him is no sin.
621Jn 3:6 No one who lives in him keeps on sinning. No one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him.
621Jn 3:7 Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.
621Jn 3:8 He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work.
621Jn 3:9 No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.
621Jn 3:10 This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are£º Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother.
621Jn 3:11 This is the message you heard from the beginning£º We should love one another.
621Jn 3:12 Do not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own actions were evil and his brother's were righteous.
621Jn 3:13 Do not be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you.
621Jn 3:14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death.
621Jn 3:15 Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.
621Jn 3:16 This is how we know what love is£º Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.
621Jn 3:17 If anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?
621Jn 3:18 Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.
621Jn 3:19 This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence
621Jn 3:20 whenever our hearts condemn us. For God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.
621Jn 3:21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God
621Jn 3:22 and receive from him anything we ask, because we obey his commands and do what pleases him.
621Jn 3:23 And this is his command£º to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us.
621Jn 3:24 Those who obey his commands live in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us£º We know it by the Spirit he gave us.
621Jn 4:1 Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
621Jn 4:2 This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God£º Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
621Jn 4:3 but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.
621Jn 4:4 You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
621Jn 4:5 They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them.
621Jn 4:6 We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. This is how we recognize the Spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood.
621Jn 4:7 Dear friends, let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
621Jn 4:8 Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love.
621Jn 4:9 This is how God showed his love among us£º He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him.
621Jn 4:10 This is love£º not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
621Jn 4:11 Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
621Jn 4:12 No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.
621Jn 4:13 We know that we live in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
621Jn 4:14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.
621Jn 4:15 If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him and he in God.
621Jn 4:16 And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him.
621Jn 4:17 In this way, love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment, because in this world we are like him.
621Jn 4:18 There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love.
621Jn 4:19 We love because he first loved us.
621Jn 4:20 If anyone says, "I love God," yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.
621Jn 4:21 And he has given us this command£º Whoever loves God must also love his brother.
621Jn 5:1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well.
621Jn 5:2 This is how we know that we love the children of God£º by loving God and carrying out his commands.
621Jn 5:3 This is love for God£º to obey his commands. And his commands are not burdensome,
621Jn 5:4 for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith.
621Jn 5:5 Who is it that overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
621Jn 5:6 This is the one who came by water and blood--Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
621Jn 5:7 For there are three that testify£º
621Jn 5:8 the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.
621Jn 5:9 We accept man's testimony, but God's testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son.
621Jn 5:10 Anyone who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in his heart. Anyone who does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because he has not believed the testimony God has given about his Son.
621Jn 5:11 And this is the testimony£º God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
621Jn 5:12 He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
621Jn 5:13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.
621Jn 5:14 This is the confidence we have in approaching God£º that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.
621Jn 5:15 And if we know that he hears us--whatever we ask--we know that we have what we asked of him.
621Jn 5:16 If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray and God will give him life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that he should pray about that.
621Jn 5:17 All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.
621Jn 5:18 We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the one who was born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot harm him.
621Jn 5:19 We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one.
621Jn 5:20 We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true--even in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
621Jn 5:21 Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.
63
632Jn 1:1 The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth--and not I only, but also all who know the truth--
632Jn 1:2 because of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever£º
632Jn 1:3 Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Father's Son, will be with us in truth and love.
632Jn 1:4 It has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father commanded us.
632Jn 1:5 And now, dear lady, I am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning. I ask that we love one another.
632Jn 1:6 And this is love£º that we walk in obedience to his commands. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is that you walk in love.
632Jn 1:7 Many deceivers, who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh, have gone out into the world. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.
632Jn 1:8 Watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.
632Jn 1:9 Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
632Jn 1:10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take him into your house or welcome him.
632Jn 1:11 Anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work.
632Jn 1:12 I have much to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
632Jn 1:13 The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.
64
643Jn 1:1 The elder, To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
643Jn 1:2 Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.
643Jn 1:3 It gave me great joy to have some brothers come and tell about your faithfulness to the truth and how you continue to walk in the truth.
643Jn 1:4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
643Jn 1:5 Dear friend, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers, even though they are strangers to you.
643Jn 1:6 They have told the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
643Jn 1:7 It was for the sake of the Name that they went out, receiving no help from the pagans.
643Jn 1:8 We ought therefore to show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth.
643Jn 1:9 I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will have nothing to do with us.
643Jn 1:10 So if I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, gossiping maliciously about us. Not satisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.
643Jn 1:11 Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God.
643Jn 1:12 Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone--and even by the truth itself. We also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is true.
643Jn 1:13 I have much to write you, but I do not want to do so with pen and ink.
643Jn 1:14 I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.

65Jd 1:1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James, To those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept by Jesus Christ£º
65Jd 1:2 Mercy, peace and love be yours in abundance.
65Jd 1:3 Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.
65Jd 1:4 For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men, who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.
65Jd 1:5 Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe.
65Jd 1:6 And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home--these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day.
65Jd 1:7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.
65Jd 1:8 In the very same way, these dreamers pollute their own bodies, reject authority and slander celestial beings.
65Jd 1:9 But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him, but said, "The Lord rebuke you!"
65Jd 1:10 Yet these men speak abusively against whatever they do not understand; and what things they do understand by instinct, like unreasoning animals--these are the very things that destroy them.
65Jd 1:11 Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam's error; they have been destroyed in Korah's rebellion.
65Jd 1:12 These men are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm--shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted--twice dead.
65Jd 1:13 They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.
65Jd 1:14 Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men£º "See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones
65Jd 1:15 to judge everyone, and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way, and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
65Jd 1:16 These men are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.
65Jd 1:17 But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.
65Jd 1:18 They said to you, "In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires."
65Jd 1:19 These are the men who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.
65Jd 1:20 But you, dear friends, build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the Holy Spirit.
65Jd 1:21 Keep yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.
65Jd 1:22 Be merciful to those who doubt;
65Jd 1:23 snatch others from the fire and save them; to others show mercy, mixed with fear--hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.
65Jd 1:24 To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy--
65Jd 1:25 to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.

66Rv 1:1 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
66Rv 1:2 who testifies to everything he saw--that is, the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.
66Rv 1:3 Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near.
66Rv 1:4 John, To the seven churches in the province of Asia£º Grace and peace to you from him who is, and who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before his throne,
66Rv 1:5 and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood,
66Rv 1:6 and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.
66Rv 1:7 Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all the peoples of the earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen.
66Rv 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."
66Rv 1:9 I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
66Rv 1:10 On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
66Rv 1:11 which said£º "Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches£º to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea."
66Rv 1:12 I turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me. And when I turned I saw seven golden lampstands,
66Rv 1:13 and among the lampstands was someone "like a son of man," dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest.
66Rv 1:14 His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like blazing fire.
66Rv 1:15 His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters.
66Rv 1:16 In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance.
66Rv 1:17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. Then he placed his right hand on me and said£º "Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.
66Rv 1:18 I am the Living One; I was dead, and behold I am alive for ever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and Hades.
66Rv 1:19 "Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now and what will take place later.
66Rv 1:20 The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this£º The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
66Rv 2:1 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write£º These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands£º
66Rv 2:2 I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.
66Rv 2:3 You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.
66Rv 2:4 Yet I hold this against you£º You have forsaken your first love.
66Rv 2:5 Remember the height from which you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
66Rv 2:6 But you have this in your favor£º You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
66Rv 2:7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.
66Rv 2:8 "To the angel of the church in Smyrna write£º These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.
66Rv 2:9 I know your afflictions and your poverty--yet you are rich! I know the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
66Rv 2:10 Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life.
66Rv 2:11 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death.
66Rv 2:12 "To the angel of the church in Pergamum write£º These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.
66Rv 2:13 I know where you live--where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city--where Satan lives.
66Rv 2:14 Nevertheless, I have a few things against you£º You have people there who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality.
66Rv 2:15 Likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
66Rv 2:16 Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
66Rv 2:17 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to him who receives it.
66Rv 2:18 "To the angel of the church in Thyatira write£º These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.
66Rv 2:19 I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that you are now doing more than you did at first.
66Rv 2:20 Nevertheless, I have this against you£º You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.
66Rv 2:21 I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.
66Rv 2:22 So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.
66Rv 2:23 I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.
66Rv 2:24 Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets (I will not impose any other burden on you)£º
66Rv 2:25 Only hold on to what you have until I come.
66Rv 2:26 To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations--
66Rv 2:27 'He will rule them with an iron scepter; he will dash them to pieces like pottery'--just as I have received authority from my Father.
66Rv 2:28 I will also give him the morning star.
66Rv 2:29 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
66Rv 3:1 "To the angel of the church in Sardis write£º These are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your deeds; you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
66Rv 3:2 Wake up! Strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my God.
66Rv 3:3 Remember, therefore, what you have received and heard; obey it, and repent. But if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what time I will come to you.
66Rv 3:4 Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.
66Rv 3:5 He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels.
66Rv 3:6 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
66Rv 3:7 "To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write£º These are the words of him who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.
66Rv 3:8 I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
66Rv 3:9 I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews though they are not, but are liars--I will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.
66Rv 3:10 Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth.
66Rv 3:11 I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.
66Rv 3:12 Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on him my new name.
66Rv 3:13 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
66Rv 3:14 "To the angel of the church in Laodicea write£º These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God's creation.
66Rv 3:15 I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other!
66Rv 3:16 So, because you are lukewarm--neither hot nor cold--I am about to spit you out of my mouth.
66Rv 3:17 You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
66Rv 3:18 I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.
66Rv 3:19 Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest, and repent.
66Rv 3:20 Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he with me.
66Rv 3:21 To him who overcomes, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I overcame and sat down with my Father on his throne.
66Rv 3:22 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
66Rv 4:1 After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this."
66Rv 4:2 At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it.
66Rv 4:3 And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian. A rainbow, resembling an emerald, encircled the throne.
66Rv 4:4 Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads.
66Rv 4:5 From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. Before the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits of God.
66Rv 4:6 Also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back.
66Rv 4:7 The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle.
66Rv 4:8 Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under his wings. Day and night they never stop saying£º "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come."
66Rv 4:9 Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever,
66Rv 4:10 the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say£º
66Rv 4:11 "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they were created and have their being."
66Rv 5:1 Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals.
66Rv 5:2 And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, "Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?"
66Rv 5:3 But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it.
66Rv 5:4 I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside.
66Rv 5:5 Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals."
66Rv 5:6 Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing in the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
66Rv 5:7 He came and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne.
66Rv 5:8 And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
66Rv 5:9 And they sang a new song£º "You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.
66Rv 5:10 You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth."
66Rv 5:11 Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders.
66Rv 5:12 In a loud voice they sang£º "Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!"
66Rv 5:13 Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, singing£º "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power, for ever and ever!"
66Rv 5:14 The four living creatures said, "Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.
66Rv 6:1 I watched as the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, "Come!"
66Rv 6:2 I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.
66Rv 6:3 When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!"
66Rv 6:4 Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other. To him was given a large sword.
66Rv 6:5 When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.
66Rv 6:6 Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, "A quart of wheat for a day's wages, and three quarts of barley for a day's wages, and do not damage the oil and the wine!"
66Rv 6:7 When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come!"
66Rv 6:8 I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.
66Rv 6:9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and the testimony they had maintained.
66Rv 6:10 They called out in a loud voice, "How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?"
66Rv 6:11 Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed.
66Rv 6:12 I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red,
66Rv 6:13 and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as late figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind.
66Rv 6:14 The sky receded like a scroll, rolling up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
66Rv 6:15 Then the kings of the earth, the princes, the generals, the rich, the mighty, and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
66Rv 6:16 They called to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!
66Rv 6:17 For the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?"
66Rv 7:1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree.
66Rv 7:2 Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea£º
66Rv 7:3 "Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God."
66Rv 7:4 Then I heard the number of those who were sealed£º 144,000 from all the tribes of Israel.
66Rv 7:5 From the tribe of Judah 12,000 were sealed, from the tribe of Reuben 12,000, from the tribe of Gad 12,000,
66Rv 7:6 from the tribe of Asher 12,000, from the tribe of Naphtali 12,000, from the tribe of Manasseh 12,000,
66Rv 7:7 from the tribe of Simeon 12,000, from the tribe of Levi 12,000, from the tribe of Issachar 12,000,
66Rv 7:8 from the tribe of Zebulun 12,000, from the tribe of Joseph 12,000, from the tribe of Benjamin 12,000.
66Rv 7:9 After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.
66Rv 7:10 And they cried out in a loud voice£º "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."
66Rv 7:11 All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
66Rv 7:12 saying£º "Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!"
66Rv 7:13 Then one of the elders asked me, "These in white robes--who are they, and where did they come from?"
66Rv 7:14 I answered, "Sir, you know." And he said, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
66Rv 7:15 Therefore, "they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.
66Rv 7:16 Never again will they hunger; never again will they thirst. The sun will not beat upon them, nor any scorching heat.
66Rv 7:17 For the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd; he will lead them to springs of living water. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
66Rv 8:1 When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
66Rv 8:2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.
66Rv 8:3 Another angel, who had a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne.
66Rv 8:4 The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, went up before God from the angel's hand.
66Rv 8:5 Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it on the earth; and there came peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning and an earthquake.
66Rv 8:6 Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.
66Rv 8:7 The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled down upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
66Rv 8:8 The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a huge mountain, all ablaze, was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea turned into blood,
66Rv 8:9 a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
66Rv 8:10 The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water--
66Rv 8:11 the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.
66Rv 8:12 The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.
66Rv 8:13 As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice£º "Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!"
66Rv 9:1 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.
66Rv 9:2 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.
66Rv 9:3 And out of the smoke locusts came down upon the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth.
66Rv 9:4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
66Rv 9:5 They were not given power to kill them, but only to torture them for five months. And the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a man.
66Rv 9:6 During those days men will seek death, but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will elude them.
66Rv 9:7 The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.
66Rv 9:8 Their hair was like women's hair, and their teeth were like lions' teeth.
66Rv 9:9 They had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.
66Rv 9:10 They had tails and stings like scorpions, and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months.
66Rv 9:11 They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.
66Rv 9:12 The first woe is past; two other woes are yet to come.
66Rv 9:13 The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the horns of the golden altar that is before God.
66Rv 9:14 It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."
66Rv 9:15 And the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.
66Rv 9:16 The number of the mounted troops was two hundred million. I heard their number.
66Rv 9:17 The horses and riders I saw in my vision looked like this£º Their breastplates were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow as sulfur. The heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke and sulfur.
66Rv 9:18 A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths.
66Rv 9:19 The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like snakes, having heads with which they inflict injury.
66Rv 9:20 The rest of mankind that were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands; they did not stop worshiping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone and wood--idols that cannot see or hear or walk.
66Rv 9:21 Nor did they repent of their murders, their magic arts, their sexual immorality or their thefts.
66Rv 10:1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven. He was robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun, and his legs were like fiery pillars.
66Rv 10:2 He was holding a little scroll, which lay open in his hand. He planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,
66Rv 10:3 and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion. When he shouted, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.
66Rv 10:4 And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from heaven say, "Seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down."
66Rv 10:5 Then the angel I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.
66Rv 10:6 And he swore by him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it, and said, "There will be no more delay!
66Rv 10:7 But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets."
66Rv 10:8 Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me once more£º "Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."
66Rv 10:9 So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, "Take it and eat it. It will turn your stomach sour, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."
66Rv 10:10 I took the little scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned sour.
66Rv 10:11 Then I was told, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages and kings."
66Rv 11:1 I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, "Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count the worshipers there.
66Rv 11:2 But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months.
66Rv 11:3 And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth."
66Rv 11:4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
66Rv 11:5 If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die.
66Rv 11:6 These men have power to shut up the sky so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want.
66Rv 11:7 Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them.
66Rv 11:8 Their bodies will lie in the street of the great city, which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
66Rv 11:9 For three and a half days men from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial.
66Rv 11:10 The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth.
66Rv 11:11 But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them.
66Rv 11:12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here." And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on.
66Rv 11:13 At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
66Rv 11:14 The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon.
66Rv 11:15 The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said£º "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he will reign for ever and ever."
66Rv 11:16 And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God,
66Rv 11:17 saying£º "We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign.
66Rv 11:18 The nations were angry; and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name, both small and great--and for destroying those who destroy the earth."
66Rv 11:19 Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a great hailstorm.
66Rv 12:1 A great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven£º a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head.
66Rv 12:2 She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.
66Rv 12:3 Then another sign appeared in heaven£º an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads.
66Rv 12:4 His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child the moment it was born.
66Rv 12:5 She gave birth to a son, a male child, who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.
66Rv 12:6 The woman fled into the desert to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.
66Rv 12:7 And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.
66Rv 12:8 But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.
66Rv 12:9 The great dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.
66Rv 12:10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say£º "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. For the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down.
66Rv 12:11 They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
66Rv 12:12 Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short."
66Rv 12:13 When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
66Rv 12:14 The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent's reach.
66Rv 12:15 Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent.
66Rv 12:16 But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.
66Rv 12:17 Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring--those who obey God's commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus.
66Rv 13:1 And the dragon stood on the shore of the sea. And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on his horns, and on each head a blasphemous name.
66Rv 13:2 The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority.
66Rv 13:3 One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was astonished and followed the beast.
66Rv 13:4 Men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they also worshiped the beast and asked, "Who is like the beast? Who can make war against him?"
66Rv 13:5 The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise his authority for forty-two months.
66Rv 13:6 He opened his mouth to blaspheme God, and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven.
66Rv 13:7 He was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer them. And he was given authority over every tribe, people, language and nation.
66Rv 13:8 All inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast--all whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the Lamb that was slain from the creation of the world.
66Rv 13:9 He who has an ear, let him hear.
66Rv 13:10 If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity he will go. If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword he will be killed. This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints.
66Rv 13:11 Then I saw another beast, coming out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon.
66Rv 13:12 He exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.
66Rv 13:13 And he performed great and miraculous signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men.
66Rv 13:14 Because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast, he deceived the inhabitants of the earth. He ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
66Rv 13:15 He was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.
66Rv 13:16 He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead,
66Rv 13:17 so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
66Rv 13:18 This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man's number. His number is 666.
66Rv 14:1 Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.
66Rv 14:2 And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps.
66Rv 14:3 And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
66Rv 14:4 These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for they kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were purchased from among men and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb.
66Rv 14:5 No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
66Rv 14:6 Then I saw another angel flying in midair, and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth--to every nation, tribe, language and people.
66Rv 14:7 He said in a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water."
66Rv 14:8 A second angel followed and said, "Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great, which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries."
66Rv 14:9 A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice£º "If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand,
66Rv 14:10 he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.
66Rv 14:11 And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name."
66Rv 14:12 This calls for patient endurance on the part of the saints who obey God's commandments and remain faithful to Jesus.
66Rv 14:13 Then I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write£º Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Yes," says the Spirit, "they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them."
66Rv 14:14 I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one "like a son of man" with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
66Rv 14:15 Then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud, "Take your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is ripe."
66Rv 14:16 So he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
66Rv 14:17 Another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
66Rv 14:18 Still another angel, who had charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, "Take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earth's vine, because its grapes are ripe."
66Rv 14:19 The angel swung his sickle on the earth, gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath.
66Rv 14:20 They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press, rising as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of 1,600 stadia.
66Rv 15:1 I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign£º seven angels with the seven last plagues--last, because with them God's wrath is completed.
66Rv 15:2 And I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire and, standing beside the sea, those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number of his name. They held harps given them by God
66Rv 15:3 and sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb£º "Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the ages.
66Rv 15:4 Who will not fear you, O Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed."
66Rv 15:5 After this I looked and in heaven the temple, that is, the tabernacle of the Testimony, was opened.
66Rv 15:6 Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests.
66Rv 15:7 Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.
66Rv 15:8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
66Rv 16:1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, "Go, pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth."
66Rv 16:2 The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his image.
66Rv 16:3 The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead man, and every living thing in the sea died.
66Rv 16:4 The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.
66Rv 16:5 Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say£º "You are just in these judgments, you who are and who were, the Holy One, because you have so judged;
66Rv 16:6 for they have shed the blood of your saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve."
66Rv 16:7 And I heard the altar respond£º "Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments."
66Rv 16:8 The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was given power to scorch people with fire.
66Rv 16:9 They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him.
66Rv 16:10 The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. Men gnawed their tongues in agony
66Rv 16:11 and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done.
66Rv 16:12 The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East.
66Rv 16:13 Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
66Rv 16:14 They are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.
66Rv 16:15 "Behold, I come like a thief! Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him, so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed."
66Rv 16:16 Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
66Rv 16:17 The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
66Rv 16:18 Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since man has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake.
66Rv 16:19 The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath.
66Rv 16:20 Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found.
66Rv 16:21 From the sky huge hailstones of about a hundred pounds each fell upon men. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible.
66Rv 17:1 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the punishment of the great prostitute, who sits on many waters.
66Rv 17:2 With her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries."
66Rv 17:3 Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns.
66Rv 17:4 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and was glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries.
66Rv 17:5 This title was written on her forehead£º MYSTERY BABYLON THE GREAT THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
66Rv 17:6 I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of those who bore testimony to Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly astonished.
66Rv 17:7 Then the angel said to me£º "Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides, which has the seven heads and ten horns.
66Rv 17:8 The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast, because he once was, now is not, and yet will come.
66Rv 17:9 "This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits.
66Rv 17:10 They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for a little while.
66Rv 17:11 The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction.
66Rv 17:12 "The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.
66Rv 17:13 They have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.
66Rv 17:14 They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings--and with him will be his called, chosen and faithful followers."
66Rv 17:15 Then the angel said to me, "The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations and languages.
66Rv 17:16 The beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute. They will bring her to ruin and leave her naked; they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
66Rv 17:17 For God has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until God's words are fulfilled.
66Rv 17:18 The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth."
66Rv 18:1 After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.
66Rv 18:2 With a mighty voice he shouted£º "Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great! She has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil spirit, a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird.
66Rv 18:3 For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries."
66Rv 18:4 Then I heard another voice from heaven say£º "Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues;
66Rv 18:5 for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.
66Rv 18:6 Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for what she has done. Mix her a double portion from her own cup.
66Rv 18:7 Give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself. In her heart she boasts, 'I sit as queen; I am not a widow, and I will never mourn.'
66Rv 18:8 Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her£º death, mourning and famine. She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.
66Rv 18:9 "When the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning, they will weep and mourn over her.
66Rv 18:10 Terrified at her torment, they will stand far off and cry£º "'Woe! Woe, O great city, O Babylon, city of power! In one hour your doom has come!'
66Rv 18:11 "The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more--
66Rv 18:12 cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;
66Rv 18:13 cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and carriages; and bodies and souls of men.
66Rv 18:14 "They will say, 'The fruit you longed for is gone from you. All your riches and splendor have vanished, never to be recovered.'
66Rv 18:15 The merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off, terrified at her torment. They will weep and mourn
66Rv 18:16 and cry out£º "'Woe! Woe, O great city, dressed in fine linen, purple and scarlet, and glittering with gold, precious stones and pearls!
66Rv 18:17 In one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin!' "Every sea captain, and all who travel by ship, the sailors, and all who earn their living from the sea, will stand far off.
66Rv 18:18 When they see the smoke of her burning, they will exclaim, 'Was there ever a city like this great city?'
66Rv 18:19 They will throw dust on their heads, and with weeping and mourning cry out£º "'Woe! Woe, O great city, where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth! In one hour she has been brought to ruin!
66Rv 18:20 Rejoice over her, O heaven! Rejoice, saints and apostles and prophets! God has judged her for the way she treated you.'"
66Rv 18:21 Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea, and said£º "With such violence the great city of Babylon will be thrown down, never to be found again.
66Rv 18:22 The music of harpists and musicians, flute players and trumpeters, will never be heard in you again. No workman of any trade will ever be found in you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again.
66Rv 18:23 The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again. Your merchants were the world's great men. By your magic spell all the nations were led astray.
66Rv 18:24 In her was found the blood of prophets and of the saints, and of all who have been killed on the earth."
66Rv 19:1 After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting£º "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
66Rv 19:2 for true and just are his judgments. He has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries. He has avenged on her the blood of his servants."
66Rv 19:3 And again they shouted£º "Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever."
66Rv 19:4 The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried£º "Amen, Hallelujah!"
66Rv 19:5 Then a voice came from the throne, saying£º "Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, both small and great!"
66Rv 19:6 Then I heard what sounded like a great multitude, like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder, shouting£º "Hallelujah! For our Lord God Almighty reigns.
66Rv 19:7 Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready.
66Rv 19:8 Fine linen, bright and clean, was given her to wear." (Fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the saints.)
66Rv 19:9 Then the angel said to me, "Write£º 'Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb!'" And he added, "These are the true words of God."
66Rv 19:10 At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, "Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."
66Rv 19:11 I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and makes war.
66Rv 19:12 His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself.
66Rv 19:13 He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God.
66Rv 19:14 The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean.
66Rv 19:15 Out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. "He will rule them with an iron scepter." He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
66Rv 19:16 On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written£º KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.
66Rv 19:17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, "Come, gather together for the great supper of God,
66Rv 19:18 so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and mighty men, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, small and great."
66Rv 19:19 Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army.
66Rv 19:20 But the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who had performed the miraculous signs on his behalf. With these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped his image. The two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.
66Rv 19:21 The rest of them were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
66Rv 20:1 And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain.
66Rv 20:2 He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:3 He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time.
66Rv 20:4 I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.
66Rv 20:5 (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection.
66Rv 20:6 Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:7 When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison
66Rv 20:8 and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth--Gog and Magog--to gather them for battle. In number they are like the sand on the seashore.
66Rv 20:9 They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
66Rv 20:10 And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
66Rv 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them.
66Rv 20:12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.
66Rv 20:13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done.
66Rv 20:14 Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.
66Rv 20:15 If anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
66Rv 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
66Rv 21:2 I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
66Rv 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.
66Rv 21:4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away."
66Rv 21:5 He who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."
66Rv 21:6 He said to me£º "It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life.
66Rv 21:7 He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son.
66Rv 21:8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."
66Rv 21:9 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
66Rv 21:10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.
66Rv 21:11 It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
66Rv 21:12 It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.
66Rv 21:13 There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.
66Rv 21:14 The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
66Rv 21:15 The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls.
66Rv 21:16 The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long.
66Rv 21:17 He measured its wall and it was 144 cubits thick, by man's measurement, which the angel was using.
66Rv 21:18 The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.
66Rv 21:19 The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
66Rv 21:20 the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.
66Rv 21:21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of pure gold, like transparent glass.
66Rv 21:22 I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
66Rv 21:23 The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.
66Rv 21:24 The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.
66Rv 21:25 On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.
66Rv 21:26 The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.
66Rv 21:27 Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.
66Rv 22:1 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66Rv 22:2 down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
66Rv 22:3 No longer will there be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and his servants will serve him.
66Rv 22:4 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
66Rv 22:5 There will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light. And they will reign for ever and ever.
66Rv 22:6 The angel said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place."
66Rv 22:7 "Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book."
66Rv 22:8 I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I had heard and seen them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me.
66Rv 22:9 But he said to me, "Do not do it! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all who keep the words of this book. Worship God!"
66Rv 22:10 Then he told me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near.
66Rv 22:11 Let him who does wrong continue to do wrong; let him who is vile continue to be vile; let him who does right continue to do right; and let him who is holy continue to be holy."
66Rv 22:12 "Behold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done.
66Rv 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.
66Rv 22:14 "Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city.
66Rv 22:15 Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
66Rv 22:16 "I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star."
66Rv 22:17 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life.
66Rv 22:18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book£º If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.
66Rv 22:19 And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.
66Rv 22:20 He who testifies to these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.
66Rv 22:21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. Amen.
