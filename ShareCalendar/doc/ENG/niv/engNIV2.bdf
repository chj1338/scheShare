05
05Dt 1:1 These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel in the desert east of the Jordan--that is, in the Arabah--opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab.
05Dt 1:2 (It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)
05Dt 1:3 In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them.
05Dt 1:4 This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.
05Dt 1:5 East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying£º
05Dt 1:6 The LORD our God said to us at Horeb, "You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
05Dt 1:7 Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.
05Dt 1:8 See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land that the LORD swore he would give to your fathers--to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--and to their descendants after them."
05Dt 1:9 At that time I said to you, "You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.
05Dt 1:10 The LORD your God has increased your numbers so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky.
05Dt 1:11 May the LORD, the God of your fathers, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!
05Dt 1:12 But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?
05Dt 1:13 Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you."
05Dt 1:14 You answered me, "What you propose to do is good."
05Dt 1:15 So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you--as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.
05Dt 1:16 And I charged your judges at that time£º Hear the disputes between your brothers and judge fairly, whether the case is between brother Israelites or between one of them and an alien.
05Dt 1:17 Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of any man, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.
05Dt 1:18 And at that time I told you everything you were to do.
05Dt 1:19 Then, as the LORD our God commanded us, we set out from Horeb and went toward the hill country of the Amorites through all that vast and dreadful desert that you have seen, and so we reached Kadesh Barnea.
05Dt 1:20 Then I said to you, "You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God is giving us.
05Dt 1:21 See, the LORD your God has given you the land. Go up and take possession of it as the LORD, the God of your fathers, told you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."
05Dt 1:22 Then all of you came to me and said, "Let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to."
05Dt 1:23 The idea seemed good to me; so I selected twelve of you, one man from each tribe.
05Dt 1:24 They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and explored it.
05Dt 1:25 Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, "It is a good land that the LORD our God is giving us."
05Dt 1:26 But you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.
05Dt 1:27 You grumbled in your tents and said, "The LORD hates us; so he brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.
05Dt 1:28 Where can we go? Our brothers have made us lose heart. They say, 'The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large, with walls up to the sky. We even saw the Anakites there.'"
05Dt 1:29 Then I said to you, "Do not be terrified; do not be afraid of them.
05Dt 1:30 The LORD your God, who is going before you, will fight for you, as he did for you in Egypt, before your very eyes,
05Dt 1:31 and in the desert. There you saw how the LORD your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place."
05Dt 1:32 In spite of this, you did not trust in the LORD your God,
05Dt 1:33 who went ahead of you on your journey, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go.
05Dt 1:34 When the LORD heard what you said, he was angry and solemnly swore£º
05Dt 1:35 "Not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your forefathers,
05Dt 1:36 except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the LORD wholeheartedly."
05Dt 1:37 Because of you the LORD became angry with me also and said, "You shall not enter it, either.
05Dt 1:38 But your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will enter it. Encourage him, because he will lead Israel to inherit it.
05Dt 1:39 And the little ones that you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad--they will enter the land. I will give it to them and they will take possession of it.
05Dt 1:40 But as for you, turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea."
05Dt 1:41 Then you replied, "We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, as the LORD our God commanded us." So every one of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.
05Dt 1:42 But the LORD said to me, "Tell them, 'Do not go up and fight, because I will not be with you. You will be defeated by your enemies.'"
05Dt 1:43 So I told you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the LORD'S command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country.
05Dt 1:44 The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir all the way to Hormah.
05Dt 1:45 You came back and wept before the LORD, but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.
05Dt 1:46 And so you stayed in Kadesh many days--all the time you spent there.
05Dt 2:1 Then we turned back and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea, as the LORD had directed me. For a long time we made our way around the hill country of Seir.
05Dt 2:2 Then the LORD said to me,
05Dt 2:3 "You have made your way around this hill country long enough; now turn north.
05Dt 2:4 Give the people these orders£º 'You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.
05Dt 2:5 Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even enough to put your foot on. I have given Esau the hill country of Seir as his own.
05Dt 2:6 You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.'"
05Dt 2:7 The LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast desert. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you, and you have not lacked anything.
05Dt 2:8 So we went on past our brothers the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We turned from the Arabah road, which comes up from Elath and Ezion Geber, and traveled along the desert road of Moab.
05Dt 2:9 Then the LORD said to me, "Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession."
05Dt 2:10 (The Emites used to live there--a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites.
05Dt 2:11 Like the Anakites, they too were considered Rephaites, but the Moabites called them Emites.
05Dt 2:12 Horites used to live in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out. They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land the LORD gave them as their possession.)
05Dt 2:13 And the LORD said, "Now get up and cross the Zered Valley." So we crossed the valley.
05Dt 2:14 Thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley. By then, that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.
05Dt 2:15 The LORD'S hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp.
05Dt 2:16 Now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died,
05Dt 2:17 the LORD said to me,
05Dt 2:18 "Today you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.
05Dt 2:19 When you come to the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot."
05Dt 2:20 (That too was considered a land of the Rephaites, who used to live there; but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites.
05Dt 2:21 They were a people strong and numerous, and as tall as the Anakites. The LORD destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place.
05Dt 2:22 The LORD had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.
05Dt 2:23 And as for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place.)
05Dt 2:24 "Set out now and cross the Arnon Gorge. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.
05Dt 2:25 This very day I will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you."
05Dt 2:26 From the desert of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon offering peace and saying,
05Dt 2:27 "Let us pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.
05Dt 2:28 Sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver. Only let us pass through on foot--
05Dt 2:29 as the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for us--until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us."
05Dt 2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon refused to let us pass through. For the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands, as he has now done.
05Dt 2:31 The LORD said to me, "See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land."
05Dt 2:32 When Sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at Jahaz,
05Dt 2:33 the LORD our God delivered him over to us and we struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army.
05Dt 2:34 At that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed them--men, women and children. We left no survivors.
05Dt 2:35 But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves.
05Dt 2:36 From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them.
05Dt 2:37 But in accordance with the command of the LORD our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.
05Dt 3:1 Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei.
05Dt 3:2 The LORD said to me, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."
05Dt 3:3 So the LORD our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors.
05Dt 3:4 At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them--the whole region of Argob, Og's kingdom in Bashan.
05Dt 3:5 All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages.
05Dt 3:6 We completely destroyed them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying every city--men, women and children.
05Dt 3:7 But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves.
05Dt 3:8 So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon.
05Dt 3:9 (Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.)
05Dt 3:10 We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns of Og's kingdom in Bashan.
05Dt 3:11 (Only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)
05Dt 3:12 Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns.
05Dt 3:13 The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites.
05Dt 3:14 Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.)
05Dt 3:15 And I gave Gilead to Makir.
05Dt 3:16 But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites.
05Dt 3:17 Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.
05Dt 3:18 I commanded you at that time£º "The LORD your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of your brother Israelites.
05Dt 3:19 However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you,
05Dt 3:20 until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the LORD your God is giving them, across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you."
05Dt 3:21 At that time I commanded Joshua£º "You have seen with your own eyes all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings. The LORD will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going.
05Dt 3:22 Do not be afraid of them; the LORD your God himself will fight for you."
05Dt 3:23 At that time I pleaded with the LORD£º
05Dt 3:24 "O Sovereign LORD, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do?
05Dt 3:25 Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan--that fine hill country and Lebanon."
05Dt 3:26 But because of you the LORD was angry with me and would not listen to me. "That is enough," the LORD said. "Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.
05Dt 3:27 Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan.
05Dt 3:28 But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see."
05Dt 3:29 So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor.
05Dt 4:1 Hear now, O Israel, the decrees and laws I am about to teach you. Follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you.
05Dt 4:2 Do not add to what I command you and do not subtract from it, but keep the commands of the LORD your God that I give you.
05Dt 4:3 You saw with your own eyes what the LORD did at Baal Peor. The LORD your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor,
05Dt 4:4 but all of you who held fast to the LORD your God are still alive today.
05Dt 4:5 See, I have taught you decrees and laws as the LORD my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it.
05Dt 4:6 Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these decrees and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."
05Dt 4:7 What other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the LORD our God is near us whenever we pray to him?
05Dt 4:8 And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws I am setting before you today?
05Dt 4:9 Only be careful, and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them slip from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and to their children after them.
05Dt 4:10 Remember the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, when he said to me, "Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children."
05Dt 4:11 You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens, with black clouds and deep darkness.
05Dt 4:12 Then the LORD spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.
05Dt 4:13 He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets.
05Dt 4:14 And the LORD directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
05Dt 4:15 You saw no form of any kind the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire. Therefore watch yourselves very carefully,
05Dt 4:16 so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether formed like a man or a woman,
05Dt 4:17 or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air,
05Dt 4:18 or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below.
05Dt 4:19 And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars--all the heavenly array--do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.
05Dt 4:20 But as for you, the LORD took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be the people of his inheritance, as you now are.
05Dt 4:21 The LORD was angry with me because of you, and he solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance.
05Dt 4:22 I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.
05Dt 4:23 Be careful not to forget the covenant of the LORD your God that he made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the LORD your God has forbidden.
05Dt 4:24 For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.
05Dt 4:25 After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time--if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol, doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God and provoking him to anger,
05Dt 4:26 I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.
05Dt 4:27 The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the LORD will drive you.
05Dt 4:28 There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.
05Dt 4:29 But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul.
05Dt 4:30 When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD your God and obey him.
05Dt 4:31 For the LORD your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your forefathers, which he confirmed to them by oath.
05Dt 4:32 Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created man on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?
05Dt 4:33 Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire, as you have, and lived?
05Dt 4:34 Has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation, by testings, by miraculous signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?
05Dt 4:35 You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides him there is no other.
05Dt 4:36 From heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you. On earth he showed you his great fire, and you heard his words from out of the fire.
05Dt 4:37 Because he loved your forefathers and chose their descendants after them, he brought you out of Egypt by his Presence and his great strength,
05Dt 4:38 to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.
05Dt 4:39 Acknowledge and take to heart this day that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other.
05Dt 4:40 Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the LORD your God gives you for all time.
05Dt 4:41 Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan,
05Dt 4:42 to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if he had unintentionally killed his neighbor without malice aforethought. He could flee into one of these cities and save his life.
05Dt 4:43 The cities were these£º Bezer in the desert plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.
05Dt 4:44 This is the law Moses set before the Israelites.
05Dt 4:45 These are the stipulations, decrees and laws Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt
05Dt 4:46 and were in the valley near Beth Peor east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt.
05Dt 4:47 They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan.
05Dt 4:48 This land extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Siyon (that is, Hermon),
05Dt 4:49 and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah.
05Dt 5:1 Moses summoned all Israel and said£º Hear, O Israel, the decrees and laws I declare in your hearing today. Learn them and be sure to follow them.
05Dt 5:2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.
05Dt 5:3 It was not with our fathers that the LORD made this covenant, but with us, with all of us who are alive here today.
05Dt 5:4 The LORD spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.
05Dt 5:5 (At that time I stood between the LORD and you to declare to you the word of the LORD, because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain.) And he said£º
05Dt 5:6 "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
05Dt 5:7 "You shall have no other gods before me.
05Dt 5:8 "You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
05Dt 5:9 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
05Dt 5:10 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
05Dt 5:11 "You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
05Dt 5:12 "Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you.
05Dt 5:13 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
05Dt 5:14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor the alien within your gates, so that your manservant and maidservant may rest, as you do.
05Dt 5:15 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the LORD your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.
05Dt 5:16 "Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 5:17 "You shall not murder.
05Dt 5:18 "You shall not commit adultery.
05Dt 5:19 "You shall not steal.
05Dt 5:20 "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
05Dt 5:21 "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife. You shall not set your desire on your neighbor's house or land, his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
05Dt 5:22 These are the commandments the LORD proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud and the deep darkness; and he added nothing more. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
05Dt 5:23 When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leading men of your tribes and your elders came to me.
05Dt 5:24 And you said, "The LORD our God has shown us his glory and his majesty, and we have heard his voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a man can live even if God speaks with him.
05Dt 5:25 But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer.
05Dt 5:26 For what mortal man has ever heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and survived?
05Dt 5:27 Go near and listen to all that the LORD our God says. Then tell us whatever the LORD our God tells you. We will listen and obey."
05Dt 5:28 The LORD heard you when you spoke to me and the LORD said to me, "I have heard what this people said to you. Everything they said was good.
05Dt 5:29 Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever!
05Dt 5:30 "Go, tell them to return to their tents.
05Dt 5:31 But you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess."
05Dt 5:32 So be careful to do what the LORD your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left.
05Dt 5:33 Walk in all the way that the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.
05Dt 6:1 These are the commands, decrees and laws the LORD your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,
05Dt 6:2 so that you, your children and their children after them may fear the LORD your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you, and so that you may enjoy long life.
05Dt 6:3 Hear, O Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, promised you.
05Dt 6:4 Hear, O Israel£º The LORD our God, the LORD is one.
05Dt 6:5 Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
05Dt 6:6 These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts.
05Dt 6:7 Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
05Dt 6:8 Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
05Dt 6:9 Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates.
05Dt 6:10 When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you--a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build,
05Dt 6:11 houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant--then when you eat and are satisfied,
05Dt 6:12 be careful that you do not forget the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
05Dt 6:13 Fear the LORD your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name.
05Dt 6:14 Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you;
05Dt 6:15 for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of the land.
05Dt 6:16 Do not test the LORD your God as you did at Massah.
05Dt 6:17 Be sure to keep the commands of the LORD your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you.
05Dt 6:18 Do what is right and good in the LORD'S sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land that the LORD promised on oath to your forefathers,
05Dt 6:19 thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the LORD said.
05Dt 6:20 In the future, when your son asks you, "What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees and laws the LORD our God has commanded you?"
05Dt 6:21 tell him£º "We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
05Dt 6:22 Before our eyes the LORD sent miraculous signs and wonders--great and terrible--upon Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household.
05Dt 6:23 But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land that he promised on oath to our forefathers.
05Dt 6:24 The LORD commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the LORD our God, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today.
05Dt 6:25 And if we are careful to obey all this law before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us, that will be our righteousness."
05Dt 7:1 When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations--the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you--
05Dt 7:2 and when the LORD your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy.
05Dt 7:3 Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons,
05Dt 7:4 for they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods, and the LORD'S anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you.
05Dt 7:5 This is what you are to do to them£º Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols in the fire.
05Dt 7:6 For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. The LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession.
05Dt 7:7 The LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.
05Dt 7:8 But it was because the LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your forefathers that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.
05Dt 7:9 Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands.
05Dt 7:10 But those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction; he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him.
05Dt 7:11 Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today.
05Dt 7:12 If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the LORD your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your forefathers.
05Dt 7:13 He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land--your grain, new wine and oil--the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land that he swore to your forefathers to give you.
05Dt 7:14 You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor any of your livestock without young.
05Dt 7:15 The LORD will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you.
05Dt 7:16 You must destroy all the peoples the LORD your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you.
05Dt 7:17 You may say to yourselves, "These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?"
05Dt 7:18 But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.
05Dt 7:19 You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the miraculous signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the LORD your God brought you out. The LORD your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.
05Dt 7:20 Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished.
05Dt 7:21 Do not be terrified by them, for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God.
05Dt 7:22 The LORD your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you.
05Dt 7:23 But the LORD your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed.
05Dt 7:24 He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them.
05Dt 7:25 The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the LORD your God.
05Dt 7:26 Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Utterly abhor and detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.
05Dt 8:1 Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land that the LORD promised on oath to your forefathers.
05Dt 8:2 Remember how the LORD your God led you all the way in the desert these forty years, to humble you and to test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands.
05Dt 8:3 He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your fathers had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
05Dt 8:4 Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years.
05Dt 8:5 Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the LORD your God disciplines you.
05Dt 8:6 Observe the commands of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and revering him.
05Dt 8:7 For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land--a land with streams and pools of water, with springs flowing in the valleys and hills;
05Dt 8:8 a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey;
05Dt 8:9 a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills.
05Dt 8:10 When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the LORD your God for the good land he has given you.
05Dt 8:11 Be careful that you do not forget the LORD your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day.
05Dt 8:12 Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down,
05Dt 8:13 and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied,
05Dt 8:14 then your heart will become proud and you will forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
05Dt 8:15 He led you through the vast and dreadful desert, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock.
05Dt 8:16 He gave you manna to eat in the desert, something your fathers had never known, to humble and to test you so that in the end it might go well with you.
05Dt 8:17 You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me."
05Dt 8:18 But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your forefathers, as it is today.
05Dt 8:19 If you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed.
05Dt 8:20 Like the nations the LORD destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the LORD your God.
05Dt 9:1 Hear, O Israel. You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky.
05Dt 9:2 The people are strong and tall--Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said£º "Who can stand up against the Anakites?"
05Dt 9:3 But be assured today that the LORD your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the LORD has promised you.
05Dt 9:4 After the LORD your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, "The LORD has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness." No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is going to drive them out before you.
05Dt 9:5 It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the LORD your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
05Dt 9:6 Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people.
05Dt 9:7 Remember this and never forget how you provoked the LORD your God to anger in the desert. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the LORD.
05Dt 9:8 At Horeb you aroused the LORD'S wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you.
05Dt 9:9 When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the LORD had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water.
05Dt 9:10 The LORD gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the LORD proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly.
05Dt 9:11 At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the LORD gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant.
05Dt 9:12 Then the LORD told me, "Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made a cast idol for themselves."
05Dt 9:13 And the LORD said to me, "I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed!
05Dt 9:14 Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they."
05Dt 9:15 So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands.
05Dt 9:16 When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the LORD your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you.
05Dt 9:17 So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes.
05Dt 9:18 Then once again I fell prostrate before the LORD for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the LORD'S sight and so provoking him to anger.
05Dt 9:19 I feared the anger and wrath of the LORD, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the LORD listened to me.
05Dt 9:20 And the LORD was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too.
05Dt 9:21 Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.
05Dt 9:22 You also made the LORD angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah.
05Dt 9:23 And when the LORD sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, "Go up and take possession of the land I have given you." But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. You did not trust him or obey him.
05Dt 9:24 You have been rebellious against the LORD ever since I have known you.
05Dt 9:25 I lay prostrate before the LORD those forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said he would destroy you.
05Dt 9:26 I prayed to the LORD and said, "O Sovereign LORD, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
05Dt 9:27 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin.
05Dt 9:28 Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, 'Because the LORD was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the desert.'
05Dt 9:29 But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm."
05Dt 10:1 At that time the LORD said to me, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden chest.
05Dt 10:2 I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the chest."
05Dt 10:3 So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.
05Dt 10:4 The LORD wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the LORD gave them to me.
05Dt 10:5 Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the LORD commanded me, and they are there now.
05Dt 10:6 (The Israelites traveled from the wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest.
05Dt 10:7 From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water.
05Dt 10:8 At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today.
05Dt 10:9 That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as the LORD your God told them.)
05Dt 10:10 Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and nights, as I did the first time, and the LORD listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you.
05Dt 10:11 "Go," the LORD said to me, "and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land that I swore to their fathers to give them."
05Dt 10:12 And now, O Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul,
05Dt 10:13 and to observe the LORD'S commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?
05Dt 10:14 To the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it.
05Dt 10:15 Yet the LORD set his affection on your forefathers and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations, as it is today.
05Dt 10:16 Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer.
05Dt 10:17 For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.
05Dt 10:18 He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the alien, giving him food and clothing.
05Dt 10:19 And you are to love those who are aliens, for you yourselves were aliens in Egypt.
05Dt 10:20 Fear the LORD your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name.
05Dt 10:21 He is your praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes.
05Dt 10:22 Your forefathers who went down into Egypt were seventy in all, and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
05Dt 11:1 Love the LORD your God and keep his requirements, his decrees, his laws and his commands always.
05Dt 11:2 Remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the LORD your God£º his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm;
05Dt 11:3 the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of Egypt, both to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his whole country;
05Dt 11:4 what he did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the Red Sea as they were pursuing you, and how the LORD brought lasting ruin on them.
05Dt 11:5 It was not your children who saw what he did for you in the desert until you arrived at this place,
05Dt 11:6 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all Israel and swallowed them up with their households, their tents and every living thing that belonged to them.
05Dt 11:7 But it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the LORD has done.
05Dt 11:8 Observe therefore all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess,
05Dt 11:9 and so that you may live long in the land that the LORD swore to your forefathers to give to them and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.
05Dt 11:10 The land you are entering to take over is not like the land of Egypt, from which you have come, where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden.
05Dt 11:11 But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven.
05Dt 11:12 It is a land the LORD your God cares for; the eyes of the LORD your God are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end.
05Dt 11:13 So if you faithfully obey the commands I am giving you today--to love the LORD your God and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul--
05Dt 11:14 then I will send rain on your land in its season, both autumn and spring rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine and oil.
05Dt 11:15 I will provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.
05Dt 11:16 Be careful, or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them.
05Dt 11:17 Then the LORD'S anger will burn against you, and he will shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the LORD is giving you.
05Dt 11:18 Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
05Dt 11:19 Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
05Dt 11:20 Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates,
05Dt 11:21 so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land that the LORD swore to give your forefathers, as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth.
05Dt 11:22 If you carefully observe all these commands I am giving you to follow--to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways and to hold fast to him--
05Dt 11:23 then the LORD will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you.
05Dt 11:24 Every place where you set your foot will be yours£º Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the western sea.
05Dt 11:25 No man will be able to stand against you. The LORD your God, as he promised you, will put the terror and fear of you on the whole land, wherever you go.
05Dt 11:26 See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse--
05Dt 11:27 the blessing if you obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today;
05Dt 11:28 the curse if you disobey the commands of the LORD your God and turn from the way that I command you today by following other gods, which you have not known.
05Dt 11:29 When the LORD your God has brought you into the land you are entering to possess, you are to proclaim on Mount Gerizim the blessings, and on Mount Ebal the curses.
05Dt 11:30 As you know, these mountains are across the Jordan, west of the road, toward the setting sun, near the great trees of Moreh, in the territory of those Canaanites living in the Arabah in the vicinity of Gilgal.
05Dt 11:31 You are about to cross the Jordan to enter and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you. When you have taken it over and are living there,
05Dt 11:32 be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws I am setting before you today.
05Dt 12:1 These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess--as long as you live in the land.
05Dt 12:2 Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains and on the hills and under every spreading tree where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods.
05Dt 12:3 Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places.
05Dt 12:4 You must not worship the LORD your God in their way.
05Dt 12:5 But you are to seek the place the LORD your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go;
05Dt 12:6 there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.
05Dt 12:7 There, in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the LORD your God has blessed you.
05Dt 12:8 You are not to do as we do here today, everyone as he sees fit,
05Dt 12:9 since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 12:10 But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety.
05Dt 12:11 Then to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name--there you are to bring everything I command you£º your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the LORD.
05Dt 12:12 And there rejoice before the LORD your God, you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites from your towns, who have no allotment or inheritance of their own.
05Dt 12:13 Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please.
05Dt 12:14 Offer them only at the place the LORD will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I command you.
05Dt 12:15 Nevertheless, you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were gazelle or deer, according to the blessing the LORD your God gives you. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it.
05Dt 12:16 But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
05Dt 12:17 You must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or whatever you have vowed to give, or your freewill offerings or special gifts.
05Dt 12:18 Instead, you are to eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place the LORD your God will choose--you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites from your towns--and you are to rejoice before the LORD your God in everything you put your hand to.
05Dt 12:19 Be careful not to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.
05Dt 12:20 When the LORD your God has enlarged your territory as he promised you, and you crave meat and say, "I would like some meat," then you may eat as much of it as you want.
05Dt 12:21 If the place where the LORD your God chooses to put his Name is too far away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the LORD has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want.
05Dt 12:22 Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat.
05Dt 12:23 But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat.
05Dt 12:24 You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
05Dt 12:25 Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD.
05Dt 12:26 But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the LORD will choose.
05Dt 12:27 Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God, both the meat and the blood. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat.
05Dt 12:28 Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the LORD your God.
05Dt 12:29 The LORD your God will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess. But when you have driven them out and settled in their land,
05Dt 12:30 and after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods, saying, "How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same."
05Dt 12:31 You must not worship the LORD your God in their way, because in worshiping their gods, they do all kinds of detestable things the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods.
05Dt 12:32 See that you do all I command you; do not add to it or take away from it.
05Dt 13:1 If a prophet, or one who foretells by dreams, appears among you and announces to you a miraculous sign or wonder,
05Dt 13:2 and if the sign or wonder of which he has spoken takes place, and he says, "Let us follow other gods" (gods you have not known) "and let us worship them,"
05Dt 13:3 you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul.
05Dt 13:4 It is the LORD your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him.
05Dt 13:5 That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, because he preached rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; he has tried to turn you from the way the LORD your God commanded you to follow. You must purge the evil from among you.
05Dt 13:6 If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, "Let us go and worship other gods" (gods that neither you nor your fathers have known,
05Dt 13:7 gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other),
05Dt 13:8 do not yield to him or listen to him. Show him no pity. Do not spare him or shield him.
05Dt 13:9 You must certainly put him to death. Your hand must be the first in putting him to death, and then the hands of all the people.
05Dt 13:10 Stone him to death, because he tried to turn you away from the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
05Dt 13:11 Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do such an evil thing again.
05Dt 13:12 If you hear it said about one of the towns the LORD your God is giving you to live in
05Dt 13:13 that wicked men have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, "Let us go and worship other gods" (gods you have not known),
05Dt 13:14 then you must inquire, probe and investigate it thoroughly. And if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you,
05Dt 13:15 you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. Destroy it completely, both its people and its livestock.
05Dt 13:16 Gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It is to remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt.
05Dt 13:17 None of those condemned things shall be found in your hands, so that the LORD will turn from his fierce anger; he will show you mercy, have compassion on you, and increase your numbers, as he promised on oath to your forefathers,
05Dt 13:18 because you obey the LORD your God, keeping all his commands that I am giving you today and doing what is right in his eyes.
05Dt 14:1 You are the children of the LORD your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the dead,
05Dt 14:2 for you are a people holy to the LORD your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth, the LORD has chosen you to be his treasured possession.
05Dt 14:3 Do not eat any detestable thing.
05Dt 14:4 These are the animals you may eat£º the ox, the sheep, the goat,
05Dt 14:5 the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep.
05Dt 14:6 You may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided in two and that chews the cud.
05Dt 14:7 However, of those that chew the cud or that have a split hoof completely divided you may not eat the camel, the rabbit or the coney. Although they chew the cud, they do not have a split hoof; they are ceremonially unclean for you.
05Dt 14:8 The pig is also unclean; although it has a split hoof, it does not chew the cud. You are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses.
05Dt 14:9 Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that has fins and scales.
05Dt 14:10 But anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat; for you it is unclean.
05Dt 14:11 You may eat any clean bird.
05Dt 14:12 But these you may not eat£º the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,
05Dt 14:13 the red kite, the black kite, any kind of falcon,
05Dt 14:14 any kind of raven,
05Dt 14:15 the horned owl, the screech owl, the gull, any kind of hawk,
05Dt 14:16 the little owl, the great owl, the white owl,
05Dt 14:17 the desert owl, the osprey, the cormorant,
05Dt 14:18 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.
05Dt 14:19 All flying insects that swarm are unclean to you; do not eat them.
05Dt 14:20 But any winged creature that is clean you may eat.
05Dt 14:21 Do not eat anything you find already dead. You may give it to an alien living in any of your towns, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. But you are a people holy to the LORD your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
05Dt 14:22 Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year.
05Dt 14:23 Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine and oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name, so that you may learn to revere the LORD your God always.
05Dt 14:24 But if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the LORD your God and cannot carry your tithe (because the place where the LORD will choose to put his Name is so far away),
05Dt 14:25 then exchange your tithe for silver, and take the silver with you and go to the place the LORD your God will choose.
05Dt 14:26 Use the silver to buy whatever you like£º cattle, sheep, wine or other fermented drink, or anything you wish. Then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice.
05Dt 14:27 And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own.
05Dt 14:28 At the end of every three years, bring all the tithes of that year's produce and store it in your towns,
05Dt 14:29 so that the Levites (who have no allotment or inheritance of their own) and the aliens, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied, and so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
05Dt 15:1 At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts.
05Dt 15:2 This is how it is to be done£º Every creditor shall cancel the loan he has made to his fellow Israelite. He shall not require payment from his fellow Israelite or brother, because the LORD'S time for canceling debts has been proclaimed.
05Dt 15:3 You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your brother owes you.
05Dt 15:4 However, there should be no poor among you, for in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you,
05Dt 15:5 if only you fully obey the LORD your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today.
05Dt 15:6 For the LORD your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you.
05Dt 15:7 If there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the land that the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor brother.
05Dt 15:8 Rather be openhanded and freely lend him whatever he needs.
05Dt 15:9 Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought£º "The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near," so that you do not show ill will toward your needy brother and give him nothing. He may then appeal to the LORD against you, and you will be found guilty of sin.
05Dt 15:10 Give generously to him and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to.
05Dt 15:11 There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your brothers and toward the poor and needy in your land.
05Dt 15:12 If a fellow Hebrew, a man or a woman, sells himself to you and serves you six years, in the seventh year you must let him go free.
05Dt 15:13 And when you release him, do not send him away empty-handed.
05Dt 15:14 Supply him liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you.
05Dt 15:15 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today.
05Dt 15:16 But if your servant says to you, "I do not want to leave you," because he loves you and your family and is well off with you,
05Dt 15:17 then take an awl and push it through his ear lobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your maidservant.
05Dt 15:18 Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because his service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.
05Dt 15:19 Set apart for the LORD your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your oxen to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep.
05Dt 15:20 Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose.
05Dt 15:21 If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.
05Dt 15:22 You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer.
05Dt 15:23 But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
05Dt 16:1 Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover of the LORD your God, because in the month of Abib he brought you out of Egypt by night.
05Dt 16:2 Sacrifice as the Passover to the LORD your God an animal from your flock or herd at the place the LORD will choose as a dwelling for his Name.
05Dt 16:3 Do not eat it with bread made with yeast, but for seven days eat unleavened bread, the bread of affliction, because you left Egypt in haste--so that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from Egypt.
05Dt 16:4 Let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days. Do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning.
05Dt 16:5 You must not sacrifice the Passover in any town the LORD your God gives you
05Dt 16:6 except in the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name. There you must sacrifice the Passover in the evening, when the sun goes down, on the anniversary of your departure from Egypt.
05Dt 16:7 Roast it and eat it at the place the LORD your God will choose. Then in the morning return to your tents.
05Dt 16:8 For six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly to the LORD your God and do no work.
05Dt 16:9 Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain.
05Dt 16:10 Then celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 16:11 And rejoice before the LORD your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name--you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, the Levites in your towns, and the aliens, the fatherless and the widows living among you.
05Dt 16:12 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow carefully these decrees.
05Dt 16:13 Celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress.
05Dt 16:14 Be joyful at your Feast--you, your sons and daughters, your menservants and maidservants, and the Levites, the aliens, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns.
05Dt 16:15 For seven days celebrate the Feast to the LORD your God at the place the LORD will choose. For the LORD your God will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete.
05Dt 16:16 Three times a year all your men must appear before the LORD your God at the place he will choose£º at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Tabernacles. No man should appear before the LORD empty-handed£º
05Dt 16:17 Each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the LORD your God has blessed you.
05Dt 16:18 Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the LORD your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly.
05Dt 16:19 Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.
05Dt 16:20 Follow justice and justice alone, so that you may live and possess the land the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 16:21 Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build to the LORD your God,
05Dt 16:22 and do not erect a sacred stone, for these the LORD your God hates.
05Dt 17:1 Do not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or a sheep that has any defect or flaw in it, for that would be detestable to him.
05Dt 17:2 If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the LORD gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the LORD your God in violation of his covenant,
05Dt 17:3 and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods, bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars of the sky,
05Dt 17:4 and this has been brought to your attention, then you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in Israel,
05Dt 17:5 take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death.
05Dt 17:6 On the testimony of two or three witnesses a man shall be put to death, but no one shall be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
05Dt 17:7 The hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting him to death, and then the hands of all the people. You must purge the evil from among you.
05Dt 17:8 If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge--whether bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults--take them to the place the LORD your God will choose.
05Dt 17:9 Go to the priests, who are Levites, and to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict.
05Dt 17:10 You must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the LORD will choose. Be careful to do everything they direct you to do.
05Dt 17:11 Act according to the law they teach you and the decisions they give you. Do not turn aside from what they tell you, to the right or to the left.
05Dt 17:12 The man who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the LORD your God must be put to death. You must purge the evil from Israel.
05Dt 17:13 All the people will hear and be afraid, and will not be contemptuous again.
05Dt 17:14 When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it, and you say, "Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us,"
05Dt 17:15 be sure to appoint over you the king the LORD your God chooses. He must be from among your own brothers. Do not place a foreigner over you, one who is not a brother Israelite.
05Dt 17:16 The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them, for the LORD has told you, "You are not to go back that way again."
05Dt 17:17 He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.
05Dt 17:18 When he takes the throne of his kingdom, he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law, taken from that of the priests, who are Levites.
05Dt 17:19 It is to be with him, and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the LORD his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees
05Dt 17:20 and not consider himself better than his brothers and turn from the law to the right or to the left. Then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in Israel.
05Dt 18:1 The priests, who are Levites--indeed the whole tribe of Levi--are to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the offerings made to the LORD by fire, for that is their inheritance.
05Dt 18:2 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers; the LORD is their inheritance, as he promised them.
05Dt 18:3 This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep£º the shoulder, the jowls and the inner parts.
05Dt 18:4 You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep,
05Dt 18:5 for the LORD your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the LORD'S name always.
05Dt 18:6 If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the LORD will choose,
05Dt 18:7 he may minister in the name of the LORD his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the LORD.
05Dt 18:8 He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions.
05Dt 18:9 When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there.
05Dt 18:10 Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft,
05Dt 18:11 or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead.
05Dt 18:12 Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD, and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you.
05Dt 18:13 You must be blameless before the LORD your God.
05Dt 18:14 The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the LORD your God has not permitted you to do so.
05Dt 18:15 The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers. You must listen to him.
05Dt 18:16 For this is what you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, "Let us not hear the voice of the LORD our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die."
05Dt 18:17 The LORD said to me£º "What they say is good.
05Dt 18:18 I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers; I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell them everything I command him.
05Dt 18:19 If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will call him to account.
05Dt 18:20 But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded him to say, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, must be put to death."
05Dt 18:21 You may say to yourselves, "How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?"
05Dt 18:22 If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him.
05Dt 19:1 When the LORD your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses,
05Dt 19:2 then set aside for yourselves three cities centrally located in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
05Dt 19:3 Build roads to them and divide into three parts the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that anyone who kills a man may flee there.
05Dt 19:4 This is the rule concerning the man who kills another and flees there to save his life--one who kills his neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought.
05Dt 19:5 For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life.
05Dt 19:6 Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought.
05Dt 19:7 This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities.
05Dt 19:8 If the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to your forefathers, and gives you the whole land he promised them,
05Dt 19:9 because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today--to love the LORD your God and to walk always in his ways--then you are to set aside three more cities.
05Dt 19:10 Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.
05Dt 19:11 But if a man hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him, assaults and kills him, and then flees to one of these cities,
05Dt 19:12 the elders of his town shall send for him, bring him back from the city, and hand him over to the avenger of blood to die.
05Dt 19:13 Show him no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you.
05Dt 19:14 Do not move your neighbor's boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess.
05Dt 19:15 One witness is not enough to convict a man accused of any crime or offense he may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
05Dt 19:16 If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse a man of a crime,
05Dt 19:17 the two men involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the LORD before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time.
05Dt 19:18 The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against his brother,
05Dt 19:19 then do to him as he intended to do to his brother. You must purge the evil from among you.
05Dt 19:20 The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you.
05Dt 19:21 Show no pity£º life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
05Dt 20:1 When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours, do not be afraid of them, because the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, will be with you.
05Dt 20:2 When you are about to go into battle, the priest shall come forward and address the army.
05Dt 20:3 He shall say£º "Hear, O Israel, today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not be terrified or give way to panic before them.
05Dt 20:4 For the LORD your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory."
05Dt 20:5 The officers shall say to the army£º "Has anyone built a new house and not dedicated it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else may dedicate it.
05Dt 20:6 Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it.
05Dt 20:7 Has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her? Let him go home, or he may die in battle and someone else marry her."
05Dt 20:8 Then the officers shall add, "Is any man afraid or fainthearted? Let him go home so that his brothers will not become disheartened too."
05Dt 20:9 When the officers have finished speaking to the army, they shall appoint commanders over it.
05Dt 20:10 When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace.
05Dt 20:11 If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you.
05Dt 20:12 If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city.
05Dt 20:13 When the LORD your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it.
05Dt 20:14 As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the LORD your God gives you from your enemies.
05Dt 20:15 This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.
05Dt 20:16 However, in the cities of the nations the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes.
05Dt 20:17 Completely destroy them--the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites--as the LORD your God has commanded you.
05Dt 20:18 Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods, and you will sin against the LORD your God.
05Dt 20:19 When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are the trees of the field people, that you should besiege them?
05Dt 20:20 However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls.
05Dt 21:1 If a man is found slain, lying in a field in the land the LORD your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who killed him,
05Dt 21:2 your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns.
05Dt 21:3 Then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has never worn a yoke
05Dt 21:4 and lead her down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is a flowing stream. There in the valley they are to break the heifer's neck.
05Dt 21:5 The priests, the sons of Levi, shall step forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the LORD and to decide all cases of dispute and assault.
05Dt 21:6 Then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,
05Dt 21:7 and they shall declare£º "Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done.
05Dt 21:8 Accept this atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, O LORD, and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent man." And the bloodshed will be atoned for.
05Dt 21:9 So you will purge from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the LORD.
05Dt 21:10 When you go to war against your enemies and the LORD your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives,
05Dt 21:11 if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife.
05Dt 21:12 Bring her into your home and have her shave her head, trim her nails
05Dt 21:13 and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured. After she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month, then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife.
05Dt 21:14 If you are not pleased with her, let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have dishonored her.
05Dt 21:15 If a man has two wives, and he loves one but not the other, and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love,
05Dt 21:16 when he wills his property to his sons, he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn, the son of the wife he does not love.
05Dt 21:17 He must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has. That son is the first sign of his father's strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.
05Dt 21:18 If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him,
05Dt 21:19 his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town.
05Dt 21:20 They shall say to the elders, "This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard."
05Dt 21:21 Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.
05Dt 21:22 If a man guilty of a capital offense is put to death and his body is hung on a tree,
05Dt 21:23 you must not leave his body on the tree overnight. Be sure to bury him that same day, because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God's curse. You must not desecrate the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
05Dt 22:1 If you see your brother's ox or sheep straying, do not ignore it but be sure to take it back to him.
05Dt 22:2 If the brother does not live near you or if you do not know who he is, take it home with you and keep it until he comes looking for it. Then give it back to him.
05Dt 22:3 Do the same if you find your brother's donkey or his cloak or anything he loses. Do not ignore it.
05Dt 22:4 If you see your brother's donkey or his ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it. Help him get it to its feet.
05Dt 22:5 A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for the LORD your God detests anyone who does this.
05Dt 22:6 If you come across a bird's nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young.
05Dt 22:7 You may take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life.
05Dt 22:8 When you build a new house, make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof.
05Dt 22:9 Do not plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard; if you do, not only the crops you plant but also the fruit of the vineyard will be defiled.
05Dt 22:10 Do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together.
05Dt 22:11 Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together.
05Dt 22:12 Make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear.
05Dt 22:13 If a man takes a wife and, after lying with her, dislikes her
05Dt 22:14 and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, "I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,"
05Dt 22:15 then the girl's father and mother shall bring proof that she was a virgin to the town elders at the gate.
05Dt 22:16 The girl's father will say to the elders, "I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her.
05Dt 22:17 Now he has slandered her and said, 'I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.' But here is the proof of my daughter's virginity." Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town,
05Dt 22:18 and the elders shall take the man and punish him.
05Dt 22:19 They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the girl's father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives.
05Dt 22:20 If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the girl's virginity can be found,
05Dt 22:21 she shall be brought to the door of her father's house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father's house. You must purge the evil from among you.
05Dt 22:22 If a man is found sleeping with another man's wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.
05Dt 22:23 If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her,
05Dt 22:24 you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death--the girl because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man's wife. You must purge the evil from among you.
05Dt 22:25 But if out in the country a man happens to meet a girl pledged to be married and rapes her, only the man who has done this shall die.
05Dt 22:26 Do nothing to the girl; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like that of someone who attacks and murders his neighbor,
05Dt 22:27 for the man found the girl out in the country, and though the betrothed girl screamed, there was no one to rescue her.
05Dt 22:28 If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered,
05Dt 22:29 he shall pay the girl's father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the girl, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.
05Dt 22:30 A man is not to marry his father's wife; he must not dishonor his father's bed.
05Dt 23:1 No one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the LORD.
05Dt 23:2 No one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, even down to the tenth generation.
05Dt 23:3 No Ammonite or Moabite or any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the LORD, even down to the tenth generation.
05Dt 23:4 For they did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram Naharaim to pronounce a curse on you.
05Dt 23:5 However, the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam but turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loves you.
05Dt 23:6 Do not seek a treaty of friendship with them as long as you live.
05Dt 23:7 Do not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother. Do not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as an alien in his country.
05Dt 23:8 The third generation of children born to them may enter the assembly of the LORD.
05Dt 23:9 When you are encamped against your enemies, keep away from everything impure.
05Dt 23:10 If one of your men is unclean because of a nocturnal emission, he is to go outside the camp and stay there.
05Dt 23:11 But as evening approaches he is to wash himself, and at sunset he may return to the camp.
05Dt 23:12 Designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself.
05Dt 23:13 As part of your equipment have something to dig with, and when you relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up your excrement.
05Dt 23:14 For the LORD your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you.
05Dt 23:15 If a slave has taken refuge with you, do not hand him over to his master.
05Dt 23:16 Let him live among you wherever he likes and in whatever town he chooses. Do not oppress him.
05Dt 23:17 No Israelite man or woman is to become a shrine prostitute.
05Dt 23:18 You must not bring the earnings of a female prostitute or of a male prostitute into the house of the LORD your God to pay any vow, because the LORD your God detests them both.
05Dt 23:19 Do not charge your brother interest, whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest.
05Dt 23:20 You may charge a foreigner interest, but not a brother Israelite, so that the LORD your God may bless you in everything you put your hand to in the land you are entering to possess.
05Dt 23:21 If you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not be slow to pay it, for the LORD your God will certainly demand it of you and you will be guilty of sin.
05Dt 23:22 But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty.
05Dt 23:23 Whatever your lips utter you must be sure to do, because you made your vow freely to the LORD your God with your own mouth.
05Dt 23:24 If you enter your neighbor's vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but do not put any in your basket.
05Dt 23:25 If you enter your neighbor's grainfield, you may pick kernels with your hands, but you must not put a sickle to his standing grain.
05Dt 24:1 If a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her from his house,
05Dt 24:2 and if after she leaves his house she becomes the wife of another man,
05Dt 24:3 and her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, gives it to her and sends her from his house, or if he dies,
05Dt 24:4 then her first husband, who divorced her, is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled. That would be detestable in the eyes of the LORD. Do not bring sin upon the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.
05Dt 24:5 If a man has recently married, he must not be sent to war or have any other duty laid on him. For one year he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married.
05Dt 24:6 Do not take a pair of millstones--not even the upper one--as security for a debt, because that would be taking a man's livelihood as security.
05Dt 24:7 If a man is caught kidnapping one of his brother Israelites and treats him as a slave or sells him, the kidnapper must die. You must purge the evil from among you.
05Dt 24:8 In cases of leprous diseases be very careful to do exactly as the priests, who are Levites, instruct you. You must follow carefully what I have commanded them.
05Dt 24:9 Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam along the way after you came out of Egypt.
05Dt 24:10 When you make a loan of any kind to your neighbor, do not go into his house to get what he is offering as a pledge.
05Dt 24:11 Stay outside and let the man to whom you are making the loan bring the pledge out to you.
05Dt 24:12 If the man is poor, do not go to sleep with his pledge in your possession.
05Dt 24:13 Return his cloak to him by sunset so that he may sleep in it. Then he will thank you, and it will be regarded as a righteous act in the sight of the LORD your God.
05Dt 24:14 Do not take advantage of a hired man who is poor and needy, whether he is a brother Israelite or an alien living in one of your towns.
05Dt 24:15 Pay him his wages each day before sunset, because he is poor and is counting on it. Otherwise he may cry to the LORD against you, and you will be guilty of sin.
05Dt 24:16 Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their fathers; each is to die for his own sin.
05Dt 24:17 Do not deprive the alien or the fatherless of justice, or take the cloak of the widow as a pledge.
05Dt 24:18 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you from there. That is why I command you to do this.
05Dt 24:19 When you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf, do not go back to get it. Leave it for the alien, the fatherless and the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
05Dt 24:20 When you beat the olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow.
05Dt 24:21 When you harvest the grapes in your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the alien, the fatherless and the widow.
05Dt 24:22 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt. That is why I command you to do this.
05Dt 25:1 When men have a dispute, they are to take it to court and the judges will decide the case, acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty.
05Dt 25:2 If the guilty man deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make him lie down and have him flogged in his presence with the number of lashes his crime deserves,
05Dt 25:3 but he must not give him more than forty lashes. If he is flogged more than that, your brother will be degraded in your eyes.
05Dt 25:4 Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.
05Dt 25:5 If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son, his widow must not marry outside the family. Her husband's brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to her.
05Dt 25:6 The first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
05Dt 25:7 However, if a man does not want to marry his brother's wife, she shall go to the elders at the town gate and say, "My husband's brother refuses to carry on his brother's name in Israel. He will not fulfill the duty of a brother-in-law to me."
05Dt 25:8 Then the elders of his town shall summon him and talk to him. If he persists in saying, "I do not want to marry her,"
05Dt 25:9 his brother's widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders, take off one of his sandals, spit in his face and say, "This is what is done to the man who will not build up his brother's family line."
05Dt 25:10 That man's line shall be known in Israel as The Family of the Unsandaled.
05Dt 25:11 If two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts,
05Dt 25:12 you shall cut off her hand. Show her no pity.
05Dt 25:13 Do not have two differing weights in your bag--one heavy, one light.
05Dt 25:14 Do not have two differing measures in your house--one large, one small.
05Dt 25:15 You must have accurate and honest weights and measures, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 25:16 For the LORD your God detests anyone who does these things, anyone who deals dishonestly.
05Dt 25:17 Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of Egypt.
05Dt 25:18 When you were weary and worn out, they met you on your journey and cut off all who were lagging behind; they had no fear of God.
05Dt 25:19 When the LORD your God gives you rest from all the enemies around you in the land he is giving you to possess as an inheritance, you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven. Do not forget!
05Dt 26:1 When you have entered the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance and have taken possession of it and settled in it,
05Dt 26:2 take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the LORD your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name
05Dt 26:3 and say to the priest in office at the time, "I declare today to the LORD your God that I have come to the land the LORD swore to our forefathers to give us."
05Dt 26:4 The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the LORD your God.
05Dt 26:5 Then you shall declare before the LORD your God£º "My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation, powerful and numerous.
05Dt 26:6 But the Egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer, putting us to hard labor.
05Dt 26:7 Then we cried out to the LORD, the God of our fathers, and the LORD heard our voice and saw our misery, toil and oppression.
05Dt 26:8 So the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror and with miraculous signs and wonders.
05Dt 26:9 He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey;
05Dt 26:10 and now I bring the firstfruits of the soil that you, O LORD, have given me." Place the basket before the LORD your God and bow down before him.
05Dt 26:11 And you and the Levites and the aliens among you shall rejoice in all the good things the LORD your God has given to you and your household.
05Dt 26:12 When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, the alien, the fatherless and the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied.
05Dt 26:13 Then say to the LORD your God£º "I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the alien, the fatherless and the widow, according to all you commanded. I have not turned aside from your commands nor have I forgotten any of them.
05Dt 26:14 I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while I was in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor have I offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the LORD my God; I have done everything you commanded me.
05Dt 26:15 Look down from heaven, your holy dwelling place, and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us as you promised on oath to our forefathers, a land flowing with milk and honey."
05Dt 26:16 The LORD your God commands you this day to follow these decrees and laws; carefully observe them with all your heart and with all your soul.
05Dt 26:17 You have declared this day that the LORD is your God and that you will walk in his ways, that you will keep his decrees, commands and laws, and that you will obey him.
05Dt 26:18 And the LORD has declared this day that you are his people, his treasured possession as he promised, and that you are to keep all his commands.
05Dt 26:19 He has declared that he will set you in praise, fame and honor high above all the nations he has made and that you will be a people holy to the LORD your God, as he promised.
05Dt 27:1 Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people£º "Keep all these commands that I give you today.
05Dt 27:2 When you have crossed the Jordan into the land the LORD your God is giving you, set up some large stones and coat them with plaster.
05Dt 27:3 Write on them all the words of this law when you have crossed over to enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, promised you.
05Dt 27:4 And when you have crossed the Jordan, set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I command you today, and coat them with plaster.
05Dt 27:5 Build there an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones. Do not use any iron tool upon them.
05Dt 27:6 Build the altar of the LORD your God with fieldstones and offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God.
05Dt 27:7 Sacrifice fellowship offerings there, eating them and rejoicing in the presence of the LORD your God.
05Dt 27:8 And you shall write very clearly all the words of this law on these stones you have set up."
05Dt 27:9 Then Moses and the priests, who are Levites, said to all Israel, "Be silent, O Israel, and listen! You have now become the people of the LORD your God.
05Dt 27:10 Obey the LORD your God and follow his commands and decrees that I give you today."
05Dt 27:11 On the same day Moses commanded the people£º
05Dt 27:12 When you have crossed the Jordan, these tribes shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people£º Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin.
05Dt 27:13 And these tribes shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce curses£º Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan and Naphtali.
05Dt 27:14 The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud voice£º
05Dt 27:15 "Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol--a thing detestable to the LORD, the work of the craftsman's hands--and sets it up in secret." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:16 "Cursed is the man who dishonors his father or his mother." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:17 "Cursed is the man who moves his neighbor's boundary stone." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:18 "Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the road." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:19 "Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the fatherless or the widow." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:20 "Cursed is the man who sleeps with his father's wife, for he dishonors his father's bed." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:21 "Cursed is the man who has sexual relations with any animal." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:22 "Cursed is the man who sleeps with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:23 "Cursed is the man who sleeps with his mother-in-law." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:24 "Cursed is the man who kills his neighbor secretly." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:25 "Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 27:26 "Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of this law by carrying them out." Then all the people shall say, "Amen!"
05Dt 28:1 If you fully obey the LORD your God and carefully follow all his commands I give you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations on earth.
05Dt 28:2 All these blessings will come upon you and accompany you if you obey the LORD your God£º
05Dt 28:3 You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country.
05Dt 28:4 The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock--the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.
05Dt 28:5 Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed.
05Dt 28:6 You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out.
05Dt 28:7 The LORD will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you. They will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven.
05Dt 28:8 The LORD will send a blessing on your barns and on everything you put your hand to. The LORD your God will bless you in the land he is giving you.
05Dt 28:9 The LORD will establish you as his holy people, as he promised you on oath, if you keep the commands of the LORD your God and walk in his ways.
05Dt 28:10 Then all the peoples on earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will fear you.
05Dt 28:11 The LORD will grant you abundant prosperity--in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your ground--in the land he swore to your forefathers to give you.
05Dt 28:12 The LORD will open the heavens, the storehouse of his bounty, to send rain on your land in season and to bless all the work of your hands. You will lend to many nations but will borrow from none.
05Dt 28:13 The LORD will make you the head, not the tail. If you pay attention to the commands of the LORD your God that I give you this day and carefully follow them, you will always be at the top, never at the bottom.
05Dt 28:14 Do not turn aside from any of the commands I give you today, to the right or to the left, following other gods and serving them.
05Dt 28:15 However, if you do not obey the LORD your God and do not carefully follow all his commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come upon you and overtake you£º
05Dt 28:16 You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the country.
05Dt 28:17 Your basket and your kneading trough will be cursed.
05Dt 28:18 The fruit of your womb will be cursed, and the crops of your land, and the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.
05Dt 28:19 You will be cursed when you come in and cursed when you go out.
05Dt 28:20 The LORD will send on you curses, confusion and rebuke in everything you put your hand to, until you are destroyed and come to sudden ruin because of the evil you have done in forsaking him.
05Dt 28:21 The LORD will plague you with diseases until he has destroyed you from the land you are entering to possess.
05Dt 28:22 The LORD will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, with blight and mildew, which will plague you until you perish.
05Dt 28:23 The sky over your head will be bronze, the ground beneath you iron.
05Dt 28:24 The LORD will turn the rain of your country into dust and powder; it will come down from the skies until you are destroyed.
05Dt 28:25 The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies. You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven, and you will become a thing of horror to all the kingdoms on earth.
05Dt 28:26 Your carcasses will be food for all the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away.
05Dt 28:27 The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, festering sores and the itch, from which you cannot be cured.
05Dt 28:28 The LORD will afflict you with madness, blindness and confusion of mind.
05Dt 28:29 At midday you will grope about like a blind man in the dark. You will be unsuccessful in everything you do; day after day you will be oppressed and robbed, with no one to rescue you.
05Dt 28:30 You will be pledged to be married to a woman, but another will take her and ravish her. You will build a house, but you will not live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will not even begin to enjoy its fruit.
05Dt 28:31 Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will eat none of it. Your donkey will be forcibly taken from you and will not be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will rescue them.
05Dt 28:32 Your sons and daughters will be given to another nation, and you will wear out your eyes watching for them day after day, powerless to lift a hand.
05Dt 28:33 A people that you do not know will eat what your land and labor produce, and you will have nothing but cruel oppression all your days.
05Dt 28:34 The sights you see will drive you mad.
05Dt 28:35 The LORD will afflict your knees and legs with painful boils that cannot be cured, spreading from the soles of your feet to the top of your head.
05Dt 28:36 The LORD will drive you and the king you set over you to a nation unknown to you or your fathers. There you will worship other gods, gods of wood and stone.
05Dt 28:37 You will become a thing of horror and an object of scorn and ridicule to all the nations where the LORD will drive you.
05Dt 28:38 You will sow much seed in the field but you will harvest little, because locusts will devour it.
05Dt 28:39 You will plant vineyards and cultivate them but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because worms will eat them.
05Dt 28:40 You will have olive trees throughout your country but you will not use the oil, because the olives will drop off.
05Dt 28:41 You will have sons and daughters but you will not keep them, because they will go into captivity.
05Dt 28:42 Swarms of locusts will take over all your trees and the crops of your land.
05Dt 28:43 The alien who lives among you will rise above you higher and higher, but you will sink lower and lower.
05Dt 28:44 He will lend to you, but you will not lend to him. He will be the head, but you will be the tail.
05Dt 28:45 All these curses will come upon you. They will pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your God and observe the commands and decrees he gave you.
05Dt 28:46 They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever.
05Dt 28:47 Because you did not serve the LORD your God joyfully and gladly in the time of prosperity,
05Dt 28:48 therefore in hunger and thirst, in nakedness and dire poverty, you will serve the enemies the LORD sends against you. He will put an iron yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you.
05Dt 28:49 The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the ends of the earth, like an eagle swooping down, a nation whose language you will not understand,
05Dt 28:50 a fierce-looking nation without respect for the old or pity for the young.
05Dt 28:51 They will devour the young of your livestock and the crops of your land until you are destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine or oil, nor any calves of your herds or lambs of your flocks until you are ruined.
05Dt 28:52 They will lay siege to all the cities throughout your land until the high fortified walls in which you trust fall down. They will besiege all the cities throughout the land the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 28:53 Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege, you will eat the fruit of the womb, the flesh of the sons and daughters the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 28:54 Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children,
05Dt 28:55 and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating. It will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities.
05Dt 28:56 The most gentle and sensitive woman among you--so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot--will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter
05Dt 28:57 the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears. For she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy will inflict on you in your cities.
05Dt 28:58 If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name--the LORD your God--
05Dt 28:59 the LORD will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses.
05Dt 28:60 He will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they will cling to you.
05Dt 28:61 The LORD will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this Book of the Law, until you are destroyed.
05Dt 28:62 You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the LORD your God.
05Dt 28:63 Just as it pleased the LORD to make you prosper and increase in number, so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. You will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.
05Dt 28:64 Then the LORD will scatter you among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship other gods--gods of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.
05Dt 28:65 Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the LORD will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart.
05Dt 28:66 You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.
05Dt 28:67 In the morning you will say, "If only it were evening!" and in the evening, "If only it were morning!"--because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see.
05Dt 28:68 The LORD will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.
05Dt 29:1 These are the terms of the covenant the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb.
05Dt 29:2 Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them£º Your eyes have seen all that the LORD did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials and to all his land.
05Dt 29:3 With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those miraculous signs and great wonders.
05Dt 29:4 But to this day the LORD has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear.
05Dt 29:5 During the forty years that I led you through the desert, your clothes did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet.
05Dt 29:6 You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the LORD your God.
05Dt 29:7 When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them.
05Dt 29:8 We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
05Dt 29:9 Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do.
05Dt 29:10 All of you are standing today in the presence of the LORD your God--your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel,
05Dt 29:11 together with your children and your wives, and the aliens living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water.
05Dt 29:12 You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the LORD your God, a covenant the LORD is making with you this day and sealing with an oath,
05Dt 29:13 to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
05Dt 29:14 I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you
05Dt 29:15 who are standing here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God but also with those who are not here today.
05Dt 29:16 You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here.
05Dt 29:17 You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold.
05Dt 29:18 Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the LORD our God to go and worship the gods of those nations; make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison.
05Dt 29:19 When such a person hears the words of this oath, he invokes a blessing on himself and therefore thinks, "I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way." This will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.
05Dt 29:20 The LORD will never be willing to forgive him; his wrath and zeal will burn against that man. All the curses written in this book will fall upon him, and the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven.
05Dt 29:21 The LORD will single him out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.
05Dt 29:22 Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the LORD has afflicted it.
05Dt 29:23 The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur--nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in fierce anger.
05Dt 29:24 All the nations will ask£º "Why has the LORD done this to this land? Why this fierce, burning anger?"
05Dt 29:25 And the answer will be£º "It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt.
05Dt 29:26 They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them.
05Dt 29:27 Therefore the LORD'S anger burned against this land, so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book.
05Dt 29:28 In furious anger and in great wrath the LORD uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now."
05Dt 29:29 The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.
05Dt 30:1 When all these blessings and curses I have set before you come upon you and you take them to heart wherever the LORD your God disperses you among the nations,
05Dt 30:2 and when you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today,
05Dt 30:3 then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you.
05Dt 30:4 Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the LORD your God will gather you and bring you back.
05Dt 30:5 He will bring you to the land that belonged to your fathers, and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers.
05Dt 30:6 The LORD your God will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants, so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul, and live.
05Dt 30:7 The LORD your God will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you.
05Dt 30:8 You will again obey the LORD and follow all his commands I am giving you today.
05Dt 30:9 Then the LORD your God will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb, the young of your livestock and the crops of your land. The LORD will again delight in you and make you prosperous, just as he delighted in your fathers,
05Dt 30:10 if you obey the LORD your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this Book of the Law and turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
05Dt 30:11 Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach.
05Dt 30:12 It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, "Who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?"
05Dt 30:13 Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, "Who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?"
05Dt 30:14 No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.
05Dt 30:15 See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction.
05Dt 30:16 For I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and the LORD your God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess.
05Dt 30:17 But if your heart turns away and you are not obedient, and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them,
05Dt 30:18 I declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to enter and possess.
05Dt 30:19 This day I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live
05Dt 30:20 and that you may love the LORD your God, listen to his voice, and hold fast to him. For the LORD is your life, and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
05Dt 31:1 Then Moses went out and spoke these words to all Israel£º
05Dt 31:2 "I am now a hundred and twenty years old and I am no longer able to lead you. The LORD has said to me, 'You shall not cross the Jordan.'
05Dt 31:3 The LORD your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the LORD said.
05Dt 31:4 And the LORD will do to them what he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, whom he destroyed along with their land.
05Dt 31:5 The LORD will deliver them to you, and you must do to them all that I have commanded you.
05Dt 31:6 Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you."
05Dt 31:7 Then Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous, for you must go with this people into the land that the LORD swore to their forefathers to give them, and you must divide it among them as their inheritance.
05Dt 31:8 The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged."
05Dt 31:9 So Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.
05Dt 31:10 Then Moses commanded them£º "At the end of every seven years, in the year for canceling debts, during the Feast of Tabernacles,
05Dt 31:11 when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God at the place he will choose, you shall read this law before them in their hearing.
05Dt 31:12 Assemble the people--men, women and children, and the aliens living in your towns--so they can listen and learn to fear the LORD your God and follow carefully all the words of this law.
05Dt 31:13 Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the LORD your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess."
05Dt 31:14 The LORD said to Moses, "Now the day of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, where I will commission him." So Moses and Joshua came and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting.
05Dt 31:15 Then the LORD appeared at the Tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood over the entrance to the Tent.
05Dt 31:16 And the LORD said to Moses£º "You are going to rest with your fathers, and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake me and break the covenant I made with them.
05Dt 31:17 On that day I will become angry with them and forsake them; I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and difficulties will come upon them, and on that day they will ask, 'Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?'
05Dt 31:18 And I will certainly hide my face on that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods.
05Dt 31:19 "Now write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the Israelites and have them sing it, so that it may be a witness for me against them.
05Dt 31:20 When I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their forefathers, and when they eat their fill and thrive, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting me and breaking my covenant.
05Dt 31:21 And when many disasters and difficulties come upon them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are disposed to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath."
05Dt 31:22 So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.
05Dt 31:23 The LORD gave this command to Joshua son of Nun£º "Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I myself will be with you."
05Dt 31:24 After Moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end,
05Dt 31:25 he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD£º
05Dt 31:26 "Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God. There it will remain as a witness against you.
05Dt 31:27 For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the LORD while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!
05Dt 31:28 Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials, so that I can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to testify against them.
05Dt 31:29 For I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall upon you because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD and provoke him to anger by what your hands have made."
05Dt 31:30 And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel£º
05Dt 32:1 Listen, O heavens, and I will speak; hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
05Dt 32:2 Let my teaching fall like rain and my words descend like dew, like showers on new grass, like abundant rain on tender plants.
05Dt 32:3 I will proclaim the name of the LORD. Oh, praise the greatness of our God!
05Dt 32:4 He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just. A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he.
05Dt 32:5 They have acted corruptly toward him; to their shame they are no longer his children, but a warped and crooked generation.
05Dt 32:6 Is this the way you repay the LORD, O foolish and unwise people? Is he not your Father, your Creator, who made you and formed you?
05Dt 32:7 Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you.
05Dt 32:8 When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.
05Dt 32:9 For the LORD'S portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance.
05Dt 32:10 In a desert land he found him, in a barren and howling waste. He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye,
05Dt 32:11 like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions.
05Dt 32:12 The LORD alone led him; no foreign god was with him.
05Dt 32:13 He made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields. He nourished him with honey from the rock, and with oil from the flinty crag,
05Dt 32:14 with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats, with choice rams of Bashan and the finest kernels of wheat. You drank the foaming blood of the grape.
05Dt 32:15 Jeshurun grew fat and kicked; filled with food, he became heavy and sleek. He abandoned the God who made him and rejected the Rock his Savior.
05Dt 32:16 They made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols.
05Dt 32:17 They sacrificed to demons, which are not God--gods they had not known, gods that recently appeared, gods your fathers did not fear.
05Dt 32:18 You deserted the Rock, who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth.
05Dt 32:19 The LORD saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters.
05Dt 32:20 "I will hide my face from them," he said, "and see what their end will be; for they are a perverse generation, children who are unfaithful.
05Dt 32:21 They made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols. I will make them envious by those who are not a people; I will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding.
05Dt 32:22 For a fire has been kindled by my wrath, one that burns to the realm of death below. It will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains.
05Dt 32:23 "I will heap calamities upon them and spend my arrows against them.
05Dt 32:24 I will send wasting famine against them, consuming pestilence and deadly plague; I will send against them the fangs of wild beasts, the venom of vipers that glide in the dust.
05Dt 32:25 In the street the sword will make them childless; in their homes terror will reign. Young men and young women will perish, infants and gray-haired men.
05Dt 32:26 I said I would scatter them and blot out their memory from mankind,
05Dt 32:27 but I dreaded the taunt of the enemy, lest the adversary misunderstand and say, 'Our hand has triumphed; the LORD has not done all this.'"
05Dt 32:28 They are a nation without sense, there is no discernment in them.
05Dt 32:29 If only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be!
05Dt 32:30 How could one man chase a thousand, or two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up?
05Dt 32:31 For their rock is not like our Rock, as even our enemies concede.
05Dt 32:32 Their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are filled with poison, and their clusters with bitterness.
05Dt 32:33 Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras.
05Dt 32:34 "Have I not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults?
05Dt 32:35 It is mine to avenge; I will repay. In due time their foot will slip; their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them."
05Dt 32:36 The LORD will judge his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free.
05Dt 32:37 He will say£º "Now where are their gods, the rock they took refuge in,
05Dt 32:38 the gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up to help you! Let them give you shelter!
05Dt 32:39 "See now that I myself am He! There is no god besides me. I put to death and I bring to life, I have wounded and I will heal, and no one can deliver out of my hand.
05Dt 32:40 I lift my hand to heaven and declare£º As surely as I live forever,
05Dt 32:41 when I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me.
05Dt 32:42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood, while my sword devours flesh£º the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders."
05Dt 32:43 Rejoice, O nations, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people.
05Dt 32:44 Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people.
05Dt 32:45 When Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel,
05Dt 32:46 he said to them, "Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law.
05Dt 32:47 They are not just idle words for you--they are your life. By them you will live long in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess."
05Dt 32:48 On that same day the LORD told Moses,
05Dt 32:49 "Go up into the Abarim Range to Mount Nebo in Moab, across from Jericho, and view Canaan, the land I am giving the Israelites as their own possession.
05Dt 32:50 There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.
05Dt 32:51 This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites.
05Dt 32:52 Therefore, you will see the land only from a distance; you will not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel."
05Dt 33:1 This is the blessing that Moses the man of God pronounced on the Israelites before his death.
05Dt 33:2 He said£º "The LORD came from Sinai and dawned over them from Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran. He came with myriads of holy ones from the south, from his mountain slopes.
05Dt 33:3 Surely it is you who love the people; all the holy ones are in your hand. At your feet they all bow down, and from you receive instruction,
05Dt 33:4 the law that Moses gave us, the possession of the assembly of Jacob.
05Dt 33:5 He was king over Jeshurun when the leaders of the people assembled, along with the tribes of Israel.
05Dt 33:6 "Let Reuben live and not die, nor his men be few."
05Dt 33:7 And this he said about Judah£º "Hear, O LORD, the cry of Judah; bring him to his people. With his own hands he defends his cause. Oh, be his help against his foes!"
05Dt 33:8 About Levi he said£º "Your Thummim and Urim belong to the man you favored. You tested him at Massah; you contended with him at the waters of Meribah.
05Dt 33:9 He said of his father and mother, 'I have no regard for them.' He did not recognize his brothers or acknowledge his own children, but he watched over your word and guarded your covenant.
05Dt 33:10 He teaches your precepts to Jacob and your law to Israel. He offers incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
05Dt 33:11 Bless all his skills, O LORD, and be pleased with the work of his hands. Smite the loins of those who rise up against him; strike his foes till they rise no more."
05Dt 33:12 About Benjamin he said£º "Let the beloved of the LORD rest secure in him, for he shields him all day long, and the one the LORD loves rests between his shoulders."
05Dt 33:13 About Joseph he said£º "May the LORD bless his land with the precious dew from heaven above and with the deep waters that lie below;
05Dt 33:14 with the best the sun brings forth and the finest the moon can yield;
05Dt 33:15 with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills;
05Dt 33:16 with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness and the favor of him who dwelt in the burning bush. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
05Dt 33:17 In majesty he is like a firstborn bull; his horns are the horns of a wild ox. With them he will gore the nations, even those at the ends of the earth. Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim; such are the thousands of Manasseh."
05Dt 33:18 About Zebulun he said£º "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and you, Issachar, in your tents.
05Dt 33:19 They will summon peoples to the mountain and there offer sacrifices of righteousness; they will feast on the abundance of the seas, on the treasures hidden in the sand."
05Dt 33:20 About Gad he said£º "Blessed is he who enlarges Gad's domain! Gad lives there like a lion, tearing at arm or head.
05Dt 33:21 He chose the best land for himself; the leader's portion was kept for him. When the heads of the people assembled, he carried out the LORD'S righteous will, and his judgments concerning Israel."
05Dt 33:22 About Dan he said£º "Dan is a lion's cub, springing out of Bashan."
05Dt 33:23 About Naphtali he said£º "Naphtali is abounding with the favor of the LORD and is full of his blessing; he will inherit southward to the lake."
05Dt 33:24 About Asher he said£º "Most blessed of sons is Asher; let him be favored by his brothers, and let him bathe his feet in oil.
05Dt 33:25 The bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze, and your strength will equal your days.
05Dt 33:26 "There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens to help you and on the clouds in his majesty.
05Dt 33:27 The eternal God is your refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms. He will drive out your enemy before you, saying, 'Destroy him!'
05Dt 33:28 So Israel will live in safety alone; Jacob's spring is secure in a land of grain and new wine, where the heavens drop dew.
05Dt 33:29 Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD? He is your shield and helper and your glorious sword. Your enemies will cower before you, and you will trample down their high places."
05Dt 34:1 Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the LORD showed him the whole land--from Gilead to Dan,
05Dt 34:2 all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the western sea,
05Dt 34:3 the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar.
05Dt 34:4 Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it."
05Dt 34:5 And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab, as the LORD had said.
05Dt 34:6 He buried him in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is.
05Dt 34:7 Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone.
05Dt 34:8 The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over.
05Dt 34:9 Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD had commanded Moses.
05Dt 34:10 Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,
05Dt 34:11 who did all those miraculous signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt--to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land.
05Dt 34:12 For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.
06
06Jos 1:1 After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' aide£º
06Jos 1:2 "Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people, get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them--to the Israelites.
06Jos 1:3 I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.
06Jos 1:4 Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon, and from the great river, the Euphrates--all the Hittite country--to the Great Sea on the west.
06Jos 1:5 No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.
06Jos 1:6 "Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their forefathers to give them.
06Jos 1:7 Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the law my servant Moses gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, that you may be successful wherever you go.
06Jos 1:8 Do not let this Book of the Law depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful.
06Jos 1:9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be terrified; do not be discouraged, for the LORD your God will be with you wherever you go."
06Jos 1:10 So Joshua ordered the officers of the people£º
06Jos 1:11 "Go through the camp and tell the people, 'Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you for your own.'"
06Jos 1:12 But to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,
06Jos 1:13 "Remember the command that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you£º 'The LORD your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.'
06Jos 1:14 Your wives, your children and your livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, fully armed, must cross over ahead of your brothers. You are to help your brothers
06Jos 1:15 until the LORD gives them rest, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them. After that, you may go back and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise."
06Jos 1:16 Then they answered Joshua, "Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
06Jos 1:17 Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses.
06Jos 1:18 Whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words, whatever you may command them, will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!"
06Jos 2:1 Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. "Go, look over the land," he said, "especially Jericho." So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there.
06Jos 2:2 The king of Jericho was told, "Look! Some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land."
06Jos 2:3 So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab£º "Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land."
06Jos 2:4 But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, "Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from.
06Jos 2:5 At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don't know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them."
06Jos 2:6 (But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)
06Jos 2:7 So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.
06Jos 2:8 Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof
06Jos 2:9 and said to them, "I know that the LORD has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you.
06Jos 2:10 We have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.
06Jos 2:11 When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.
06Jos 2:12 Now then, please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign
06Jos 2:13 that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death."
06Jos 2:14 "Our lives for your lives!" the men assured her. "If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land."
06Jos 2:15 So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall.
06Jos 2:16 Now she had said to them, "Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way."
06Jos 2:17 The men said to her, "This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us
06Jos 2:18 unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house.
06Jos 2:19 If anyone goes outside your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head; we will not be responsible. As for anyone who is in the house with you, his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him.
06Jos 2:20 But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear."
06Jos 2:21 "Agreed," she replied. "Let it be as you say." So she sent them away and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window.
06Jos 2:22 When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.
06Jos 2:23 Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them.
06Jos 2:24 They said to Joshua, "The LORD has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us."
06Jos 3:1 Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over.
06Jos 3:2 After three days the officers went throughout the camp,
06Jos 3:3 giving orders to the people£º "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests, who are Levites, carrying it, you are to move out from your positions and follow it.
06Jos 3:4 Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But keep a distance of about a thousand yards between you and the ark; do not go near it."
06Jos 3:5 Joshua told the people, "Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing things among you."
06Jos 3:6 Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people." So they took it up and went ahead of them.
06Jos 3:7 And the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I was with Moses.
06Jos 3:8 Tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant£º 'When you reach the edge of the Jordan's waters, go and stand in the river.'"
06Jos 3:9 Joshua said to the Israelites, "Come here and listen to the words of the LORD your God.
06Jos 3:10 This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites.
06Jos 3:11 See, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go into the Jordan ahead of you.
06Jos 3:12 Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
06Jos 3:13 And as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the LORD--the Lord of all the earth--set foot in the Jordan, its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap."
06Jos 3:14 So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.
06Jos 3:15 Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water's edge,
06Jos 3:16 the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam in the vicinity of Zarethan, while the water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.
06Jos 3:17 The priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground.
06Jos 4:1 When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,
06Jos 4:2 "Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe,
06Jos 4:3 and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan from right where the priests stood and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight."
06Jos 4:4 So Joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the Israelites, one from each tribe,
06Jos 4:5 and said to them, "Go over before the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. Each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites,
06Jos 4:6 to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean?'
06Jos 4:7 tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever."
06Jos 4:8 So the Israelites did as Joshua commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, as the LORD had told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to their camp, where they put them down.
06Jos 4:9 Joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the Jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood. And they are there to this day.
06Jos 4:10 Now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything the LORD had commanded Joshua was done by the people, just as Moses had directed Joshua. The people hurried over,
06Jos 4:11 and as soon as all of them had crossed, the ark of the LORD and the priests came to the other side while the people watched.
06Jos 4:12 The men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, armed, in front of the Israelites, as Moses had directed them.
06Jos 4:13 About forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the LORD to the plains of Jericho for war.
06Jos 4:14 That day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they revered him all the days of his life, just as they had revered Moses.
06Jos 4:15 Then the LORD said to Joshua,
06Jos 4:16 "Command the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan."
06Jos 4:17 So Joshua commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."
06Jos 4:18 And the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD. No sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before.
06Jos 4:19 On the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.
06Jos 4:20 And Joshua set up at Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the Jordan.
06Jos 4:21 He said to the Israelites, "In the future when your descendants ask their fathers, 'What do these stones mean?'
06Jos 4:22 tell them, 'Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'
06Jos 4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the Jordan before you until you had crossed over. The LORD your God did to the Jordan just what he had done to the Red Sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over.
06Jos 4:24 He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the LORD is powerful and so that you might always fear the LORD your God."
06Jos 5:1 Now when all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the coast heard how the LORD had dried up the Jordan before the Israelites until we had crossed over, their hearts melted and they no longer had the courage to face the Israelites.
06Jos 5:2 At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again."
06Jos 5:3 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.
06Jos 5:4 Now this is why he did so£º All those who came out of Egypt--all the men of military age--died in the desert on the way after leaving Egypt.
06Jos 5:5 All the people that came out had been circumcised, but all the people born in the desert during the journey from Egypt had not.
06Jos 5:6 The Israelites had moved about in the desert forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left Egypt had died, since they had not obeyed the LORD. For the LORD had sworn to them that they would not see the land that he had solemnly promised their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.
06Jos 5:7 So he raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way.
06Jos 5:8 And after the whole nation had been circumcised, they remained where they were in camp until they were healed.
06Jos 5:9 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." So the place has been called Gilgal to this day.
06Jos 5:10 On the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, while camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites celebrated the Passover.
06Jos 5:11 The day after the Passover, that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land£º unleavened bread and roasted grain.
06Jos 5:12 The manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, but that year they ate of the produce of Canaan.
06Jos 5:13 Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua went up to him and asked, "Are you for us or for our enemies?"
06Jos 5:14 "Neither," he replied, "but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come." Then Joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence, and asked him, "What message does my Lord have for his servant?"
06Jos 5:15 The commander of the LORD'S army replied, "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did so.
06Jos 6:1 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in.
06Jos 6:2 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men.
06Jos 6:3 March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days.
06Jos 6:4 Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets.
06Jos 6:5 When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have all the people give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up, every man straight in."
06Jos 6:6 So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant of the LORD and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it."
06Jos 6:7 And he ordered the people, "Advance! March around the city, with the armed guard going ahead of the ark of the LORD."
06Jos 6:8 When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the LORD went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the LORD'S covenant followed them.
06Jos 6:9 The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding.
06Jos 6:10 But Joshua had commanded the people, "Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!"
06Jos 6:11 So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. Then the people returned to camp and spent the night there.
06Jos 6:12 Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.
06Jos 6:13 The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the LORD and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets kept sounding.
06Jos 6:14 So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
06Jos 6:15 On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times.
06Jos 6:16 The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the city!
06Jos 6:17 The city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent.
06Jos 6:18 But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it.
06Jos 6:19 All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the LORD and must go into his treasury."
06Jos 6:20 When the trumpets sounded, the people shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so every man charged straight in, and they took the city.
06Jos 6:21 They devoted the city to the LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it--men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys.
06Jos 6:22 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her."
06Jos 6:23 So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel.
06Jos 6:24 Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD'S house.
06Jos 6:25 But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho--and she lives among the Israelites to this day.
06Jos 6:26 At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath£º "Cursed before the LORD is the man who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho£º "At the cost of his firstborn son will he lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest will he set up its gates."
06Jos 6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land.
06Jos 7:1 But the Israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things; Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the LORD'S anger burned against Israel.
06Jos 7:2 Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, "Go up and spy out the region." So the men went up and spied out Ai.
06Jos 7:3 When they returned to Joshua, they said, "Not all the people will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary all the people, for only a few men are there."
06Jos 7:4 So about three thousand men went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai,
06Jos 7:5 who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted and became like water.
06Jos 7:6 Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the LORD, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads.
06Jos 7:7 And Joshua said, "Ah, Sovereign LORD, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!
06Jos 7:8 O Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies?
06Jos 7:9 The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?"
06Jos 7:10 The LORD said to Joshua, "Stand up! What are you doing down on your face?
06Jos 7:11 Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions.
06Jos 7:12 That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction.
06Jos 7:13 "Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º That which is devoted is among you, O Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove it.
06Jos 7:14 "'In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe that the LORD takes shall come forward clan by clan; the clan that the LORD takes shall come forward family by family; and the family that the LORD takes shall come forward man by man.
06Jos 7:15 He who is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the LORD and has done a disgraceful thing in Israel!'"
06Jos 7:16 Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was taken.
06Jos 7:17 The clans of Judah came forward, and he took the Zerahites. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was taken.
06Jos 7:18 Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
06Jos 7:19 Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give him the praise. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me."
06Jos 7:20 Achan replied, "It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel. This is what I have done£º
06Jos 7:21 When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath."
06Jos 7:22 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath.
06Jos 7:23 They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the LORD.
06Jos 7:24 Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold wedge, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor.
06Jos 7:25 Joshua said, "Why have you brought this trouble on us? The LORD will bring trouble on you today." Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.
06Jos 7:26 Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since.
06Jos 8:1 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Take the whole army with you, and go up and attack Ai. For I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city and his land.
06Jos 8:2 You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city."
06Jos 8:3 So Joshua and the whole army moved out to attack Ai. He chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night
06Jos 8:4 with these orders£º "Listen carefully. You are to set an ambush behind the city. Don't go very far from it. All of you be on the alert.
06Jos 8:5 I and all those with me will advance on the city, and when the men come out against us, as they did before, we will flee from them.
06Jos 8:6 They will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city, for they will say, 'They are running away from us as they did before.' So when we flee from them,
06Jos 8:7 you are to rise up from ambush and take the city. The LORD your God will give it into your hand.
06Jos 8:8 When you have taken the city, set it on fire. Do what the LORD has commanded. See to it; you have my orders."
06Jos 8:9 Then Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai--but Joshua spent that night with the people.
06Jos 8:10 Early the next morning Joshua mustered his men, and he and the leaders of Israel marched before them to Ai.
06Jos 8:11 The entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it. They set up camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the city.
06Jos 8:12 Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.
06Jos 8:13 They had the soldiers take up their positions--all those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. That night Joshua went into the valley.
06Jos 8:14 When the king of Ai saw this, he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet Israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the Arabah. But he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city.
06Jos 8:15 Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back before them, and they fled toward the desert.
06Jos 8:16 All the men of Ai were called to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city.
06Jos 8:17 Not a man remained in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel. They left the city open and went in pursuit of Israel.
06Jos 8:18 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Hold out toward Ai the javelin that is in your hand, for into your hand I will deliver the city." So Joshua held out his javelin toward Ai.
06Jos 8:19 As soon as he did this, the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward. They entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire.
06Jos 8:20 The men of Ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising against the sky, but they had no chance to escape in any direction, for the Israelites who had been fleeing toward the desert had turned back against their pursuers.
06Jos 8:21 For when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai.
06Jos 8:22 The men of the ambush also came out of the city against them, so that they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel cut them down, leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives.
06Jos 8:23 But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
06Jos 8:24 When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it.
06Jos 8:25 Twelve thousand men and women fell that day--all the people of Ai.
06Jos 8:26 For Joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in Ai.
06Jos 8:27 But Israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city, as the LORD had instructed Joshua.
06Jos 8:28 So Joshua burned Ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day.
06Jos 8:29 He hung the king of Ai on a tree and left him there until evening. At sunset, Joshua ordered them to take his body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate. And they raised a large pile of rocks over it, which remains to this day.
06Jos 8:30 Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel,
06Jos 8:31 as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the Israelites. He built it according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses--an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. On it they offered to the LORD burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings.
06Jos 8:32 There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua copied on stones the law of Moses, which he had written.
06Jos 8:33 All Israel, aliens and citizens alike, with their elders, officials and judges, were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the LORD, facing those who carried it--the priests, who were Levites. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of Israel.
06Jos 8:34 Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law--the blessings and the curses--just as it is written in the Book of the Law.
06Jos 8:35 There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the aliens who lived among them.
06Jos 9:1 Now when all the kings west of the Jordan heard about these things--those in the hill country, in the western foothills, and along the entire coast of the Great Sea as far as Lebanon (the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)--
06Jos 9:2 they came together to make war against Joshua and Israel.
06Jos 9:3 However, when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
06Jos 9:4 they resorted to a ruse£º They went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and mended.
06Jos 9:5 The men put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes. All the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy.
06Jos 9:6 Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant country; make a treaty with us."
06Jos 9:7 The men of Israel said to the Hivites, "But perhaps you live near us. How then can we make a treaty with you?"
06Jos 9:8 "We are your servants," they said to Joshua. But Joshua asked, "Who are you and where do you come from?"
06Jos 9:9 They answered£º "Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the LORD your God. For we have heard reports of him£º all that he did in Egypt,
06Jos 9:10 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan--Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.
06Jos 9:11 And our elders and all those living in our country said to us, 'Take provisions for your journey; go and meet them and say to them, "We are your servants; make a treaty with us." '
06Jos 9:12 This bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you. But now see how dry and moldy it is.
06Jos 9:13 And these wineskins that we filled were new, but see how cracked they are. And our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey."
06Jos 9:14 The men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the LORD.
06Jos 9:15 Then Joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.
06Jos 9:16 Three days after they made the treaty with the Gibeonites, the Israelites heard that they were neighbors, living near them.
06Jos 9:17 So the Israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities£º Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim.
06Jos 9:18 But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. The whole assembly grumbled against the leaders,
06Jos 9:19 but all the leaders answered, "We have given them our oath by the LORD, the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them now.
06Jos 9:20 This is what we will do to them£º We will let them live, so that wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them."
06Jos 9:21 They continued, "Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community." So the leaders' promise to them was kept.
06Jos 9:22 Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, "Why did you deceive us by saying, 'We live a long way from you,' while actually you live near us?
06Jos 9:23 You are now under a curse£º You will never cease to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God."
06Jos 9:24 They answered Joshua, "Your servants were clearly told how the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you. So we feared for our lives because of you, and that is why we did this.
06Jos 9:25 We are now in your hands. Do to us whatever seems good and right to you."
06Jos 9:26 So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them.
06Jos 9:27 That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the LORD at the place the LORD would choose. And that is what they are to this day.
06Jos 10:1 Now Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai and totally destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the people of Gibeon had made a treaty of peace with Israel and were living near them.
06Jos 10:2 He and his people were very much alarmed at this, because Gibeon was an important city, like one of the royal cities; it was larger than Ai, and all its men were good fighters.
06Jos 10:3 So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem appealed to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish and Debir king of Eglon.
06Jos 10:4 "Come up and help me attack Gibeon," he said, "because it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites."
06Jos 10:5 Then the five kings of the Amorites--the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon--joined forces. They moved up with all their troops and took up positions against Gibeon and attacked it.
06Jos 10:6 The Gibeonites then sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal£º "Do not abandon your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us! Help us, because all the Amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us."
06Jos 10:7 So Joshua marched up from Gilgal with his entire army, including all the best fighting men.
06Jos 10:8 The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them; I have given them into your hand. Not one of them will be able to withstand you."
06Jos 10:9 After an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua took them by surprise.
06Jos 10:10 The LORD threw them into confusion before Israel, who defeated them in a great victory at Gibeon. Israel pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon and cut them down all the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
06Jos 10:11 As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites.
06Jos 10:12 On the day the LORD gave the Amorites over to Israel, Joshua said to the LORD in the presence of Israel£º "O sun, stand still over Gibeon, O moon, over the Valley of Aijalon."
06Jos 10:13 So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped, till the nation avenged itself on its enemies, as it is written in the Book of Jashar. The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day.
06Jos 10:14 There has never been a day like it before or since, a day when the LORD listened to a man. Surely the LORD was fighting for Israel!
06Jos 10:15 Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
06Jos 10:16 Now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah.
06Jos 10:17 When Joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah,
06Jos 10:18 he said, "Roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave, and post some men there to guard it.
06Jos 10:19 But don't stop! Pursue your enemies, attack them from the rear and don't let them reach their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand."
06Jos 10:20 So Joshua and the Israelites destroyed them completely--almost to a man--but the few who were left reached their fortified cities.
06Jos 10:21 The whole army then returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.
06Jos 10:22 Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me."
06Jos 10:23 So they brought the five kings out of the cave--the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon.
06Jos 10:24 When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he summoned all the men of Israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him, "Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came forward and placed their feet on their necks.
06Jos 10:25 Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged. Be strong and courageous. This is what the LORD will do to all the enemies you are going to fight."
06Jos 10:26 Then Joshua struck and killed the kings and hung them on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening.
06Jos 10:27 At sunset Joshua gave the order and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding. At the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks, which are there to this day.
06Jos 10:28 That day Joshua took Makkedah. He put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it. He left no survivors. And he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:29 Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it.
06Jos 10:30 The LORD also gave that city and its king into Israel's hand. The city and everyone in it Joshua put to the sword. He left no survivors there. And he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:31 Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish; he took up positions against it and attacked it.
06Jos 10:32 The LORD handed Lachish over to Israel, and Joshua took it on the second day. The city and everyone in it he put to the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.
06Jos 10:33 Meanwhile, Horam king of Gezer had come up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army--until no survivors were left.
06Jos 10:34 Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon; they took up positions against it and attacked it.
06Jos 10:35 They captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish.
06Jos 10:36 Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.
06Jos 10:37 They took the city and put it to the sword, together with its king, its villages and everyone in it. They left no survivors. Just as at Eglon, they totally destroyed it and everyone in it.
06Jos 10:38 Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned around and attacked Debir.
06Jos 10:39 They took the city, its king and its villages, and put them to the sword. Everyone in it they totally destroyed. They left no survivors. They did to Debir and its king as they had done to Libnah and its king and to Hebron.
06Jos 10:40 So Joshua subdued the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills and the mountain slopes, together with all their kings. He left no survivors. He totally destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded.
06Jos 10:41 Joshua subdued them from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and from the whole region of Goshen to Gibeon.
06Jos 10:42 All these kings and their lands Joshua conquered in one campaign, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
06Jos 10:43 Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
06Jos 11:1 When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Acshaph,
06Jos 11:2 and to the northern kings who were in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Kinnereth, in the western foothills and in Naphoth Dor on the west;
06Jos 11:3 to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites below Hermon in the region of Mizpah.
06Jos 11:4 They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots--a huge army, as numerous as the sand on the seashore.
06Jos 11:5 All these kings joined forces and made camp together at the Waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.
06Jos 11:6 The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them, because by this time tomorrow I will hand all of them over to Israel, slain. You are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots."
06Jos 11:7 So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them,
06Jos 11:8 and the LORD gave them into the hand of Israel. They defeated them and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon, to Misrephoth Maim, and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east, until no survivors were left.
06Jos 11:9 Joshua did to them as the LORD had directed£º He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots.
06Jos 11:10 At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword. (Hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms.)
06Jos 11:11 Everyone in it they put to the sword. They totally destroyed them, not sparing anything that breathed, and he burned up Hazor itself.
06Jos 11:12 Joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword. He totally destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded.
06Jos 11:13 Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds--except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
06Jos 11:14 The Israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone that breathed.
06Jos 11:15 As the LORD commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did it; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses.
06Jos 11:16 So Joshua took this entire land£º the hill country, all the Negev, the whole region of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah and the mountains of Israel with their foothills,
06Jos 11:17 from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and struck them down, putting them to death.
06Jos 11:18 Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time.
06Jos 11:19 Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon, not one city made a treaty of peace with the Israelites, who took them all in battle.
06Jos 11:20 For it was the LORD himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against Israel, so that he might destroy them totally, exterminating them without mercy, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
06Jos 11:21 At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country£º from Hebron, Debir and Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns.
06Jos 11:22 No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive.
06Jos 11:23 So Joshua took the entire land, just as the LORD had directed Moses, and he gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal divisions. Then the land had rest from war.
06Jos 12:1 These are the kings of the land whom the Israelites had defeated and whose territory they took over east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon, including all the eastern side of the Arabah£º
06Jos 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge--from the middle of the gorge--to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. This included half of Gilead.
06Jos 12:3 He also ruled over the eastern Arabah from the Sea of Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), to Beth Jeshimoth, and then southward below the slopes of Pisgah.
06Jos 12:4 And the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaites, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
06Jos 12:5 He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, all of Bashan to the border of the people of Geshur and Maacah, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
06Jos 12:6 Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites conquered them. And Moses the servant of the LORD gave their land to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh to be their possession.
06Jos 12:7 These are the kings of the land that Joshua and the Israelites conquered on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir (their lands Joshua gave as an inheritance to the tribes of Israel according to their tribal divisions--
06Jos 12:8 the hill country, the western foothills, the Arabah, the mountain slopes, the desert and the Negev--the lands of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites)£º
06Jos 12:9 the king of Jericho one the king of Ai (near Bethel) one
06Jos 12:10 the king of Jerusalem one the king of Hebron one
06Jos 12:11 the king of Jarmuth one the king of Lachish one
06Jos 12:12 the king of Eglon one the king of Gezer one
06Jos 12:13 the king of Debir one the king of Geder one
06Jos 12:14 the king of Hormah one the king of Arad one
06Jos 12:15 the king of Libnah one the king of Adullam one
06Jos 12:16 the king of Makkedah one the king of Bethel one
06Jos 12:17 the king of Tappuah one the king of Hepher one
06Jos 12:18 the king of Aphek one the king of Lasharon one
06Jos 12:19 the king of Madon one the king of Hazor one
06Jos 12:20 the king of Shimron Meron one the king of Acshaph one
06Jos 12:21 the king of Taanach one the king of Megiddo one
06Jos 12:22 the king of Kedesh one the king of Jokneam in Carmel one
06Jos 12:23 the king of Dor (in Naphoth Dor) one the king of Goyim in Gilgal one
06Jos 12:24 the king of Tirzah one thirty-one kings in all.
06Jos 13:1 When Joshua was old and well advanced in years, the LORD said to him, "You are very old, and there are still very large areas of land to be taken over.
06Jos 13:2 "This is the land that remains£º all the regions of the Philistines and Geshurites£º
06Jos 13:3 from the Shihor River on the east of Egypt to the territory of Ekron on the north, all of it counted as Canaanite (the territory of the five Philistine rulers in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron--that of the Avvites);
06Jos 13:4 from the south, all the land of the Canaanites, from Arah of the Sidonians as far as Aphek, the region of the Amorites,
06Jos 13:5 the area of the Gebalites; and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
06Jos 13:6 "As for all the inhabitants of the mountain regions from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, that is, all the Sidonians, I myself will drive them out before the Israelites. Be sure to allocate this land to Israel for an inheritance, as I have instructed you,
06Jos 13:7 and divide it as an inheritance among the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh."
06Jos 13:8 The other half of Manasseh, the Reubenites and the Gadites had received the inheritance that Moses had given them east of the Jordan, as he, the servant of the LORD, had assigned it to them.
06Jos 13:9 It extended from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and included the whole plateau of Medeba as far as Dibon,
06Jos 13:10 and all the towns of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, out to the border of the Ammonites.
06Jos 13:11 It also included Gilead, the territory of the people of Geshur and Maacah, all of Mount Hermon and all Bashan as far as Salecah--
06Jos 13:12 that is, the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei and had survived as one of the last of the Rephaites. Moses had defeated them and taken over their land.
06Jos 13:13 But the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maacah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day.
06Jos 13:14 But to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance, since the offerings made by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as he promised them.
06Jos 13:15 This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Reuben, clan by clan£º
06Jos 13:16 The territory from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the middle of the gorge, and the whole plateau past Medeba
06Jos 13:17 to Heshbon and all its towns on the plateau, including Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon,
06Jos 13:18 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
06Jos 13:19 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley,
06Jos 13:20 Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth
06Jos 13:21 --all the towns on the plateau and the entire realm of Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled at Heshbon. Moses had defeated him and the Midianite chiefs, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba--princes allied with Sihon--who lived in that country.
06Jos 13:22 In addition to those slain in battle, the Israelites had put to the sword Balaam son of Beor, who practiced divination.
06Jos 13:23 The boundary of the Reubenites was the bank of the Jordan. These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Reubenites, clan by clan.
06Jos 13:24 This is what Moses had given to the tribe of Gad, clan by clan£º
06Jos 13:25 The territory of Jazer, all the towns of Gilead and half the Ammonite country as far as Aroer, near Rabbah;
06Jos 13:26 and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir;
06Jos 13:27 and in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth and Zaphon with the rest of the realm of Sihon king of Heshbon (the east side of the Jordan, the territory up to the end of the Sea of Kinnereth).
06Jos 13:28 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the Gadites, clan by clan.
06Jos 13:29 This is what Moses had given to the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, to half the family of the descendants of Manasseh, clan by clan£º
06Jos 13:30 The territory extending from Mahanaim and including all of Bashan, the entire realm of Og king of Bashan--all the settlements of Jair in Bashan, sixty towns,
06Jos 13:31 half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei (the royal cities of Og in Bashan). This was for the descendants of Makir son of Manasseh--for half of the sons of Makir, clan by clan.
06Jos 13:32 This is the inheritance Moses had given when he was in the plains of Moab across the Jordan east of Jericho.
06Jos 13:33 But to the tribe of Levi, Moses had given no inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as he promised them.
06Jos 14:1 Now these are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to them.
06Jos 14:2 Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
06Jos 14:3 Moses had granted the two-and-a-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest,
06Jos 14:4 for the sons of Joseph had become two tribes--Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.
06Jos 14:5 So the Israelites divided the land, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
06Jos 14:6 Now the men of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me.
06Jos 14:7 I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions,
06Jos 14:8 but my brothers who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear. I, however, followed the LORD my God wholeheartedly.
06Jos 14:9 So on that day Moses swore to me, 'The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the LORD my God wholeheartedly.'
06Jos 14:10 "Now then, just as the LORD promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the desert. So here I am today, eighty-five years old!
06Jos 14:11 I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I'm just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then.
06Jos 14:12 Now give me this hill country that the LORD promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the LORD helping me, I will drive them out just as he said."
06Jos 14:13 Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.
06Jos 14:14 So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the LORD, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly.
06Jos 14:15 (Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the greatest man among the Anakites.) Then the land had rest from war.
06Jos 15:1 The allotment for the tribe of Judah, clan by clan, extended down to the territory of Edom, to the Desert of Zin in the extreme south.
06Jos 15:2 Their southern boundary started from the bay at the southern end of the Salt Sea,
06Jos 15:3 crossed south of Scorpion Pass, continued on to Zin and went over to the south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it ran past Hezron up to Addar and curved around to Karka.
06Jos 15:4 It then passed along to Azmon and joined the Wadi of Egypt, ending at the sea. This is their southern boundary.
06Jos 15:5 The eastern boundary is the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern boundary started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan,
06Jos 15:6 went up to Beth Hoglah and continued north of Beth Arabah to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
06Jos 15:7 The boundary then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and turned north to Gilgal, which faces the Pass of Adummim south of the gorge. It continued along to the waters of En Shemesh and came out at En Rogel.
06Jos 15:8 Then it ran up the Valley of Ben Hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). From there it climbed to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.
06Jos 15:9 From the hilltop the boundary headed toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, came out at the towns of Mount Ephron and went down toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim).
06Jos 15:10 Then it curved westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Kesalon), continued down to Beth Shemesh and crossed to Timnah.
06Jos 15:11 It went to the northern slope of Ekron, turned toward Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah and reached Jabneel. The boundary ended at the sea.
06Jos 15:12 The western boundary is the coastline of the Great Sea. These are the boundaries around the people of Judah by their clans.
06Jos 15:13 In accordance with the LORD'S command to him, Joshua gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion in Judah--Kiriath Arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.)
06Jos 15:14 From Hebron Caleb drove out the three Anakites--Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai--descendants of Anak.
06Jos 15:15 From there he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).
06Jos 15:16 And Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher."
06Jos 15:17 Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
06Jos 15:18 One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What can I do for you?"
06Jos 15:19 She replied, "Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
06Jos 15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of Judah, clan by clan£º
06Jos 15:21 The southernmost towns of the tribe of Judah in the Negev toward the boundary of Edom were£º Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,

06Jos 15:47 Ashdod, its surrounding settlements and villages; and Gaza, its settlements and villages, as far as the Wadi of Egypt and the coastline of the Great Sea.
06Jos 15:48 In the hill country£º Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
06Jos 15:49 Dannah, Kiriath Sannah (that is, Debir),
06Jos 15:50 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
06Jos 15:51 Goshen, Holon and Giloh--eleven towns and their villages.
06Jos 15:52 Arab, Dumah, Eshan,
06Jos 15:53 Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah,
06Jos 15:54 Humtah, Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) and Zior--nine towns and their villages.
06Jos 15:55 Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,
06Jos 15:56 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,
06Jos 15:57 Kain, Gibeah and Timnah--ten towns and their villages.
06Jos 15:58 Halhul, Beth Zur, Gedor,
06Jos 15:59 Maarath, Beth Anoth and Eltekon--six towns and their villages.
06Jos 15:60 Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim) and Rabbah--two towns and their villages.
06Jos 15:61 In the desert£º Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah,
06Jos 15:62 Nibshan, the City of Salt and En Gedi--six towns and their villages.
06Jos 15:63 Judah could not dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the people of Judah.
06Jos 16:1 The allotment for Joseph began at the Jordan of Jericho, east of the waters of Jericho, and went up from there through the desert into the hill country of Bethel.
06Jos 16:2 It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz), crossed over to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth,
06Jos 16:3 descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the sea.
06Jos 16:4 So Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance.
06Jos 16:5 This was the territory of Ephraim, clan by clan£º The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon
06Jos 16:6 and continued to the sea. From Micmethath on the north it curved eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it to Janoah on the east.
06Jos 16:7 Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.
06Jos 16:8 From Tappuah the border went west to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Ephraimites, clan by clan.
06Jos 16:9 It also included all the towns and their villages that were set aside for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites.
06Jos 16:10 They did not dislodge the Canaanites living in Gezer; to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are required to do forced labor.
06Jos 17:1 This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh as Joseph's firstborn, that is, for Makir, Manasseh's firstborn. Makir was the ancestor of the Gileadites, who had received Gilead and Bashan because the Makirites were great soldiers.
06Jos 17:2 So this allotment was for the rest of the people of Manasseh--the clans of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher and Shemida. These are the other male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.
06Jos 17:3 Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah.
06Jos 17:4 They went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers." So Joshua gave them an inheritance along with the brothers of their father, according to the LORD'S command.
06Jos 17:5 Manasseh's share consisted of ten tracts of land besides Gilead and Bashan east of the Jordan,
06Jos 17:6 because the daughters of the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance among the sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.
06Jos 17:7 The territory of Manasseh extended from Asher to Micmethath east of Shechem. The boundary ran southward from there to include the people living at En Tappuah.
06Jos 17:8 (Manasseh had the land of Tappuah, but Tappuah itself, on the boundary of Manasseh, belonged to the Ephraimites.)
06Jos 17:9 Then the boundary continued south to the Kanah Ravine. There were towns belonging to Ephraim lying among the towns of Manasseh, but the boundary of Manasseh was the northern side of the ravine and ended at the sea.
06Jos 17:10 On the south the land belonged to Ephraim, on the north to Manasseh. The territory of Manasseh reached the sea and bordered Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.
06Jos 17:11 Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh also had Beth Shan, Ibleam and the people of Dor, Endor, Taanach and Megiddo, together with their surrounding settlements (the third in the list is Naphoth).
06Jos 17:12 Yet the Manassites were not able to occupy these towns, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that region.
06Jos 17:13 However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely.
06Jos 17:14 The people of Joseph said to Joshua, "Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous people and the LORD has blessed us abundantly."
06Jos 17:15 "If you are so numerous," Joshua answered, "and if the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and Rephaites."
06Jos 17:16 The people of Joseph replied, "The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have iron chariots, both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel."
06Jos 17:17 But Joshua said to the house of Joseph--to Ephraim and Manasseh--"You are numerous and very powerful. You will have not only one allotment
06Jos 17:18 but the forested hill country as well. Clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours; though the Canaanites have iron chariots and though they are strong, you can drive them out."
06Jos 18:1 The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. The country was brought under their control,
06Jos 18:2 but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance.
06Jos 18:3 So Joshua said to the Israelites£º "How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?
06Jos 18:4 Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me.
06Jos 18:5 You are to divide the land into seven parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the house of Joseph in its territory on the north.
06Jos 18:6 After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the LORD our God.
06Jos 18:7 The Levites, however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly service of the LORD is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the LORD gave it to them."
06Jos 18:8 As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, "Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD."
06Jos 18:9 So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.
06Jos 18:10 Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD, and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions.
06Jos 18:11 The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph£º
06Jos 18:12 On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan, passed the northern slope of Jericho and headed west into the hill country, coming out at the desert of Beth Aven.
06Jos 18:13 From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.
06Jos 18:14 From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side.
06Jos 18:15 The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west, and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.
06Jos 18:16 The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and so to En Rogel.
06Jos 18:17 It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.
06Jos 18:18 It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah and on down into the Arabah.
06Jos 18:19 It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary.
06Jos 18:20 The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side. These were the boundaries that marked out the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides.
06Jos 18:21 The tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, had the following cities£º Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz,
06Jos 18:22 Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
06Jos 18:23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,
06Jos 18:24 Kephar Ammoni, Ophni and Geba--twelve towns and their villages.
06Jos 18:25 Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,
06Jos 18:26 Mizpah, Kephirah, Mozah,
06Jos 18:27 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,
06Jos 18:28 Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah and Kiriath--fourteen towns and their villages. This was the inheritance of Benjamin for its clans.
06Jos 19:1 The second lot came out for the tribe of Simeon, clan by clan. Their inheritance lay within the territory of Judah.
06Jos 19:2 It included£º Beersheba (or Sheba), Moladah,
06Jos 19:3 Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem,
06Jos 19:4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah,
06Jos 19:5 Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah,
06Jos 19:6 Beth Lebaoth and Sharuhen--thirteen towns and their villages;
06Jos 19:7 Ain, Rimmon, Ether and Ashan--four towns and their villages--
06Jos 19:8 and all the villages around these towns as far as Baalath Beer (Ramah in the Negev). This was the inheritance of the tribe of the Simeonites, clan by clan.
06Jos 19:9 The inheritance of the Simeonites was taken from the share of Judah, because Judah's portion was more than they needed. So the Simeonites received their inheritance within the territory of Judah.
06Jos 19:10 The third lot came up for Zebulun, clan by clan£º The boundary of their inheritance went as far as Sarid.
06Jos 19:11 Going west it ran to Maralah, touched Dabbesheth, and extended to the ravine near Jokneam.
06Jos 19:12 It turned east from Sarid toward the sunrise to the territory of Kisloth Tabor and went on to Daberath and up to Japhia.
06Jos 19:13 Then it continued eastward to Gath Hepher and Eth Kazin; it came out at Rimmon and turned toward Neah.
06Jos 19:14 There the boundary went around on the north to Hannathon and ended at the Valley of Iphtah El.
06Jos 19:15 Included were Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah and Bethlehem. There were twelve towns and their villages.
06Jos 19:16 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of Zebulun, clan by clan.
06Jos 19:17 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, clan by clan.
06Jos 19:18 Their territory included£º Jezreel, Kesulloth, Shunem,
06Jos 19:19 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,
06Jos 19:20 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez,
06Jos 19:21 Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah and Beth Pazzez.
06Jos 19:22 The boundary touched Tabor, Shahazumah and Beth Shemesh, and ended at the Jordan. There were sixteen towns and their villages.
06Jos 19:23 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar, clan by clan.
06Jos 19:24 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of Asher, clan by clan.
06Jos 19:25 Their territory included£º Helkath, Hali, Beten, Acshaph,
06Jos 19:26 Allammelech, Amad and Mishal. On the west the boundary touched Carmel and Shihor Libnath.
06Jos 19:27 It then turned east toward Beth Dagon, touched Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah El, and went north to Beth Emek and Neiel, passing Cabul on the left.
06Jos 19:28 It went to Abdon, Rehob, Hammon and Kanah, as far as Greater Sidon.
06Jos 19:29 The boundary then turned back toward Ramah and went to the fortified city of Tyre, turned toward Hosah and came out at the sea in the region of Aczib,
06Jos 19:30 Ummah, Aphek and Rehob. There were twenty-two towns and their villages.
06Jos 19:31 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Asher, clan by clan.
06Jos 19:32 The sixth lot came out for Naphtali, clan by clan£º
06Jos 19:33 Their boundary went from Heleph and the large tree in Zaanannim, passing Adami Nekeb and Jabneel to Lakkum and ending at the Jordan.
06Jos 19:34 The boundary ran west through Aznoth Tabor and came out at Hukkok. It touched Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west and the Jordan on the east.
06Jos 19:35 The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth,
06Jos 19:36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,
06Jos 19:37 Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor,
06Jos 19:38 Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath and Beth Shemesh. There were nineteen towns and their villages.
06Jos 19:39 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali, clan by clan.
06Jos 19:40 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of Dan, clan by clan.
06Jos 19:41 The territory of their inheritance included£º Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh,
06Jos 19:42 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah,
06Jos 19:43 Elon, Timnah, Ekron,
06Jos 19:44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath,
06Jos 19:45 Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon,
06Jos 19:46 Me Jarkon and Rakkon, with the area facing Joppa.
06Jos 19:47 (But the Danites had difficulty taking possession of their territory, so they went up and attacked Leshem, took it, put it to the sword and occupied it. They settled in Leshem and named it Dan after their forefather.)
06Jos 19:48 These towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of Dan, clan by clan.
06Jos 19:49 When they had finished dividing the land into its allotted portions, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them,
06Jos 19:50 as the LORD had commanded. They gave him the town he asked for--Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim. And he built up the town and settled there.
06Jos 19:51 These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel assigned by lot at Shiloh in the presence of the LORD at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. And so they finished dividing the land.
06Jos 20:1 Then the LORD said to Joshua£º
06Jos 20:2 "Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses,
06Jos 20:3 so that anyone who kills a person accidentally and unintentionally may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood.
06Jos 20:4 "When he flees to one of these cities, he is to stand in the entrance of the city gate and state his case before the elders of that city. Then they are to admit him into their city and give him a place to live with them.
06Jos 20:5 If the avenger of blood pursues him, they must not surrender the one accused, because he killed his neighbor unintentionally and without malice aforethought.
06Jos 20:6 He is to stay in that city until he has stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then he may go back to his own home in the town from which he fled."
06Jos 20:7 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.
06Jos 20:8 On the east side of the Jordan of Jericho they designated Bezer in the desert on the plateau in the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead in the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan in the tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 20:9 Any of the Israelites or any alien living among them who killed someone accidentally could flee to these designated cities and not be killed by the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly.
06Jos 21:1 Now the family heads of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the other tribal families of Israel
06Jos 21:2 at Shiloh in Canaan and said to them, "The LORD commanded through Moses that you give us towns to live in, with pasturelands for our livestock."
06Jos 21:3 So, as the LORD had commanded, the Israelites gave the Levites the following towns and pasturelands out of their own inheritance£º
06Jos 21:4 The first lot came out for the Kohathites, clan by clan. The Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest were allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon and Benjamin.
06Jos 21:5 The rest of Kohath's descendants were allotted ten towns from the clans of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan and half of Manasseh.
06Jos 21:6 The descendants of Gershon were allotted thirteen towns from the clans of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
06Jos 21:7 The descendants of Merari, clan by clan, received twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Zebulun.
06Jos 21:8 So the Israelites allotted to the Levites these towns and their pasturelands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
06Jos 21:9 From the tribes of Judah and Simeon they allotted the following towns by name
06Jos 21:10 (these towns were assigned to the descendants of Aaron who were from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because the first lot fell to them)£º
06Jos 21:11 They gave them Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), with its surrounding pastureland, in the hill country of Judah. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.)
06Jos 21:12 But the fields and villages around the city they had given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
06Jos 21:13 So to the descendants of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Libnah,
06Jos 21:14 Jattir, Eshtemoa,
06Jos 21:15 Holon, Debir,
06Jos 21:16 Ain, Juttah and Beth Shemesh, together with their pasturelands--nine towns from these two tribes.
06Jos 21:17 And from the tribe of Benjamin they gave them Gibeon, Geba,
06Jos 21:18 Anathoth and Almon, together with their pasturelands--four towns.
06Jos 21:19 All the towns for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were thirteen, together with their pasturelands.
06Jos 21:20 The rest of the Kohathite clans of the Levites were allotted towns from the tribe of Ephraim£º
06Jos 21:21 In the hill country of Ephraim they were given Shechem (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Gezer,
06Jos 21:22 Kibzaim and Beth Horon, together with their pasturelands--four towns.
06Jos 21:23 Also from the tribe of Dan they received Eltekeh, Gibbethon,
06Jos 21:24 Aijalon and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands--four towns.
06Jos 21:25 From half the tribe of Manasseh they received Taanach and Gath Rimmon, together with their pasturelands--two towns.
06Jos 21:26 All these ten towns and their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clans.
06Jos 21:27 The Levite clans of the Gershonites were given£º from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for one accused of murder) and Be Eshtarah, together with their pasturelands--two towns;
06Jos 21:28 from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion, Daberath,
06Jos 21:29 Jarmuth and En Gannim, together with their pasturelands--four towns;
06Jos 21:30 from the tribe of Asher, Mishal, Abdon,
06Jos 21:31 Helkath and Rehob, together with their pasturelands--four towns;
06Jos 21:32 from the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Hammoth Dor and Kartan, together with their pasturelands--three towns.
06Jos 21:33 All the towns of the Gershonite clans were thirteen, together with their pasturelands.
06Jos 21:34 The Merarite clans (the rest of the Levites) were given£º from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam, Kartah,
06Jos 21:35 Dimnah and Nahalal, together with their pasturelands--four towns;
06Jos 21:36 from the tribe of Reuben, Bezer, Jahaz,
06Jos 21:37 Kedemoth and Mephaath, together with their pasturelands--four towns;
06Jos 21:38 from the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for one accused of murder), Mahanaim,
06Jos 21:39 Heshbon and Jazer, together with their pasturelands--four towns in all.
06Jos 21:40 All the towns allotted to the Merarite clans, who were the rest of the Levites, were twelve.
06Jos 21:41 The towns of the Levites in the territory held by the Israelites were forty-eight in all, together with their pasturelands.
06Jos 21:42 Each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it; this was true for all these towns.
06Jos 21:43 So the LORD gave Israel all the land he had sworn to give their forefathers, and they took possession of it and settled there.
06Jos 21:44 The LORD gave them rest on every side, just as he had sworn to their forefathers. Not one of their enemies withstood them; the LORD handed all their enemies over to them.
06Jos 21:45 Not one of all the LORD'S good promises to the house of Israel failed; every one was fulfilled.
06Jos 22:1 Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh
06Jos 22:2 and said to them, "You have done all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and you have obeyed me in everything I commanded.
06Jos 22:3 For a long time now--to this very day--you have not deserted your brothers but have carried out the mission the LORD your God gave you.
06Jos 22:4 Now that the LORD your God has given your brothers rest as he promised, return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan.
06Jos 22:5 But be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that Moses the servant of the LORD gave you£º to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, to obey his commands, to hold fast to him and to serve him with all your heart and all your soul."
06Jos 22:6 Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their homes.
06Jos 22:7 (To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half of the tribe Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan with their brothers.) When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them,
06Jos 22:8 saying, "Return to your homes with your great wealth--with large herds of livestock, with silver, gold, bronze and iron, and a great quantity of clothing--and divide with your brothers the plunder from your enemies."
06Jos 22:9 So the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead, their own land, which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the LORD through Moses.
06Jos 22:10 When they came to Geliloth near the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.
06Jos 22:11 And when the Israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan on the Israelite side,
06Jos 22:12 the whole assembly of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.
06Jos 22:13 So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead--to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 22:14 With him they sent ten of the chief men, one for each of the tribes of Israel, each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans.
06Jos 22:15 When they went to Gilead--to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh--they said to them£º
06Jos 22:16 "The whole assembly of the LORD says£º 'How could you break faith with the God of Israel like this? How could you turn away from the LORD and build yourselves an altar in rebellion against him now?
06Jos 22:17 Was not the sin of Peor enough for us? Up to this very day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin, even though a plague fell on the community of the LORD!
06Jos 22:18 And are you now turning away from the LORD? "'If you rebel against the LORD today, tomorrow he will be angry with the whole community of Israel.
06Jos 22:19 If the land you possess is defiled, come over to the LORD'S land, where the LORD'S tabernacle stands, and share the land with us. But do not rebel against the LORD or against us by building an altar for yourselves, other than the altar of the LORD our God.
06Jos 22:20 When Achan son of Zerah acted unfaithfully regarding the devoted things, did not wrath come upon the whole community of Israel? He was not the only one who died for his sin.'"
06Jos 22:21 Then Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh replied to the heads of the clans of Israel£º
06Jos 22:22 "The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows! And let Israel know! If this has been in rebellion or disobedience to the LORD, do not spare us this day.
06Jos 22:23 If we have built our own altar to turn away from the LORD and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it, may the LORD himself call us to account.
06Jos 22:24 "No! We did it for fear that some day your descendants might say to ours, 'What do you have to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?
06Jos 22:25 The LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you--you Reubenites and Gadites! You have no share in the LORD.' So your descendants might cause ours to stop fearing the LORD.
06Jos 22:26 "That is why we said, 'Let us get ready and build an altar--but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.'
06Jos 22:27 On the contrary, it is to be a witness between us and you and the generations that follow, that we will worship the LORD at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings, sacrifices and fellowship offerings. Then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to ours, 'You have no share in the LORD.'
06Jos 22:28 "And we said, 'If they ever say this to us, or to our descendants, we will answer£º Look at the replica of the LORD'S altar, which our fathers built, not for burnt offerings and sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.'
06Jos 22:29 "Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD and turn away from him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings and sacrifices, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle."
06Jos 22:30 When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community--the heads of the clans of the Israelites--heard what Reuben, Gad and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased.
06Jos 22:31 And Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, said to Reuben, Gad and Manasseh, "Today we know that the LORD is with us, because you have not acted unfaithfully toward the LORD in this matter. Now you have rescued the Israelites from the LORD'S hand."
06Jos 22:32 Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders returned to Canaan from their meeting with the Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and reported to the Israelites.
06Jos 22:33 They were glad to hear the report and praised God. And they talked no more about going to war against them to devastate the country where the Reubenites and the Gadites lived.
06Jos 22:34 And the Reubenites and the Gadites gave the altar this name£º A Witness Between Us that the LORD is God.
06Jos 23:1 After a long time had passed and the LORD had given Israel rest from all their enemies around them, Joshua, by then old and well advanced in years,
06Jos 23:2 summoned all Israel--their elders, leaders, judges and officials--and said to them£º "I am old and well advanced in years.
06Jos 23:3 You yourselves have seen everything the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake; it was the LORD your God who fought for you.
06Jos 23:4 Remember how I have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes all the land of the nations that remain--the nations I conquered--between the Jordan and the Great Sea in the west.
06Jos 23:5 The LORD your God himself will drive them out of your way. He will push them out before you, and you will take possession of their land, as the LORD your God promised you.
06Jos 23:6 "Be very strong; be careful to obey all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, without turning aside to the right or to the left.
06Jos 23:7 Do not associate with these nations that remain among you; do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them. You must not serve them or bow down to them.
06Jos 23:8 But you are to hold fast to the LORD your God, as you have until now.
06Jos 23:9 "The LORD has driven out before you great and powerful nations; to this day no one has been able to withstand you.
06Jos 23:10 One of you routs a thousand, because the LORD your God fights for you, just as he promised.
06Jos 23:11 So be very careful to love the LORD your God.
06Jos 23:12 "But if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them,
06Jos 23:13 then you may be sure that the LORD your God will no longer drive out these nations before you. Instead, they will become snares and traps for you, whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land, which the LORD your God has given you.
06Jos 23:14 "Now I am about to go the way of all the earth. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the LORD your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed.
06Jos 23:15 But just as every good promise of the LORD your God has come true, so the LORD will bring on you all the evil he has threatened, until he has destroyed you from this good land he has given you.
06Jos 23:16 If you violate the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, the LORD'S anger will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you."
06Jos 24:1 Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel, and they presented themselves before God.
06Jos 24:2 Joshua said to all the people, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º 'Long ago your forefathers, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the River and worshiped other gods.
06Jos 24:3 But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the River and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac,
06Jos 24:4 and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
06Jos 24:5 "'Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and I brought you out.
06Jos 24:6 When I brought your fathers out of Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red Sea.
06Jos 24:7 But they cried to the LORD for help, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians; he brought the sea over them and covered them. You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the desert for a long time.
06Jos 24:8 "'I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you, and you took possession of their land.
06Jos 24:9 When Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel, he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you.
06Jos 24:10 But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand.
06Jos 24:11 "'Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did also the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands.
06Jos 24:12 I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you--also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow.
06Jos 24:13 So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.'
06Jos 24:14 "Now fear the LORD and serve him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your forefathers worshiped beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.
06Jos 24:15 But if serving the LORD seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the LORD."
06Jos 24:16 Then the people answered, "Far be it from us to forsake the LORD to serve other gods!
06Jos 24:17 It was the LORD our God himself who brought us and our fathers up out of Egypt, from that land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled.
06Jos 24:18 And the LORD drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land. We too will serve the LORD, because he is our God."
06Jos 24:19 Joshua said to the people, "You are not able to serve the LORD. He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins.
06Jos 24:20 If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you."
06Jos 24:21 But the people said to Joshua, "No! We will serve the LORD."
06Jos 24:22 Then Joshua said, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the LORD." "Yes, we are witnesses," they replied.
06Jos 24:23 "Now then," said Joshua, "throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel."
06Jos 24:24 And the people said to Joshua, "We will serve the LORD our God and obey him."
06Jos 24:25 On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he drew up for them decrees and laws.
06Jos 24:26 And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the LORD.
06Jos 24:27 "See!" he said to all the people. "This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the LORD has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God."
06Jos 24:28 Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.
06Jos 24:29 After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.
06Jos 24:30 And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
06Jos 24:31 Israel served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the LORD had done for Israel.
06Jos 24:32 And Joseph's bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Joseph's descendants.
06Jos 24:33 And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
07
07Jdg 1:1 After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the LORD, "Who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the Canaanites?"
07Jdg 1:2 The LORD answered, "Judah is to go; I have given the land into their hands."
07Jdg 1:3 Then the men of Judah said to the Simeonites their brothers, "Come up with us into the territory allotted to us, to fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours." So the Simeonites went with them.
07Jdg 1:4 When Judah attacked, the LORD gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.
07Jdg 1:5 It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to rout the Canaanites and Perizzites.
07Jdg 1:6 Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
07Jdg 1:7 Then Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
07Jdg 1:8 The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and took it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.
07Jdg 1:9 After that, the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev and the western foothills.
07Jdg 1:10 They advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai.
07Jdg 1:11 From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).
07Jdg 1:12 And Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher."
07Jdg 1:13 Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to him in marriage.
07Jdg 1:14 One day when she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What can I do for you?"
07Jdg 1:15 She replied, "Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water." Then Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
07Jdg 1:16 The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went up from the City of Palms with the men of Judah to live among the people of the Desert of Judah in the Negev near Arad.
07Jdg 1:17 Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their brothers and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed the city. Therefore it was called Hormah.
07Jdg 1:18 The men of Judah also took Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron--each city with its territory.
07Jdg 1:19 The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had iron chariots.
07Jdg 1:20 As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove from it the three sons of Anak.
07Jdg 1:21 The Benjamites, however, failed to dislodge the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem; to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.
07Jdg 1:22 Now the house of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
07Jdg 1:23 When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz),
07Jdg 1:24 the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, "Show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well."
07Jdg 1:25 So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family.
07Jdg 1:26 He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and called it Luz, which is its name to this day.
07Jdg 1:27 But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.
07Jdg 1:28 When Israel became strong, they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely.
07Jdg 1:29 Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, but the Canaanites continued to live there among them.
07Jdg 1:30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, who remained among them; but they did subject them to forced labor.
07Jdg 1:31 Nor did Asher drive out those living in Acco or Sidon or Ahlab or Aczib or Helbah or Aphek or Rehob,
07Jdg 1:32 and because of this the people of Asher lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land.
07Jdg 1:33 Neither did Naphtali drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath; but the Naphtalites too lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land, and those living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced laborers for them.
07Jdg 1:34 The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain.
07Jdg 1:35 And the Amorites were determined also to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon and Shaalbim, but when the power of the house of Joseph increased, they too were pressed into forced labor.
07Jdg 1:36 The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond.
07Jdg 2:1 The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, "I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land that I swore to give to your forefathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you,
07Jdg 2:2 and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.' Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this?
07Jdg 2:3 Now therefore I tell you that I will not drive them out before you; they will be thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you."
07Jdg 2:4 When the angel of the LORD had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud,
07Jdg 2:5 and they called that place Bokim. There they offered sacrifices to the LORD.
07Jdg 2:6 After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance.
07Jdg 2:7 The people served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel.
07Jdg 2:8 Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.
07Jdg 2:9 And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
07Jdg 2:10 After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who knew neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel.
07Jdg 2:11 Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD and served the Baals.
07Jdg 2:12 They forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They provoked the LORD to anger
07Jdg 2:13 because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.
07Jdg 2:14 In his anger against Israel the LORD handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them to their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist.
07Jdg 2:15 Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the LORD was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress.
07Jdg 2:16 Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the hands of these raiders.
07Jdg 2:17 Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. Unlike their fathers, they quickly turned from the way in which their fathers had walked, the way of obedience to the LORD'S commands.
07Jdg 2:18 Whenever the LORD raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the LORD had compassion on them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them.
07Jdg 2:19 But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
07Jdg 2:20 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel and said, "Because this nation has violated the covenant that I laid down for their forefathers and has not listened to me,
07Jdg 2:21 I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.
07Jdg 2:22 I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the LORD and walk in it as their forefathers did."
07Jdg 2:23 The LORD had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua.
07Jdg 3:1 These are the nations the LORD left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan
07Jdg 3:2 (he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience)£º
07Jdg 3:3 the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
07Jdg 3:4 They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the LORD'S commands, which he had given their forefathers through Moses.
07Jdg 3:5 The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
07Jdg 3:6 They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
07Jdg 3:7 The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD; they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.
07Jdg 3:8 The anger of the LORD burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim, to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years.
07Jdg 3:9 But when they cried out to the LORD, he raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, who saved them.
07Jdg 3:10 The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, so that he became Israel's judge and went to war. The LORD gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel, who overpowered him.
07Jdg 3:11 So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.
07Jdg 3:12 Once again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and because they did this evil the LORD gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel.
07Jdg 3:13 Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms.
07Jdg 3:14 The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.
07Jdg 3:15 Again the Israelites cried out to the LORD, and he gave them a deliverer--Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab.
07Jdg 3:16 Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.
07Jdg 3:17 He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man.
07Jdg 3:18 After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way the men who had carried it.
07Jdg 3:19 At the idols near Gilgal he himself turned back and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." The king said, "Quiet!" And all his attendants left him.
07Jdg 3:20 Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his summer palace and said, "I have a message from God for you." As the king rose from his seat,
07Jdg 3:21 Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king's belly.
07Jdg 3:22 Even the handle sank in after the blade, which came out his back. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.
07Jdg 3:23 Then Ehud went out to the porch; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.
07Jdg 3:24 After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, "He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the house."
07Jdg 3:25 They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead.
07Jdg 3:26 While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the idols and escaped to Seirah.
07Jdg 3:27 When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.
07Jdg 3:28 "Follow me," he ordered, "for the LORD has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands." So they followed him down and, taking possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab, they allowed no one to cross over.
07Jdg 3:29 At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not a man escaped.
07Jdg 3:30 That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.
07Jdg 3:31 After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel.
07Jdg 4:1 After Ehud died, the Israelites once again did evil in the eyes of the LORD.
07Jdg 4:2 So the LORD sold them into the hands of Jabin, a king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim.
07Jdg 4:3 Because he had nine hundred iron chariots and had cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years, they cried to the LORD for help.
07Jdg 4:4 Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that time.
07Jdg 4:5 She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites came to her to have their disputes decided.
07Jdg 4:6 She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, "The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you£º 'Go, take with you ten thousand men of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead the way to Mount Tabor.
07Jdg 4:7 I will lure Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his troops to the Kishon River and give him into your hands.'"
07Jdg 4:8 Barak said to her, "If you go with me, I will go; but if you don't go with me, I won't go."
07Jdg 4:9 "Very well," Deborah said, "I will go with you. But because of the way you are going about this, the honor will not be yours, for the LORD will hand Sisera over to a woman." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh,
07Jdg 4:10 where he summoned Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand men followed him, and Deborah also went with him.
07Jdg 4:11 Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses' brother-in-law, and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh.
07Jdg 4:12 When they told Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
07Jdg 4:13 Sisera gathered together his nine hundred iron chariots and all the men with him, from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River.
07Jdg 4:14 Then Deborah said to Barak, "Go! This is the day the LORD has given Sisera into your hands. Has not the LORD gone ahead of you?" So Barak went down Mount Tabor, followed by ten thousand men.
07Jdg 4:15 At Barak's advance, the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot.
07Jdg 4:16 But Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth Haggoyim. All the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left.
07Jdg 4:17 Sisera, however, fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there were friendly relations between Jabin king of Hazor and the clan of Heber the Kenite.
07Jdg 4:18 Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Come, my lord, come right in. Don't be afraid." So he entered her tent, and she put a covering over him.
07Jdg 4:19 "I'm thirsty," he said. "Please give me some water." She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him up.
07Jdg 4:20 "Stand in the doorway of the tent," he told her. "If someone comes by and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say 'No.'"
07Jdg 4:21 But Jael, Heber's wife, picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.
07Jdg 4:22 Barak came by in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. "Come," she said, "I will show you the man you're looking for." So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple--dead.
07Jdg 4:23 On that day God subdued Jabin, the Canaanite king, before the Israelites.
07Jdg 4:24 And the hand of the Israelites grew stronger and stronger against Jabin, the Canaanite king, until they destroyed him.
07Jdg 5:1 On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song£º
07Jdg 5:2 "When the princes in Israel take the lead, when the people willingly offer themselves--praise the LORD!
07Jdg 5:3 "Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers! I will sing to the LORD, I will sing; I will make music to the LORD, the God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:4 "O LORD, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the land of Edom, the earth shook, the heavens poured, the clouds poured down water.
07Jdg 5:5 The mountains quaked before the LORD, the One of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:6 "In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the roads were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths.
07Jdg 5:7 Village life in Israel ceased, ceased until I, Deborah, arose, arose a mother in Israel.
07Jdg 5:8 When they chose new gods, war came to the city gates, and not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in Israel.
07Jdg 5:9 My heart is with Israel's princes, with the willing volunteers among the people. Praise the LORD!
07Jdg 5:10 "You who ride on white donkeys, sitting on your saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road, consider
07Jdg 5:11 the voice of the singers at the watering places. They recite the righteous acts of the LORD, the righteous acts of his warriors in Israel. "Then the people of the LORD went down to the city gates.
07Jdg 5:12 'Wake up, wake up, Deborah! Wake up, wake up, break out in song! Arise, O Barak! Take captive your captives, O son of Abinoam.'
07Jdg 5:13 "Then the men who were left came down to the nobles; the people of the LORD came to me with the mighty.
07Jdg 5:14 Some came from Ephraim, whose roots were in Amalek; Benjamin was with the people who followed you. From Makir captains came down, from Zebulun those who bear a commander's staff.
07Jdg 5:15 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; yes, Issachar was with Barak, rushing after him into the valley. In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.
07Jdg 5:16 Why did you stay among the campfires to hear the whistling for the flocks? In the districts of Reuben there was much searching of heart.
07Jdg 5:17 Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan. And Dan, why did he linger by the ships? Asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves.
07Jdg 5:18 The people of Zebulun risked their very lives; so did Naphtali on the heights of the field.
07Jdg 5:19 "Kings came, they fought; the kings of Canaan fought at Taanach by the waters of Megiddo, but they carried off no silver, no plunder.
07Jdg 5:20 From the heavens the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera.
07Jdg 5:21 The river Kishon swept them away, the age-old river, the river Kishon. March on, my soul; be strong!
07Jdg 5:22 Then thundered the horses' hoofs--galloping, galloping go his mighty steeds.
07Jdg 5:23 'Curse Meroz,' said the angel of the LORD. 'Curse its people bitterly, because they did not come to help the LORD, to help the LORD against the mighty.'
07Jdg 5:24 "Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, most blessed of tent-dwelling women.
07Jdg 5:25 He asked for water, and she gave him milk; in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk.
07Jdg 5:26 Her hand reached for the tent peg, her right hand for the workman's hammer. She struck Sisera, she crushed his head, she shattered and pierced his temple.
07Jdg 5:27 At her feet he sank, he fell; there he lay. At her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell--dead.
07Jdg 5:28 "Through the window peered Sisera's mother; behind the lattice she cried out, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why is the clatter of his chariots delayed?'
07Jdg 5:29 The wisest of her ladies answer her; indeed, she keeps saying to herself,
07Jdg 5:30 'Are they not finding and dividing the spoils£º a girl or two for each man, colorful garments as plunder for Sisera, colorful garments embroidered, highly embroidered garments for my neck--all this as plunder?'
07Jdg 5:31 "So may all your enemies perish, O LORD! But may they who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength." Then the land had peace forty years.
07Jdg 6:1 Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites.
07Jdg 6:2 Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds.
07Jdg 6:3 Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country.
07Jdg 6:4 They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys.
07Jdg 6:5 They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count the men and their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it.
07Jdg 6:6 Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the LORD for help.
07Jdg 6:7 When the Israelites cried to the LORD because of Midian,
07Jdg 6:8 he sent them a prophet, who said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
07Jdg 6:9 I snatched you from the power of Egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors. I drove them from before you and gave you their land.
07Jdg 6:10 I said to you, 'I am the LORD your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.' But you have not listened to me."
07Jdg 6:11 The angel of the LORD came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites.
07Jdg 6:12 When the angel of the LORD appeared to Gideon, he said, "The LORD is with you, mighty warrior."
07Jdg 6:13 "But sir," Gideon replied, "if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt?' But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian."
07Jdg 6:14 The LORD turned to him and said, "Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand. Am I not sending you?"
07Jdg 6:15 "But Lord," Gideon asked, "how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family."
07Jdg 6:16 The LORD answered, "I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites together."
07Jdg 6:17 Gideon replied, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me.
07Jdg 6:18 Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you." And the LORD said, "I will wait until you return."
07Jdg 6:19 Gideon went in, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak.
07Jdg 6:20 The angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth." And Gideon did so.
07Jdg 6:21 With the tip of the staff that was in his hand, the angel of the LORD touched the meat and the unleavened bread. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the LORD disappeared.
07Jdg 6:22 When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he exclaimed, "Ah, Sovereign LORD! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!"
07Jdg 6:23 But the LORD said to him, "Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die."
07Jdg 6:24 So Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and called it The LORD is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
07Jdg 6:25 That same night the LORD said to him, "Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one seven years old. Tear down your father's altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.
07Jdg 6:26 Then build a proper kind of altar to the LORD your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering."
07Jdg 6:27 So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.
07Jdg 6:28 In the morning when the men of the town got up, there was Baal's altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar!
07Jdg 6:29 They asked each other, "Who did this?" When they carefully investigated, they were told, "Gideon son of Joash did it."
07Jdg 6:30 The men of the town demanded of Joash, "Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal's altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it."
07Jdg 6:31 But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, "Are you going to plead Baal's cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar."
07Jdg 6:32 So that day they called Gideon "Jerub-Baal," saying, "Let Baal contend with him," because he broke down Baal's altar.
07Jdg 6:33 Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.
07Jdg 6:34 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.
07Jdg 6:35 He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them.
07Jdg 6:36 Gideon said to God, "If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised--
07Jdg 6:37 look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said."
07Jdg 6:38 And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew--a bowlful of water.
07Jdg 6:39 Then Gideon said to God, "Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece. This time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew."
07Jdg 6:40 That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.
07Jdg 7:1 Early in the morning, Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) and all his men camped at the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.
07Jdg 7:2 The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many men for me to deliver Midian into their hands. In order that Israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her,
07Jdg 7:3 announce now to the people, 'Anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.'" So twenty-two thousand men left, while ten thousand remained.
07Jdg 7:4 But the LORD said to Gideon, "There are still too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will sift them for you there. If I say, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go; but if I say, 'This one shall not go with you,' he shall not go."
07Jdg 7:5 So Gideon took the men down to the water. There the LORD told him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink."
07Jdg 7:6 Three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.
07Jdg 7:7 The LORD said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men that lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hands. Let all the other men go, each to his own place."
07Jdg 7:8 So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred, who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others. Now the camp of Midian lay below him in the valley.
07Jdg 7:9 During that night the LORD said to Gideon, "Get up, go down against the camp, because I am going to give it into your hands.
07Jdg 7:10 If you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah
07Jdg 7:11 and listen to what they are saying. Afterward, you will be encouraged to attack the camp." So he and Purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp.
07Jdg 7:12 The Midianites, the Amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley, thick as locusts. Their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore.
07Jdg 7:13 Gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream. "I had a dream," he was saying. "A round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the Midianite camp. It struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed."
07Jdg 7:14 His friend responded, "This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has given the Midianites and the whole camp into his hands."
07Jdg 7:15 When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped God. He returned to the camp of Israel and called out, "Get up! The LORD has given the Midianite camp into your hands."
07Jdg 7:16 Dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them, with torches inside.
07Jdg 7:17 "Watch me," he told them. "Follow my lead. When I get to the edge of the camp, do exactly as I do.
07Jdg 7:18 When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets, then from all around the camp blow yours and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon.'"
07Jdg 7:19 Gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had changed the guard. They blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands.
07Jdg 7:20 The three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars. Grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow, they shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"
07Jdg 7:21 While each man held his position around the camp, all the Midianites ran, crying out as they fled.
07Jdg 7:22 When the three hundred trumpets sounded, the LORD caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords. The army fled to Beth Shittah toward Zererah as far as the border of Abel Meholah near Tabbath.
07Jdg 7:23 Israelites from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites.
07Jdg 7:24 Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down against the Midianites and seize the waters of the Jordan ahead of them as far as Beth Barah." So all the men of Ephraim were called out and they took the waters of the Jordan as far as Beth Barah.
07Jdg 7:25 They also captured two of the Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan.
07Jdg 8:1 Now the Ephraimites asked Gideon, "Why have you treated us like this? Why didn't you call us when you went to fight Midian?" And they criticized him sharply.
07Jdg 8:2 But he answered them, "What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't the gleanings of Ephraim's grapes better than the full grape harvest of Abiezer?
07Jdg 8:3 God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the Midianite leaders, into your hands. What was I able to do compared to you?" At this, their resentment against him subsided.
07Jdg 8:4 Gideon and his three hundred men, exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit, came to the Jordan and crossed it.
07Jdg 8:5 He said to the men of Succoth, "Give my troops some bread; they are worn out, and I am still pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
07Jdg 8:6 But the officials of Succoth said, "Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your troops?"
07Jdg 8:7 Then Gideon replied, "Just for that, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers."
07Jdg 8:8 From there he went up to Peniel and made the same request of them, but they answered as the men of Succoth had.
07Jdg 8:9 So he said to the men of Peniel, "When I return in triumph, I will tear down this tower."
07Jdg 8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.
07Jdg 8:11 Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and fell upon the unsuspecting army.
07Jdg 8:12 Zebah and Zalmunna, the two kings of Midian, fled, but he pursued them and captured them, routing their entire army.
07Jdg 8:13 Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres.
07Jdg 8:14 He caught a young man of Succoth and questioned him, and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials of Succoth, the elders of the town.
07Jdg 8:15 Then Gideon came and said to the men of Succoth, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me by saying, 'Do you already have the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna in your possession? Why should we give bread to your exhausted men?'"
07Jdg 8:16 He took the elders of the town and taught the men of Succoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers.
07Jdg 8:17 He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the men of the town.
07Jdg 8:18 Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?" "Men like you," they answered, "each one with the bearing of a prince."
07Jdg 8:19 Gideon replied, "Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the LORD lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you."
07Jdg 8:20 Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, "Kill them!" But Jether did not draw his sword, because he was only a boy and was afraid.
07Jdg 8:21 Zebah and Zalmunna said, "Come, do it yourself. 'As is the man, so is his strength.'" So Gideon stepped forward and killed them, and took the ornaments off their camels' necks.
07Jdg 8:22 The Israelites said to Gideon, "Rule over us--you, your son and your grandson--because you have saved us out of the hand of Midian."
07Jdg 8:23 But Gideon told them, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The LORD will rule over you."
07Jdg 8:24 And he said, "I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder." (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.)
07Jdg 8:25 They answered, "We'll be glad to give them." So they spread out a garment, and each man threw a ring from his plunder onto it.
07Jdg 8:26 The weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels, not counting the ornaments, the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian or the chains that were on their camels' necks.
07Jdg 8:27 Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.
07Jdg 8:28 Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon's lifetime, the land enjoyed peace forty years.
07Jdg 8:29 Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back home to live.
07Jdg 8:30 He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives.
07Jdg 8:31 His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech.
07Jdg 8:32 Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
07Jdg 8:33 No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals. They set up Baal-Berith as their god and
07Jdg 8:34 did not remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.
07Jdg 8:35 They also failed to show kindness to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) for all the good things he had done for them.
07Jdg 9:1 Abimelech son of Jerub-Baal went to his mother's brothers in Shechem and said to them and to all his mother's clan,
07Jdg 9:2 "Ask all the citizens of Shechem, 'Which is better for you£º to have all seventy of Jerub-Baal's sons rule over you, or just one man?' Remember, I am your flesh and blood."
07Jdg 9:3 When the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of Shechem, they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our brother."
07Jdg 9:4 They gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelech used it to hire reckless adventurers, who became his followers.
07Jdg 9:5 He went to his father's home in Ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerub-Baal. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerub-Baal, escaped by hiding.
07Jdg 9:6 Then all the citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in Shechem to crown Abimelech king.
07Jdg 9:7 When Jotham was told about this, he climbed up on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, "Listen to me, citizens of Shechem, so that God may listen to you.
07Jdg 9:8 One day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Be our king.'
07Jdg 9:9 "But the olive tree answered, 'Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and men are honored, to hold sway over the trees?'
07Jdg 9:10 "Next, the trees said to the fig tree, 'Come and be our king.'
07Jdg 9:11 "But the fig tree replied, 'Should I give up my fruit, so good and sweet, to hold sway over the trees?'
07Jdg 9:12 "Then the trees said to the vine, 'Come and be our king.'
07Jdg 9:13 "But the vine answered, 'Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and men, to hold sway over the trees?'
07Jdg 9:14 "Finally all the trees said to the thornbush, 'Come and be our king.'
07Jdg 9:15 "The thornbush said to the trees, 'If you really want to anoint me king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon!'
07Jdg 9:16 "Now if you have acted honorably and in good faith when you made Abimelech king, and if you have been fair to Jerub-Baal and his family, and if you have treated him as he deserves--
07Jdg 9:17 and to think that my father fought for you, risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian
07Jdg 9:18 (but today you have revolted against my father's family, murdered his seventy sons on a single stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his slave girl, king over the citizens of Shechem because he is your brother)--
07Jdg 9:19 if then you have acted honorably and in good faith toward Jerub-Baal and his family today, may Abimelech be your joy, and may you be his, too!
07Jdg 9:20 But if you have not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume you, citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and let fire come out from you, citizens of Shechem and Beth Millo, and consume Abimelech!"
07Jdg 9:21 Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:22 After Abimelech had governed Israel three years,
07Jdg 9:23 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem, who acted treacherously against Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:24 God did this in order that the crime against Jerub-Baal's seventy sons, the shedding of their blood, might be avenged on their brother Abimelech and on the citizens of Shechem, who had helped him murder his brothers.
07Jdg 9:25 In opposition to him these citizens of Shechem set men on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by, and this was reported to Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:26 Now Gaal son of Ebed moved with his brothers into Shechem, and its citizens put their confidence in him.
07Jdg 9:27 After they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden them, they held a festival in the temple of their god. While they were eating and drinking, they cursed Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:28 Then Gaal son of Ebed said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should be subject to him? Isn't he Jerub-Baal's son, and isn't Zebul his deputy? Serve the men of Hamor, Shechem's father! Why should we serve Abimelech?
07Jdg 9:29 If only this people were under my command! Then I would get rid of him. I would say to Abimelech, 'Call out your whole army!'"
07Jdg 9:30 When Zebul the governor of the city heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry.
07Jdg 9:31 Under cover he sent messengers to Abimelech, saying, "Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you.
07Jdg 9:32 Now then, during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields.
07Jdg 9:33 In the morning at sunrise, advance against the city. When Gaal and his men come out against you, do whatever your hand finds to do."
07Jdg 9:34 So Abimelech and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies.
07Jdg 9:35 Now Gaal son of Ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance to the city gate just as Abimelech and his soldiers came out from their hiding place.
07Jdg 9:36 When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!" Zebul replied, "You mistake the shadows of the mountains for men."
07Jdg 9:37 But Gaal spoke up again£º "Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and a company is coming from the direction of the soothsayers' tree."
07Jdg 9:38 Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your big talk now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should be subject to him?' Aren't these the men you ridiculed? Go out and fight them!"
07Jdg 9:39 So Gaal led out the citizens of Shechem and fought Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:40 Abimelech chased him, and many fell wounded in the flight--all the way to the entrance to the gate.
07Jdg 9:41 Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.
07Jdg 9:42 The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:43 So he took his men, divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he rose to attack them.
07Jdg 9:44 Abimelech and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance to the city gate. Then two companies rushed upon those in the fields and struck them down.
07Jdg 9:45 All that day Abimelech pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people. Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it.
07Jdg 9:46 On hearing this, the citizens in the tower of Shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of El-Berith.
07Jdg 9:47 When Abimelech heard that they had assembled there,
07Jdg 9:48 he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and cut off some branches, which he lifted to his shoulders. He ordered the men with him, "Quick! Do what you have seen me do!"
07Jdg 9:49 So all the men cut branches and followed Abimelech. They piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire over the people inside. So all the people in the tower of Shechem, about a thousand men and women, also died.
07Jdg 9:50 Next Abimelech went to Thebez and besieged it and captured it.
07Jdg 9:51 Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, to which all the men and women--all the people of the city--fled. They locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof.
07Jdg 9:52 Abimelech went to the tower and stormed it. But as he approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire,
07Jdg 9:53 a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull.
07Jdg 9:54 Hurriedly he called to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that they can't say, 'A woman killed him.'" So his servant ran him through, and he died.
07Jdg 9:55 When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they went home.
07Jdg 9:56 Thus God repaid the wickedness that Abimelech had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers.
07Jdg 9:57 God also made the men of Shechem pay for all their wickedness. The curse of Jotham son of Jerub-Baal came on them.
07Jdg 10:1 After the time of Abimelech a man of Issachar, Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo, rose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim.
07Jdg 10:2 He led Israel twenty-three years; then he died, and was buried in Shamir.
07Jdg 10:3 He was followed by Jair of Gilead, who led Israel twenty-two years.
07Jdg 10:4 He had thirty sons, who rode thirty donkeys. They controlled thirty towns in Gilead, which to this day are called Havvoth Jair.
07Jdg 10:5 When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.
07Jdg 10:6 Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD. They served the Baals and the Ashtoreths, and the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites and the gods of the Philistines. And because the Israelites forsook the LORD and no longer served him,
07Jdg 10:7 he became angry with them. He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites,
07Jdg 10:8 who that year shattered and crushed them. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites.
07Jdg 10:9 The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and the house of Ephraim; and Israel was in great distress.
07Jdg 10:10 Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, "We have sinned against you, forsaking our God and serving the Baals."
07Jdg 10:11 The LORD replied, "When the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,
07Jdg 10:12 the Sidonians, the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you and you cried to me for help, did I not save you from their hands?
07Jdg 10:13 But you have forsaken me and served other gods, so I will no longer save you.
07Jdg 10:14 Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them save you when you are in trouble!"
07Jdg 10:15 But the Israelites said to the LORD, "We have sinned. Do with us whatever you think best, but please rescue us now."
07Jdg 10:16 Then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the LORD. And he could bear Israel's misery no longer.
07Jdg 10:17 When the Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.
07Jdg 10:18 The leaders of the people of Gilead said to each other, "Whoever will launch the attack against the Ammonites will be the head of all those living in Gilead."
07Jdg 11:1 Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. His father was Gilead; his mother was a prostitute.
07Jdg 11:2 Gilead's wife also bore him sons, and when they were grown up, they drove Jephthah away. "You are not going to get any inheritance in our family," they said, "because you are the son of another woman."
07Jdg 11:3 So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where a group of adventurers gathered around him and followed him.
07Jdg 11:4 Some time later, when the Ammonites made war on Israel,
07Jdg 11:5 the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.
07Jdg 11:6 "Come," they said, "be our commander, so we can fight the Ammonites."
07Jdg 11:7 Jephthah said to them, "Didn't you hate me and drive me from my father's house? Why do you come to me now, when you're in trouble?"
07Jdg 11:8 The elders of Gilead said to him, "Nevertheless, we are turning to you now; come with us to fight the Ammonites, and you will be our head over all who live in Gilead."
07Jdg 11:9 Jephthah answered, "Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives them to me--will I really be your head?"
07Jdg 11:10 The elders of Gilead replied, "The LORD is our witness; we will certainly do as you say."
07Jdg 11:11 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. And he repeated all his words before the LORD in Mizpah.
07Jdg 11:12 Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question£º "What do you have against us that you have attacked our country?"
07Jdg 11:13 The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah's messengers, "When Israel came up out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, all the way to the Jordan. Now give it back peaceably."
07Jdg 11:14 Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king,
07Jdg 11:15 saying£º "This is what Jephthah says£º Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.
07Jdg 11:16 But when they came up out of Egypt, Israel went through the desert to the Red Sea and on to Kadesh.
07Jdg 11:17 Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, 'Give us permission to go through your country,' but the king of Edom would not listen. They sent also to the king of Moab, and he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.
07Jdg 11:18 "Next they traveled through the desert, skirted the lands of Edom and Moab, passed along the eastern side of the country of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was its border.
07Jdg 11:19 "Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, 'Let us pass through your country to our own place.'
07Jdg 11:20 Sihon, however, did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. He mustered all his men and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel.
07Jdg 11:21 "Then the LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his men into Israel's hands, and they defeated them. Israel took over all the land of the Amorites who lived in that country,
07Jdg 11:22 capturing all of it from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan.
07Jdg 11:23 "Now since the LORD, the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before his people Israel, what right have you to take it over?
07Jdg 11:24 Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the LORD our God has given us, we will possess.
07Jdg 11:25 Are you better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight with them?
07Jdg 11:26 For three hundred years Israel occupied Heshbon, Aroer, the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the Arnon. Why didn't you retake them during that time?
07Jdg 11:27 I have not wronged you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me. Let the LORD, the Judge, decide the dispute this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites."
07Jdg 11:28 The king of Ammon, however, paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him.
07Jdg 11:29 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah. He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.
07Jdg 11:30 And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD£º "If you give the Ammonites into my hands,
07Jdg 11:31 whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the LORD'S, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering."
07Jdg 11:32 Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gave them into his hands.
07Jdg 11:33 He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon.
07Jdg 11:34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of tambourines! She was an only child. Except for her he had neither son nor daughter.
07Jdg 11:35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, "Oh! My daughter! You have made me miserable and wretched, because I have made a vow to the LORD that I cannot break."
07Jdg 11:36 "My father," she replied, "you have given your word to the LORD. Do to me just as you promised, now that the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.
07Jdg 11:37 But grant me this one request," she said. "Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry."
07Jdg 11:38 "You may go," he said. And he let her go for two months. She and the girls went into the hills and wept because she would never marry.
07Jdg 11:39 After the two months, she returned to her father and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin. From this comes the Israelite custom
07Jdg 11:40 that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
07Jdg 12:1 The men of Ephraim called out their forces, crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We're going to burn down your house over your head."
07Jdg 12:2 Jephthah answered, "I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites, and although I called, you didn't save me out of their hands.
07Jdg 12:3 When I saw that you wouldn't help, I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gave me the victory over them. Now why have you come up today to fight me?"
07Jdg 12:4 Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, "You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh."
07Jdg 12:5 The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said, "Let me cross over," the men of Gilead asked him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he replied, "No,"
07Jdg 12:6 they said, "All right, say 'Shibboleth.'" If he said, "Sibboleth," because he could not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time.
07Jdg 12:7 Jephthah led Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died, and was buried in a town in Gilead.
07Jdg 12:8 After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem led Israel.
07Jdg 12:9 He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters away in marriage to those outside his clan, and for his sons he brought in thirty young women as wives from outside his clan. Ibzan led Israel seven years.
07Jdg 12:10 Then Ibzan died, and was buried in Bethlehem.
07Jdg 12:11 After him, Elon the Zebulunite led Israel ten years.
07Jdg 12:12 Then Elon died, and was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
07Jdg 12:13 After him, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, led Israel.
07Jdg 12:14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He led Israel eight years.
07Jdg 12:15 Then Abdon son of Hillel died, and was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
07Jdg 13:1 Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the LORD, so the LORD delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years.
07Jdg 13:2 A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was sterile and remained childless.
07Jdg 13:3 The angel of the LORD appeared to her and said, "You are sterile and childless, but you are going to conceive and have a son.
07Jdg 13:4 Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean,
07Jdg 13:5 because you will conceive and give birth to a son. No razor may be used on his head, because the boy is to be a Nazirite, set apart to God from birth, and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hands of the Philistines."
07Jdg 13:6 Then the woman went to her husband and told him, "A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn't ask him where he came from, and he didn't tell me his name.
07Jdg 13:7 But he said to me, 'You will conceive and give birth to a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from birth until the day of his death.'"
07Jdg 13:8 Then Manoah prayed to the LORD£º "O Lord, I beg you, let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born."
07Jdg 13:9 God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her.
07Jdg 13:10 The woman hurried to tell her husband, "He's here! The man who appeared to me the other day!"
07Jdg 13:11 Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, "Are you the one who talked to my wife?" "I am," he said.
07Jdg 13:12 So Manoah asked him, "When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule for the boy's life and work?"
07Jdg 13:13 The angel of the LORD answered, "Your wife must do all that I have told her.
07Jdg 13:14 She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her."
07Jdg 13:15 Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you."
07Jdg 13:16 The angel of the LORD replied, "Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD." (Manoah did not realize that it was the angel of the LORD.)
07Jdg 13:17 Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the LORD, "What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?"
07Jdg 13:18 He replied, "Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding."
07Jdg 13:19 Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the LORD. And the LORD did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched£º
07Jdg 13:20 As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground.
07Jdg 13:21 When the angel of the LORD did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it was the angel of the LORD.
07Jdg 13:22 "We are doomed to die!" he said to his wife. "We have seen God!"
07Jdg 13:23 But his wife answered, "If the LORD had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this."
07Jdg 13:24 The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson. He grew and the LORD blessed him,
07Jdg 13:25 and the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him while he was in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
07Jdg 14:1 Samson went down to Timnah and saw there a young Philistine woman.
07Jdg 14:2 When he returned, he said to his father and mother, "I have seen a Philistine woman in Timnah; now get her for me as my wife."
07Jdg 14:3 His father and mother replied, "Isn't there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines to get a wife?" But Samson said to his father, "Get her for me. She's the right one for me."
07Jdg 14:4 (His parents did not know that this was from the LORD, who was seeking an occasion to confront the Philistines; for at that time they were ruling over Israel.)
07Jdg 14:5 Samson went down to Timnah together with his father and mother. As they approached the vineyards of Timnah, suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him.
07Jdg 14:6 The Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat. But he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done.
07Jdg 14:7 Then he went down and talked with the woman, and he liked her.
07Jdg 14:8 Some time later, when he went back to marry her, he turned aside to look at the lion's carcass. In it was a swarm of bees and some honey,
07Jdg 14:9 which he scooped out with his hands and ate as he went along. When he rejoined his parents, he gave them some, and they too ate it. But he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lion's carcass.
07Jdg 14:10 Now his father went down to see the woman. And Samson made a feast there, as was customary for bridegrooms.
07Jdg 14:11 When he appeared, he was given thirty companions.
07Jdg 14:12 "Let me tell you a riddle," Samson said to them. "If you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast, I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes.
07Jdg 14:13 If you can't tell me the answer, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes." "Tell us your riddle," they said. "Let's hear it."
07Jdg 14:14 He replied, "Out of the eater, something to eat; out of the strong, something sweet." For three days they could not give the answer.
07Jdg 14:15 On the fourth day, they said to Samson's wife, "Coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us, or we will burn you and your father's household to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?"
07Jdg 14:16 Then Samson's wife threw herself on him, sobbing, "You hate me! You don't really love me. You've given my people a riddle, but you haven't told me the answer." "I haven't even explained it to my father or mother," he replied, "so why should I explain it to you?"
07Jdg 14:17 She cried the whole seven days of the feast. So on the seventh day he finally told her, because she continued to press him. She in turn explained the riddle to her people.
07Jdg 14:18 Before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him, "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" Samson said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have solved my riddle."
07Jdg 14:19 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power. He went down to Ashkelon, struck down thirty of their men, stripped them of their belongings and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle. Burning with anger, he went up to his father's house.
07Jdg 14:20 And Samson's wife was given to the friend who had attended him at his wedding.
07Jdg 15:1 Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife. He said, "I'm going to my wife's room." But her father would not let him go in.
07Jdg 15:2 "I was so sure you thoroughly hated her," he said, "that I gave her to your friend. Isn't her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead."
07Jdg 15:3 Samson said to them, "This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines; I will really harm them."
07Jdg 15:4 So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails,
07Jdg 15:5 lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves.
07Jdg 15:6 When the Philistines asked, "Who did this?" they were told, "Samson, the Timnite's son-in-law, because his wife was given to his friend." So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.
07Jdg 15:7 Samson said to them, "Since you've acted like this, I won't stop until I get my revenge on you."
07Jdg 15:8 He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.
07Jdg 15:9 The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.
07Jdg 15:10 The men of Judah asked, "Why have you come to fight us?" "We have come to take Samson prisoner," they answered, "to do to him as he did to us."
07Jdg 15:11 Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, "Don't you realize that the Philistines are rulers over us? What have you done to us?" He answered, "I merely did to them what they did to me."
07Jdg 15:12 They said to him, "We've come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines." Samson said, "Swear to me that you won't kill me yourselves."
07Jdg 15:13 "Agreed," they answered. "We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.
07Jdg 15:14 As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting. The Spirit of the LORD came upon him in power. The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.
07Jdg 15:15 Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.
07Jdg 15:16 Then Samson said, "With a donkey's jawbone I have made donkeys of them. With a donkey's jawbone I have killed a thousand men."
07Jdg 15:17 When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi.
07Jdg 15:18 Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the LORD, "You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
07Jdg 15:19 Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he revived. So the spring was called En Hakkore, and it is still there in Lehi.
07Jdg 15:20 Samson led Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
07Jdg 16:1 One day Samson went to Gaza, where he saw a prostitute. He went in to spend the night with her.
07Jdg 16:2 The people of Gaza were told, "Samson is here!" So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate. They made no move during the night, saying, "At dawn we'll kill him."
07Jdg 16:3 But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night. Then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate, together with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron.
07Jdg 16:4 Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek whose name was Delilah.
07Jdg 16:5 The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, "See if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver."
07Jdg 16:6 So Delilah said to Samson, "Tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued."
07Jdg 16:7 Samson answered her, "If anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs that have not been dried, I'll become as weak as any other man."
07Jdg 16:8 Then the rulers of the Philistines brought her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried, and she tied him with them.
07Jdg 16:9 With men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.
07Jdg 16:10 Then Delilah said to Samson, "You have made a fool of me; you lied to me. Come now, tell me how you can be tied."
07Jdg 16:11 He said, "If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I'll become as weak as any other man."
07Jdg 16:12 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" But he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads.
07Jdg 16:13 Delilah then said to Samson, "Until now, you have been making a fool of me and lying to me. Tell me how you can be tied." He replied, "If you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin, I'll become as weak as any other man." So while he was sleeping, Delilah took the seven braids of his head, wove them into the fabric
07Jdg 16:14 and tightened it with the pin. Again she called to him, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom, with the fabric.
07Jdg 16:15 Then she said to him, "How can you say, 'I love you,' when you won't confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and haven't told me the secret of your great strength."
07Jdg 16:16 With such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death.
07Jdg 16:17 So he told her everything. "No razor has ever been used on my head," he said, "because I have been a Nazirite set apart to God since birth. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man."
07Jdg 16:18 When Delilah saw that he had told her everything, she sent word to the rulers of the Philistines, "Come back once more; he has told me everything." So the rulers of the Philistines returned with the silver in their hands.
07Jdg 16:19 Having put him to sleep on her lap, she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair, and so began to subdue him. And his strength left him.
07Jdg 16:20 Then she called, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you!" He awoke from his sleep and thought, "I'll go out as before and shake myself free." But he did not know that the LORD had left him.
07Jdg 16:21 Then the Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. Binding him with bronze shackles, they set him to grinding in the prison.
07Jdg 16:22 But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.
07Jdg 16:23 Now the rulers of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, "Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands."
07Jdg 16:24 When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, "Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain."
07Jdg 16:25 While they were in high spirits, they shouted, "Bring out Samson to entertain us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he performed for them. When they stood him among the pillars,
07Jdg 16:26 Samson said to the servant who held his hand, "Put me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them."
07Jdg 16:27 Now the temple was crowded with men and women; all the rulers of the Philistines were there, and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.
07Jdg 16:28 Then Samson prayed to the LORD, "O Sovereign LORD, remember me. O God, please strengthen me just once more, and let me with one blow get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes."
07Jdg 16:29 Then Samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood. Bracing himself against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other,
07Jdg 16:30 Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" Then he pushed with all his might, and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it. Thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived.
07Jdg 16:31 Then his brothers and his father's whole family went down to get him. They brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had led Israel twenty years.
07Jdg 17:1 Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim
07Jdg 17:2 said to his mother, "The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse--I have that silver with me; I took it." Then his mother said, "The LORD bless you, my son!"
07Jdg 17:3 When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, "I solemnly consecrate my silver to the LORD for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol. I will give it back to you."
07Jdg 17:4 So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into the image and the idol. And they were put in Micah's house.
07Jdg 17:5 Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest.
07Jdg 17:6 In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.
07Jdg 17:7 A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,
07Jdg 17:8 left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim.
07Jdg 17:9 Micah asked him, "Where are you from?" "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah," he said, "and I'm looking for a place to stay."
07Jdg 17:10 Then Micah said to him, "Live with me and be my father and priest, and I'll give you ten shekels of silver a year, your clothes and your food."
07Jdg 17:11 So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man was to him like one of his sons.
07Jdg 17:12 Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.
07Jdg 17:13 And Micah said, "Now I know that the LORD will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest."
07Jdg 18:1 In those days Israel had no king. And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle, because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.
07Jdg 18:2 So the Danites sent five warriors from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it. These men represented all their clans. They told them, "Go, explore the land." The men entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.
07Jdg 18:3 When they were near Micah's house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite; so they turned in there and asked him, "Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?"
07Jdg 18:4 He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, "He has hired me and I am his priest."
07Jdg 18:5 Then they said to him, "Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful."
07Jdg 18:6 The priest answered them, "Go in peace. Your journey has the LORD'S approval."
07Jdg 18:7 So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety, like the Sidonians, unsuspecting and secure. And since their land lacked nothing, they were prosperous. Also, they lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else.
07Jdg 18:8 When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers asked them, "How did you find things?"
07Jdg 18:9 They answered, "Come on, let's attack them! We have seen that the land is very good. Aren't you going to do something? Don't hesitate to go there and take it over.
07Jdg 18:10 When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands, a land that lacks nothing whatever."
07Jdg 18:11 Then six hundred men from the clan of the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.
07Jdg 18:12 On their way they set up camp near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan to this day.
07Jdg 18:13 From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah's house.
07Jdg 18:14 Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their brothers, "Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, other household gods, a carved image and a cast idol? Now you know what to do."
07Jdg 18:15 So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah's place and greeted him.
07Jdg 18:16 The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance to the gate.
07Jdg 18:17 The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance to the gate.
07Jdg 18:18 When these men went into Micah's house and took the carved image, the ephod, the other household gods and the cast idol, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"
07Jdg 18:19 They answered him, "Be quiet! Don't say a word. Come with us, and be our father and priest. Isn't it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man's household?"
07Jdg 18:20 Then the priest was glad. He took the ephod, the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people.
07Jdg 18:21 Putting their little children, their livestock and their possessions in front of them, they turned away and left.
07Jdg 18:22 When they had gone some distance from Micah's house, the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.
07Jdg 18:23 As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, "What's the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?"
07Jdg 18:24 He replied, "You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have? How can you ask, 'What's the matter with you?'"
07Jdg 18:25 The Danites answered, "Don't argue with us, or some hot-tempered men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives."
07Jdg 18:26 So the Danites went their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home.
07Jdg 18:27 Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish, against a peaceful and unsuspecting people. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.
07Jdg 18:28 There was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from Sidon and had no relationship with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.
07Jdg 18:29 They named it Dan after their forefather Dan, who was born to Israel--though the city used to be called Laish.
07Jdg 18:30 There the Danites set up for themselves the idols, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land.
07Jdg 18:31 They continued to use the idols Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.
07Jdg 19:1 In those days Israel had no king. Now a Levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.
07Jdg 19:2 But she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her father's house in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months,
07Jdg 19:3 her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her father's house, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him.
07Jdg 19:4 His father-in-law, the girl's father, prevailed upon him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there.
07Jdg 19:5 On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Refresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go."
07Jdg 19:6 So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the girl's father said, "Please stay tonight and enjoy yourself."
07Jdg 19:7 And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night.
07Jdg 19:8 On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the girl's father said, "Refresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!" So the two of them ate together.
07Jdg 19:9 Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said, "Now look, it's almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home."
07Jdg 19:10 But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.
07Jdg 19:11 When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, "Come, let's stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night."
07Jdg 19:12 His master replied, "No. We won't go into an alien city, whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah."
07Jdg 19:13 He added, "Come, let's try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places."
07Jdg 19:14 So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin.
07Jdg 19:15 There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them into his home for the night.
07Jdg 19:16 That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the men of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields.
07Jdg 19:17 When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, "Where are you going? Where did you come from?"
07Jdg 19:18 He answered, "We are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the LORD. No one has taken me into his house.
07Jdg 19:19 We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants--me, your maidservant, and the young man with us. We don't need anything."
07Jdg 19:20 "You are welcome at my house," the old man said. "Let me supply whatever you need. Only don't spend the night in the square."
07Jdg 19:21 So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink.
07Jdg 19:22 While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, "Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him."
07Jdg 19:23 The owner of the house went outside and said to them, "No, my friends, don't be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don't do this disgraceful thing.
07Jdg 19:24 Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But to this man, don't do such a disgraceful thing."
07Jdg 19:25 But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go.
07Jdg 19:26 At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.
07Jdg 19:27 When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.
07Jdg 19:28 He said to her, "Get up; let's go." But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.
07Jdg 19:29 When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel.
07Jdg 19:30 Everyone who saw it said, "Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Think about it! Consider it! Tell us what to do!"
07Jdg 20:1 Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came out as one man and assembled before the LORD in Mizpah.
07Jdg 20:2 The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand soldiers armed with swords.
07Jdg 20:3 (The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the Israelites said, "Tell us how this awful thing happened."
07Jdg 20:4 So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said, "I and my concubine came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.
07Jdg 20:5 During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died.
07Jdg 20:6 I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of Israel's inheritance, because they committed this lewd and disgraceful act in Israel.
07Jdg 20:7 Now, all you Israelites, speak up and give your verdict."
07Jdg 20:8 All the people rose as one man, saying, "None of us will go home. No, not one of us will return to his house.
07Jdg 20:9 But now this is what we'll do to Gibeah£º We'll go up against it as the lot directs.
07Jdg 20:10 We'll take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from a thousand, and a thousand from ten thousand, to get provisions for the army. Then, when the army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin, it can give them what they deserve for all this vileness done in Israel."
07Jdg 20:11 So all the men of Israel got together and united as one man against the city.
07Jdg 20:12 The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What about this awful crime that was committed among you?
07Jdg 20:13 Now surrender those wicked men of Gibeah so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel." But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites.
07Jdg 20:14 From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.
07Jdg 20:15 At once the Benjamites mobilized twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, in addition to seven hundred chosen men from those living in Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:16 Among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
07Jdg 20:17 Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all of them fighting men.
07Jdg 20:18 The Israelites went up to Bethel and inquired of God. They said, "Who of us shall go first to fight against the Benjamites?" The LORD replied, "Judah shall go first."
07Jdg 20:19 The next morning the Israelites got up and pitched camp near Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:20 The men of Israel went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:21 The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day.
07Jdg 20:22 But the men of Israel encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day.
07Jdg 20:23 The Israelites went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and they inquired of the LORD. They said, "Shall we go up again to battle against the Benjamites, our brothers?" The LORD answered, "Go up against them."
07Jdg 20:24 Then the Israelites drew near to Benjamin the second day.
07Jdg 20:25 This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them, they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords.
07Jdg 20:26 Then the Israelites, all the people, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the LORD. They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the LORD.
07Jdg 20:27 And the Israelites inquired of the LORD. (In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there,
07Jdg 20:28 with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.) They asked, "Shall we go up again to battle with Benjamin our brother, or not?" The LORD responded, "Go, for tomorrow I will give them into your hands."
07Jdg 20:29 Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:30 They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before.
07Jdg 20:31 The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads--the one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:32 While the Benjamites were saying, "We are defeating them as before," the Israelites were saying, "Let's retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads."
07Jdg 20:33 All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west of Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:34 Then ten thousand of Israel's finest men made a frontal attack on Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that the Benjamites did not realize how near disaster was.
07Jdg 20:35 The LORD defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites, all armed with swords.
07Jdg 20:36 Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten. Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:37 The men who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into Gibeah, spread out and put the whole city to the sword.
07Jdg 20:38 The men of Israel had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,
07Jdg 20:39 and then the men of Israel would turn in the battle. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the men of Israel (about thirty), and they said, "We are defeating them as in the first battle."
07Jdg 20:40 But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the smoke of the whole city going up into the sky.
07Jdg 20:41 Then the men of Israel turned on them, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, because they realized that disaster had come upon them.
07Jdg 20:42 So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the desert, but they could not escape the battle. And the men of Israel who came out of the towns cut them down there.
07Jdg 20:43 They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.
07Jdg 20:44 Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.
07Jdg 20:45 As they turned and fled toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads. They kept pressing after the Benjamites as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more.
07Jdg 20:46 On that day twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.
07Jdg 20:47 But six hundred men turned and fled into the desert to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed four months.
07Jdg 20:48 The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. All the towns they came across they set on fire.
07Jdg 21:1 The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah£º "Not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite."
07Jdg 21:2 The people went to Bethel, where they sat before God until evening, raising their voices and weeping bitterly.
07Jdg 21:3 "O LORD, the God of Israel," they cried, "why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?"
07Jdg 21:4 Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.
07Jdg 21:5 Then the Israelites asked, "Who from all the tribes of Israel has failed to assemble before the LORD?" For they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah should certainly be put to death.
07Jdg 21:6 Now the Israelites grieved for their brothers, the Benjamites. "Today one tribe is cut off from Israel," they said.
07Jdg 21:7 "How can we provide wives for those who are left, since we have taken an oath by the LORD not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?"
07Jdg 21:8 Then they asked, "Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to assemble before the LORD at Mizpah?" They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.
07Jdg 21:9 For when they counted the people, they found that none of the people of Jabesh Gilead were there.
07Jdg 21:10 So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead and put to the sword those living there, including the women and children.
07Jdg 21:11 "This is what you are to do," they said. "Kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin."
07Jdg 21:12 They found among the people living in Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man, and they took them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.
07Jdg 21:13 Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.
07Jdg 21:14 So the Benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared. But there were not enough for all of them.
07Jdg 21:15 The people grieved for Benjamin, because the LORD had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.
07Jdg 21:16 And the elders of the assembly said, "With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?
07Jdg 21:17 The Benjamite survivors must have heirs," they said, "so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.
07Jdg 21:18 We can't give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath£º 'Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.'
07Jdg 21:19 But look, there is the annual festival of the LORD in Shiloh, to the north of Bethel, and east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and to the south of Lebonah."
07Jdg 21:20 So they instructed the Benjamites, saying, "Go and hide in the vineyards
07Jdg 21:21 and watch. When the girls of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing, then rush from the vineyards and each of you seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.
07Jdg 21:22 When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them, 'Do us a kindness by helping them, because we did not get wives for them during the war, and you are innocent, since you did not give your daughters to them.'"
07Jdg 21:23 So that is what the Benjamites did. While the girls were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife. Then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them.
07Jdg 21:24 At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans, each to his own inheritance.
07Jdg 21:25 In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit.
08
08Ru 1:1 In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab.
08Ru 1:2 The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there.
08Ru 1:3 Now Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left with her two sons.
08Ru 1:4 They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years,
08Ru 1:5 both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband.
08Ru 1:6 When she heard in Moab that the LORD had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, Naomi and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there.
08Ru 1:7 With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah.
08Ru 1:8 Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back, each of you, to your mother's home. May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me.
08Ru 1:9 May the LORD grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband." Then she kissed them and they wept aloud
08Ru 1:10 and said to her, "We will go back with you to your people."
08Ru 1:11 But Naomi said, "Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands?
08Ru 1:12 Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me--even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons--
08Ru 1:13 would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD'S hand has gone out against me!"
08Ru 1:14 At this they wept again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-by, but Ruth clung to her.
08Ru 1:15 "Look," said Naomi, "your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her."
08Ru 1:16 But Ruth replied, "Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.
08Ru 1:17 Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me."
08Ru 1:18 When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.
08Ru 1:19 So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, "Can this be Naomi?"
08Ru 1:20 "Don't call me Naomi," she told them. "Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very bitter.
08Ru 1:21 I went away full, but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The LORD has afflicted me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me."
08Ru 1:22 So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
08Ru 2:1 Now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side, from the clan of Elimelech, a man of standing, whose name was Boaz.
08Ru 2:2 And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor." Naomi said to her, "Go ahead, my daughter."
08Ru 2:3 So she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she found herself working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.
08Ru 2:4 Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, "The LORD be with you!" "The LORD bless you!" they called back.
08Ru 2:5 Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, "Whose young woman is that?"
08Ru 2:6 The foreman replied, "She is the Moabitess who came back from Moab with Naomi.
08Ru 2:7 She said, 'Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.' She went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter."
08Ru 2:8 So Boaz said to Ruth, "My daughter, listen to me. Don't go and glean in another field and don't go away from here. Stay here with my servant girls.
08Ru 2:9 Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the girls. I have told the men not to touch you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled."
08Ru 2:10 At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She exclaimed, "Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me--a foreigner?"
08Ru 2:11 Boaz replied, "I've been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband--how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before.
08Ru 2:12 May the LORD repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."
08Ru 2:13 "May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord," she said. "You have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant--though I do not have the standing of one of your servant girls."
08Ru 2:14 At mealtime Boaz said to her, "Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar." When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over.
08Ru 2:15 As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, "Even if she gathers among the sheaves, don't embarrass her.
08Ru 2:16 Rather, pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don't rebuke her."
08Ru 2:17 So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.
08Ru 2:18 She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough.
08Ru 2:19 Her mother-in-law asked her, "Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!" Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. "The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz," she said.
08Ru 2:20 "The LORD bless him!" Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. "He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead." She added, "That man is our close relative; he is one of our kinsman-redeemers."
08Ru 2:21 Then Ruth the Moabitess said, "He even said to me, 'Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.'"
08Ru 2:22 Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, "It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with his girls, because in someone else's field you might be harmed."
08Ru 2:23 So Ruth stayed close to the servant girls of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
08Ru 3:1 One day Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, "My daughter, should I not try to find a home for you, where you will be well provided for?
08Ru 3:2 Is not Boaz, with whose servant girls you have been, a kinsman of ours? Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor.
08Ru 3:3 Wash and perfume yourself, and put on your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.
08Ru 3:4 When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do."
08Ru 3:5 "I will do whatever you say," Ruth answered.
08Ru 3:6 So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do.
08Ru 3:7 When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down.
08Ru 3:8 In the middle of the night something startled the man, and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet.
08Ru 3:9 "Who are you?" he asked. "I am your servant Ruth," she said. "Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a kinsman-redeemer."
08Ru 3:10 "The LORD bless you, my daughter," he replied. "This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier£º You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor.
08Ru 3:11 And now, my daughter, don't be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of noble character.
08Ru 3:12 Although it is true that I am near of kin, there is a kinsman-redeemer nearer than I.
08Ru 3:13 Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to redeem, good; let him redeem. But if he is not willing, as surely as the LORD lives I will do it. Lie here until morning."
08Ru 3:14 So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, "Don't let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor."
08Ru 3:15 He also said, "Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out." When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and put it on her. Then he went back to town.
08Ru 3:16 When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "How did it go, my daughter?" Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her
08Ru 3:17 and added, "He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"
08Ru 3:18 Then Naomi said, "Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today."
08Ru 4:1 Meanwhile Boaz went up to the town gate and sat there. When the kinsman-redeemer he had mentioned came along, Boaz said, "Come over here, my friend, and sit down." So he went over and sat down.
08Ru 4:2 Boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said, "Sit here," and they did so.
08Ru 4:3 Then he said to the kinsman-redeemer, "Naomi, who has come back from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
08Ru 4:4 I thought I should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so. But if you will not, tell me, so I will know. For no one has the right to do it except you, and I am next in line." "I will redeem it," he said.
08Ru 4:5 Then Boaz said, "On the day you buy the land from Naomi and from Ruth the Moabitess, you acquire the dead man's widow, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property."
08Ru 4:6 At this, the kinsman-redeemer said, "Then I cannot redeem it because I might endanger my own estate. You redeem it yourself. I cannot do it."
08Ru 4:7 (Now in earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.)
08Ru 4:8 So the kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz, "Buy it yourself." And he removed his sandal.
08Ru 4:9 Then Boaz announced to the elders and all the people, "Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion and Mahlon.
08Ru 4:10 I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon's widow, as my wife, in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from the town records. Today you are witnesses!"
08Ru 4:11 Then the elders and all those at the gate said, "We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you have standing in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.
08Ru 4:12 Through the offspring the LORD gives you by this young woman, may your family be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah."
08Ru 4:13 So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. Then he went to her, and the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.
08Ru 4:14 The women said to Naomi£º "Praise be to the LORD, who this day has not left you without a kinsman-redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!
08Ru 4:15 He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth."
08Ru 4:16 Then Naomi took the child, laid him in her lap and cared for him.
08Ru 4:17 The women living there said, "Naomi has a son." And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.
08Ru 4:18 This, then, is the family line of Perez£º Perez was the father of Hezron,
08Ru 4:19 Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab,
08Ru 4:20 Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon,
08Ru 4:21 Salmon the father of Boaz, Boaz the father of Obed,
08Ru 4:22 Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David.
09
091Sm 1:1 There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.
091Sm 1:2 He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
091Sm 1:3 Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD.
091Sm 1:4 Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.
091Sm 1:5 But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb.
091Sm 1:6 And because the LORD had closed her womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her.
091Sm 1:7 This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat.
091Sm 1:8 Elkanah her husband would say to her, "Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don't you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?"
091Sm 1:9 Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the LORD'S temple.
091Sm 1:10 In bitterness of soul Hannah wept much and prayed to the LORD.
091Sm 1:11 And she made a vow, saying, "O LORD Almighty, if you will only look upon your servant's misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the LORD for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head."
091Sm 1:12 As she kept on praying to the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.
091Sm 1:13 Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk
091Sm 1:14 and said to her, "How long will you keep on getting drunk? Get rid of your wine."
091Sm 1:15 "Not so, my lord," Hannah replied, "I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the LORD.
091Sm 1:16 Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."
091Sm 1:17 Eli answered, "Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him."
091Sm 1:18 She said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.
091Sm 1:19 Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the LORD and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah lay with Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her.
091Sm 1:20 So in the course of time Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, "Because I asked the LORD for him."
091Sm 1:21 When the man Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the LORD and to fulfill his vow,
091Sm 1:22 Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, "After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the LORD, and he will live there always."
091Sm 1:23 "Do what seems best to you," Elkanah her husband told her. "Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the LORD make good his word." So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.
091Sm 1:24 After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh.
091Sm 1:25 When they had slaughtered the bull, they brought the boy to Eli,
091Sm 1:26 and she said to him, "As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the LORD.
091Sm 1:27 I prayed for this child, and the LORD has granted me what I asked of him.
091Sm 1:28 So now I give him to the LORD. For his whole life he will be given over to the LORD." And he worshiped the LORD there.
091Sm 2:1 Then Hannah prayed and said£º "My heart rejoices in the LORD; in the LORD my horn is lifted high. My mouth boasts over my enemies, for I delight in your deliverance.
091Sm 2:2 "There is no one holy like the LORD; there is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.
091Sm 2:3 "Do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance, for the LORD is a God who knows, and by him deeds are weighed.
091Sm 2:4 "The bows of the warriors are broken, but those who stumbled are armed with strength.
091Sm 2:5 Those who were full hire themselves out for food, but those who were hungry hunger no more. She who was barren has borne seven children, but she who has had many sons pines away.
091Sm 2:6 "The LORD brings death and makes alive; he brings down to the grave and raises up.
091Sm 2:7 The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.
091Sm 2:8 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap; he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor. "For the foundations of the earth are the LORD'S; upon them he has set the world.
091Sm 2:9 He will guard the feet of his saints, but the wicked will be silenced in darkness. "It is not by strength that one prevails;
091Sm 2:10 those who oppose the LORD will be shattered. He will thunder against them from heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth. "He will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed."
091Sm 2:11 Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the LORD under Eli the priest.
091Sm 2:12 Eli's sons were wicked men; they had no regard for the LORD.
091Sm 2:13 Now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled, the servant of the priest would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand.
091Sm 2:14 He would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.
091Sm 2:15 But even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give the priest some meat to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."
091Sm 2:16 If the man said to him, "Let the fat be burned up first, and then take whatever you want," the servant would then answer, "No, hand it over now; if you don't, I'll take it by force."
091Sm 2:17 This sin of the young men was very great in the LORD'S sight, for they were treating the LORD'S offering with contempt.
091Sm 2:18 But Samuel was ministering before the LORD--a boy wearing a linen ephod.
091Sm 2:19 Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.
091Sm 2:20 Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, "May the LORD give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the LORD." Then they would go home.
091Sm 2:21 And the LORD was gracious to Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.
091Sm 2:22 Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
091Sm 2:23 So he said to them, "Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours.
091Sm 2:24 No, my sons; it is not a good report that I hear spreading among the LORD'S people.
091Sm 2:25 If a man sins against another man, God may mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who will intercede for him?" His sons, however, did not listen to their father's rebuke, for it was the LORD'S will to put them to death.
091Sm 2:26 And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.
091Sm 2:27 Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, "This is what the LORD says£º 'Did I not clearly reveal myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh?
091Sm 2:28 I chose your father out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your father's house all the offerings made with fire by the Israelites.
091Sm 2:29 Why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?'
091Sm 2:30 "Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, declares£º 'I promised that your house and your father's house would minister before me forever.' But now the LORD declares£º 'Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained.
091Sm 2:31 The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your family line
091Sm 2:32 and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, in your family line there will never be an old man.
091Sm 2:33 Every one of you that I do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.
091Sm 2:34 "'And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you--they will both die on the same day.
091Sm 2:35 I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his house, and he will minister before my anointed one always.
091Sm 2:36 Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead, "Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat."'"
091Sm 3:1 The boy Samuel ministered before the LORD under Eli. In those days the word of the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.
091Sm 3:2 One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place.
091Sm 3:3 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.
091Sm 3:4 Then the LORD called Samuel. Samuel answered, "Here I am."
091Sm 3:5 And he ran to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." But Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down." So he went and lay down.
091Sm 3:6 Again the LORD called, "Samuel!" And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." "My son," Eli said, "I did not call; go back and lie down."
091Sm 3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD£º The word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.
091Sm 3:8 The LORD called Samuel a third time, and Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am; you called me." Then Eli realized that the LORD was calling the boy.
091Sm 3:9 So Eli told Samuel, "Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
091Sm 3:10 The LORD came and stood there, calling as at the other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" Then Samuel said, "Speak, for your servant is listening."
091Sm 3:11 And the LORD said to Samuel£º "See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.
091Sm 3:12 At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family--from beginning to end.
091Sm 3:13 For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons made themselves contemptible, and he failed to restrain them.
091Sm 3:14 Therefore, I swore to the house of Eli, 'The guilt of Eli's house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.'"
091Sm 3:15 Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,
091Sm 3:16 but Eli called him and said, "Samuel, my son." Samuel answered, "Here I am."
091Sm 3:17 "What was it he said to you?" Eli asked. "Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you."
091Sm 3:18 So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, "He is the LORD; let him do what is good in his eyes."
091Sm 3:19 The LORD was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of his words fall to the ground.
091Sm 3:20 And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the LORD.
091Sm 3:21 The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word.
091Sm 4:1 And Samuel's word came to all Israel. Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek.
091Sm 4:2 The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield.
091Sm 4:3 When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the LORD bring defeat upon us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the LORD'S covenant from Shiloh, so that it may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies."
091Sm 4:4 So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
091Sm 4:5 When the ark of the LORD'S covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.
091Sm 4:6 Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, "What's all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?" When they learned that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp,
091Sm 4:7 the Philistines were afraid. "A god has come into the camp," they said. "We're in trouble! Nothing like this has happened before.
091Sm 4:8 Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the desert.
091Sm 4:9 Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!"
091Sm 4:10 So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers.
091Sm 4:11 The ark of God was captured, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
091Sm 4:12 That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh, his clothes torn and dust on his head.
091Sm 4:13 When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry.
091Sm 4:14 Eli heard the outcry and asked, "What is the meaning of this uproar?" The man hurried over to Eli,
091Sm 4:15 who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes were set so that he could not see.
091Sm 4:16 He told Eli, "I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day." Eli asked, "What happened, my son?"
091Sm 4:17 The man who brought the news replied, "Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."
091Sm 4:18 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man and heavy. He had led Israel forty years.
091Sm 4:19 His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains.
091Sm 4:20 As she was dying, the women attending her said, "Don't despair; you have given birth to a son." But she did not respond or pay any attention.
091Sm 4:21 She named the boy Ichabod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel"--because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.
091Sm 4:22 She said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."
091Sm 5:1 After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.
091Sm 5:2 Then they carried the ark into Dagon's temple and set it beside Dagon.
091Sm 5:3 When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD! They took Dagon and put him back in his place.
091Sm 5:4 But the following morning when they rose, there was Dagon, fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD! His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his body remained.
091Sm 5:5 That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor any others who enter Dagon's temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.
091Sm 5:6 The LORD'S hand was heavy upon the people of Ashdod and its vicinity; he brought devastation upon them and afflicted them with tumors.
091Sm 5:7 When the men of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, "The ark of the god of Israel must not stay here with us, because his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god."
091Sm 5:8 So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and asked them, "What shall we do with the ark of the god of Israel?" They answered, "Have the ark of the god of Israel moved to Gath." So they moved the ark of the God of Israel.
091Sm 5:9 But after they had moved it, the LORD'S hand was against that city, throwing it into a great panic. He afflicted the people of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors.
091Sm 5:10 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. As the ark of God was entering Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought the ark of the god of Israel around to us to kill us and our people."
091Sm 5:11 So they called together all the rulers of the Philistines and said, "Send the ark of the god of Israel away; let it go back to its own place, or it will kill us and our people." For death had filled the city with panic; God's hand was very heavy upon it.
091Sm 5:12 Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
091Sm 6:1 When the ark of the LORD had been in Philistine territory seven months,
091Sm 6:2 the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us how we should send it back to its place."
091Sm 6:3 They answered, "If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it away empty, but by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you."
091Sm 6:4 The Philistines asked, "What guilt offering should we send to him?" They replied, "Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers.
091Sm 6:5 Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and pay honor to Israel's god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land.
091Sm 6:6 Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When he treated them harshly, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?
091Sm 6:7 "Now then, get a new cart ready, with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.
091Sm 6:8 Take the ark of the LORD and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way,
091Sm 6:9 but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the LORD has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us and that it happened to us by chance."
091Sm 6:10 So they did this. They took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves.
091Sm 6:11 They placed the ark of the LORD on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors.
091Sm 6:12 Then the cows went straight up toward Beth Shemesh, keeping on the road and lowing all the way; they did not turn to the right or to the left. The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.
091Sm 6:13 Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight.
091Sm 6:14 The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, and there it stopped beside a large rock. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.
091Sm 6:15 The Levites took down the ark of the LORD, together with the chest containing the gold objects, and placed them on the large rock. On that day the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the LORD.
091Sm 6:16 The five rulers of the Philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to Ekron.
091Sm 6:17 These are the gold tumors the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the LORD--one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron.
091Sm 6:18 And the number of the gold rats was according to the number of Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers--the fortified towns with their country villages. The large rock, on which they set the ark of the LORD, is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.
091Sm 6:19 But God struck down some of the men of Beth Shemesh, putting seventy of them to death because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. The people mourned because of the heavy blow the LORD had dealt them,
091Sm 6:20 and the men of Beth Shemesh asked, "Who can stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God? To whom will the ark go up from here?"
091Sm 6:21 Then they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim, saying, "The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to your place."
091Sm 7:1 So the men of Kiriath Jearim came and took up the ark of the LORD. They took it to Abinadab's house on the hill and consecrated Eleazar his son to guard the ark of the LORD.
091Sm 7:2 It was a long time, twenty years in all, that the ark remained at Kiriath Jearim, and all the people of Israel mourned and sought after the LORD.
091Sm 7:3 And Samuel said to the whole house of Israel, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your hearts, then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the LORD and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."
091Sm 7:4 So the Israelites put away their Baals and Ashtoreths, and served the LORD only.
091Sm 7:5 Then Samuel said, "Assemble all Israel at Mizpah and I will intercede with the LORD for you."
091Sm 7:6 When they had assembled at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the LORD. On that day they fasted and there they confessed, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel was leader of Israel at Mizpah.
091Sm 7:7 When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, the rulers of the Philistines came up to attack them. And when the Israelites heard of it, they were afraid because of the Philistines.
091Sm 7:8 They said to Samuel, "Do not stop crying out to the LORD our God for us, that he may rescue us from the hand of the Philistines."
091Sm 7:9 Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. He cried out to the LORD on Israel's behalf, and the LORD answered him.
091Sm 7:10 While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the LORD thundered with loud thunder against the Philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the Israelites.
091Sm 7:11 The men of Israel rushed out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, slaughtering them along the way to a point below Beth Car.
091Sm 7:12 Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named it Ebenezer, saying, "Thus far has the LORD helped us."
091Sm 7:13 So the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israelite territory again. Throughout Samuel's lifetime, the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines.
091Sm 7:14 The towns from Ekron to Gath that the Philistines had captured from Israel were restored to her, and Israel delivered the neighboring territory from the power of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
091Sm 7:15 Samuel continued as judge over Israel all the days of his life.
091Sm 7:16 From year to year he went on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.
091Sm 7:17 But he always went back to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also judged Israel. And he built an altar there to the LORD.
091Sm 8:1 When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges for Israel.
091Sm 8:2 The name of his firstborn was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah, and they served at Beersheba.
091Sm 8:3 But his sons did not walk in his ways. They turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice.
091Sm 8:4 So all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.
091Sm 8:5 They said to him, "You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have."
091Sm 8:6 But when they said, "Give us a king to lead us," this displeased Samuel; so he prayed to the LORD.
091Sm 8:7 And the LORD told him£º "Listen to all that the people are saying to you; it is not you they have rejected, but they have rejected me as their king.
091Sm 8:8 As they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day, forsaking me and serving other gods, so they are doing to you.
091Sm 8:9 Now listen to them; but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will do."
091Sm 8:10 Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king.
091Sm 8:11 He said, "This is what the king who will reign over you will do£º He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses, and they will run in front of his chariots.
091Sm 8:12 Some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest, and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.
091Sm 8:13 He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.
091Sm 8:14 He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants.
091Sm 8:15 He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants.
091Sm 8:16 Your menservants and maidservants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use.
091Sm 8:17 He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.
091Sm 8:18 When that day comes, you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen, and the LORD will not answer you in that day."
091Sm 8:19 But the people refused to listen to Samuel. "No!" they said. "We want a king over us.
091Sm 8:20 Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles."
091Sm 8:21 When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the LORD.
091Sm 8:22 The LORD answered, "Listen to them and give them a king." Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, "Everyone go back to his town."
091Sm 9:1 There was a Benjamite, a man of standing, whose name was Kish son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.
091Sm 9:2 He had a son named Saul, an impressive young man without equal among the Israelites--a head taller than any of the others.
091Sm 9:3 Now the donkeys belonging to Saul's father Kish were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys."
091Sm 9:4 So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the area around Shalisha, but they did not find them. They went on into the district of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then he passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.
091Sm 9:5 When they reached the district of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, "Come, let's go back, or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us."
091Sm 9:6 But the servant replied, "Look, in this town there is a man of God; he is highly respected, and everything he says comes true. Let's go there now. Perhaps he will tell us what way to take."
091Sm 9:7 Saul said to his servant, "If we go, what can we give the man? The food in our sacks is gone. We have no gift to take to the man of God. What do we have?"
091Sm 9:8 The servant answered him again. "Look," he said, "I have a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God so that he will tell us what way to take."
091Sm 9:9 (Formerly in Israel, if a man went to inquire of God, he would say, "Come, let us go to the seer," because the prophet of today used to be called a seer.)
091Sm 9:10 "Good," Saul said to his servant. "Come, let's go." So they set out for the town where the man of God was.
091Sm 9:11 As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some girls coming out to draw water, and they asked them, "Is the seer here?"
091Sm 9:12 "He is," they answered. "He's ahead of you. Hurry now; he has just come to our town today, for the people have a sacrifice at the high place.
091Sm 9:13 As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people will not begin eating until he comes, because he must bless the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. Go up now; you should find him about this time."
091Sm 9:14 They went up to the town, and as they were entering it, there was Samuel, coming toward them on his way up to the high place.
091Sm 9:15 Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed this to Samuel£º
091Sm 9:16 "About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him leader over my people Israel; he will deliver my people from the hand of the Philistines. I have looked upon my people, for their cry has reached me."
091Sm 9:17 When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD said to him, "This is the man I spoke to you about; he will govern my people."
091Sm 9:18 Saul approached Samuel in the gateway and asked, "Would you please tell me where the seer's house is?"
091Sm 9:19 "I am the seer," Samuel replied. "Go up ahead of me to the high place, for today you are to eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart.
091Sm 9:20 As for the donkeys you lost three days ago, do not worry about them; they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and all your father's family?"
091Sm 9:21 Saul answered, "But am I not a Benjamite, from the smallest tribe of Israel, and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why do you say such a thing to me?"
091Sm 9:22 Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited--about thirty in number.
091Sm 9:23 Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the piece of meat I gave you, the one I told you to lay aside."
091Sm 9:24 So the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Samuel said, "Here is what has been kept for you. Eat, because it was set aside for you for this occasion, from the time I said, 'I have invited guests.'" And Saul dined with Samuel that day.
091Sm 9:25 After they came down from the high place to the town, Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house.
091Sm 9:26 They rose about daybreak and Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get ready, and I will send you on your way." When Saul got ready, he and Samuel went outside together.
091Sm 9:27 As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us"--and the servant did so--"but you stay here awhile, so that I may give you a message from God."
091Sm 10:1 Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on Saul's head and kissed him, saying, "Has not the LORD anointed you leader over his inheritance?
091Sm 10:2 When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb, at Zelzah on the border of Benjamin. They will say to you, 'The donkeys you set out to look for have been found. And now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you. He is asking, "What shall I do about my son?"'
091Sm 10:3 "Then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there. One will be carrying three young goats, another three loaves of bread, and another a skin of wine.
091Sm 10:4 They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from them.
091Sm 10:5 "After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, tambourines, flutes and harps being played before them, and they will be prophesying.
091Sm 10:6 The Spirit of the LORD will come upon you in power, and you will prophesy with them; and you will be changed into a different person.
091Sm 10:7 Once these signs are fulfilled, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.
091Sm 10:8 "Go down ahead of me to Gilgal. I will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, but you must wait seven days until I come to you and tell you what you are to do."
091Sm 10:9 As Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul's heart, and all these signs were fulfilled that day.
091Sm 10:10 When they arrived at Gibeah, a procession of prophets met him; the Spirit of God came upon him in power, and he joined in their prophesying.
091Sm 10:11 When all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, "What is this that has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"
091Sm 10:12 A man who lived there answered, "And who is their father?" So it became a saying£º "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
091Sm 10:13 After Saul stopped prophesying, he went to the high place.
091Sm 10:14 Now Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, "Where have you been?" "Looking for the donkeys," he said. "But when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."
091Sm 10:15 Saul's uncle said, "Tell me what Samuel said to you."
091Sm 10:16 Saul replied, "He assured us that the donkeys had been found." But he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.
091Sm 10:17 Samuel summoned the people of Israel to the LORD at Mizpah
091Sm 10:18 and said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º 'I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the power of Egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you.'
091Sm 10:19 But you have now rejected your God, who saves you out of all your calamities and distresses. And you have said, 'No, set a king over us.' So now present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and clans."
091Sm 10:20 When Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen.
091Sm 10:21 Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin, clan by clan, and Matri's clan was chosen. Finally Saul son of Kish was chosen. But when they looked for him, he was not to be found.
091Sm 10:22 So they inquired further of the LORD, "Has the man come here yet?" And the LORD said, "Yes, he has hidden himself among the baggage."
091Sm 10:23 They ran and brought him out, and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others.
091Sm 10:24 Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the man the LORD has chosen? There is no one like him among all the people." Then the people shouted, "Long live the king!"
091Sm 10:25 Samuel explained to the people the regulations of the kingship. He wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the LORD. Then Samuel dismissed the people, each to his own home.
091Sm 10:26 Saul also went to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by valiant men whose hearts God had touched.
091Sm 10:27 But some troublemakers said, "How can this fellow save us?" They despised him and brought him no gifts. But Saul kept silent.
091Sm 11:1 Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh Gilead. And all the men of Jabesh said to him, "Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you."
091Sm 11:2 But Nahash the Ammonite replied, "I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel."
091Sm 11:3 The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you."
091Sm 11:4 When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud.
091Sm 11:5 Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, "What is wrong with the people? Why are they weeping?" Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said.
091Sm 11:6 When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came upon him in power, and he burned with anger.
091Sm 11:7 He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, "This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel." Then the terror of the LORD fell on the people, and they turned out as one man.
091Sm 11:8 When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
091Sm 11:9 They told the messengers who had come, "Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, 'By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be delivered.'" When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated.
091Sm 11:10 They said to the Ammonites, "Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever seems good to you."
091Sm 11:11 The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.
091Sm 11:12 The people then said to Samuel, "Who was it that asked, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring these men to us and we will put them to death."
091Sm 11:13 But Saul said, "No one shall be put to death today, for this day the LORD has rescued Israel."
091Sm 11:14 Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal and there reaffirm the kingship."
091Sm 11:15 So all the people went to Gilgal and confirmed Saul as king in the presence of the LORD. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the LORD, and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration.
091Sm 12:1 Samuel said to all Israel, "I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you.
091Sm 12:2 Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day.
091Sm 12:3 Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the LORD and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these, I will make it right."
091Sm 12:4 "You have not cheated or oppressed us," they replied. "You have not taken anything from anyone's hand."
091Sm 12:5 Samuel said to them, "The LORD is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand." "He is witness," they said.
091Sm 12:6 Then Samuel said to the people, "It is the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your forefathers up out of Egypt.
091Sm 12:7 Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the LORD as to all the righteous acts performed by the LORD for you and your fathers.
091Sm 12:8 "After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the LORD for help, and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your forefathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place.
091Sm 12:9 "But they forgot the LORD their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them.
091Sm 12:10 They cried out to the LORD and said, 'We have sinned; we have forsaken the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.'
091Sm 12:11 Then the LORD sent Jerub-Baal, Barak, Jephthah and Samuel, and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side, so that you lived securely.
091Sm 12:12 "But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, 'No, we want a king to rule over us'--even though the LORD your God was your king.
091Sm 12:13 Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the LORD has set a king over you.
091Sm 12:14 If you fear the LORD and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the LORD your God--good!
091Sm 12:15 But if you do not obey the LORD, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your fathers.
091Sm 12:16 "Now then, stand still and see this great thing the LORD is about to do before your eyes!
091Sm 12:17 Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call upon the LORD to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the LORD when you asked for a king."
091Sm 12:18 Then Samuel called upon the LORD, and that same day the LORD sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the LORD and of Samuel.
091Sm 12:19 The people all said to Samuel, "Pray to the LORD your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king."
091Sm 12:20 "Do not be afraid," Samuel replied. "You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart.
091Sm 12:21 Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless.
091Sm 12:22 For the sake of his great name the LORD will not reject his people, because the LORD was pleased to make you his own.
091Sm 12:23 As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right.
091Sm 12:24 But be sure to fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you.
091Sm 12:25 Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away."
091Sm 13:1 Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty- two years.
091Sm 13:2 Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Micmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes.
091Sm 13:3 Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, "Let the Hebrews hear!"
091Sm 13:4 So all Israel heard the news£º "Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines." And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
091Sm 13:5 The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Micmash, east of Beth Aven.
091Sm 13:6 When the men of Israel saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns.
091Sm 13:7 Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear.
091Sm 13:8 He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul's men began to scatter.
091Sm 13:9 So he said, "Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings." And Saul offered up the burnt offering.
091Sm 13:10 Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.
091Sm 13:11 "What have you done?" asked Samuel. Saul replied, "When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Micmash,
091Sm 13:12 I thought, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the LORD'S favor.' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering."
091Sm 13:13 "You acted foolishly," Samuel said. "You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.
091Sm 13:14 But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD'S command."
091Sm 13:15 Then Samuel left Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred.
091Sm 13:16 Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Micmash.
091Sm 13:17 Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual,
091Sm 13:18 another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the desert.
091Sm 13:19 Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!"
091Sm 13:20 So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plowshares, mattocks, axes and sickles sharpened.
091Sm 13:21 The price was two thirds of a shekel for sharpening plowshares and mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads.
091Sm 13:22 So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
091Sm 13:23 Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Micmash.
091Sm 14:1 One day Jonathan son of Saul said to the young man bearing his armor, "Come, let's go over to the Philistine outpost on the other side." But he did not tell his father.
091Sm 14:2 Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron. With him were about six hundred men,
091Sm 14:3 among whom was Ahijah, who was wearing an ephod. He was a son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh. No one was aware that Jonathan had left.
091Sm 14:4 On each side of the pass that Jonathan intended to cross to reach the Philistine outpost was a cliff; one was called Bozez, and the other Seneh.
091Sm 14:5 One cliff stood to the north toward Micmash, the other to the south toward Geba.
091Sm 14:6 Jonathan said to his young armor-bearer, "Come, let's go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised fellows. Perhaps the LORD will act in our behalf. Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few."
091Sm 14:7 "Do all that you have in mind," his armor-bearer said. "Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul."
091Sm 14:8 Jonathan said, "Come, then; we will cross over toward the men and let them see us.
091Sm 14:9 If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come to you,' we will stay where we are and not go up to them.
091Sm 14:10 But if they say, 'Come up to us,' we will climb up, because that will be our sign that the LORD has given them into our hands."
091Sm 14:11 So both of them showed themselves to the Philistine outpost. "Look!" said the Philistines. "The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in."
091Sm 14:12 The men of the outpost shouted to Jonathan and his armor-bearer, "Come up to us and we'll teach you a lesson." So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Climb up after me; the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."
091Sm 14:13 Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer right behind him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer followed and killed behind him.
091Sm 14:14 In that first attack Jonathan and his armor-bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre.
091Sm 14:15 Then panic struck the whole army--those in the camp and field, and those in the outposts and raiding parties--and the ground shook. It was a panic sent by God.
091Sm 14:16 Saul's lookouts at Gibeah in Benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions.
091Sm 14:17 Then Saul said to the men who were with him, "Muster the forces and see who has left us." When they did, it was Jonathan and his armor-bearer who were not there.
091Sm 14:18 Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the ark of God." (At that time it was with the Israelites.)
091Sm 14:19 While Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the Philistine camp increased more and more. So Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."
091Sm 14:20 Then Saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle. They found the Philistines in total confusion, striking each other with their swords.
091Sm 14:21 Those Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.
091Sm 14:22 When all the Israelites who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were on the run, they joined the battle in hot pursuit.
091Sm 14:23 So the LORD rescued Israel that day, and the battle moved on beyond Beth Aven.
091Sm 14:24 Now the men of Israel were in distress that day, because Saul had bound the people under an oath, saying, "Cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes, before I have avenged myself on my enemies!" So none of the troops tasted food.
091Sm 14:25 The entire army entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground.
091Sm 14:26 When they went into the woods, they saw the honey oozing out, yet no one put his hand to his mouth, because they feared the oath.
091Sm 14:27 But Jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath, so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb. He raised his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.
091Sm 14:28 Then one of the soldiers told him, "Your father bound the army under a strict oath, saying, 'Cursed be any man who eats food today!' That is why the men are faint."
091Sm 14:29 Jonathan said, "My father has made trouble for the country. See how my eyes brightened when I tasted a little of this honey.
091Sm 14:30 How much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies. Would not the slaughter of the Philistines have been even greater?"
091Sm 14:31 That day, after the Israelites had struck down the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon, they were exhausted.
091Sm 14:32 They pounced on the plunder and, taking sheep, cattle and calves, they butchered them on the ground and ate them, together with the blood.
091Sm 14:33 Then someone said to Saul, "Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that has blood in it." "You have broken faith," he said. "Roll a large stone over here at once."
091Sm 14:34 Then he said, "Go out among the men and tell them, 'Each of you bring me your cattle and sheep, and slaughter them here and eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with blood still in it.'" So everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there.
091Sm 14:35 Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first time he had done this.
091Sm 14:36 Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them till dawn, and let us not leave one of them alive." "Do whatever seems best to you," they replied. But the priest said, "Let us inquire of God here."
091Sm 14:37 So Saul asked God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will you give them into Israel's hand?" But God did not answer him that day.
091Sm 14:38 Saul therefore said, "Come here, all you who are leaders of the army, and let us find out what sin has been committed today.
091Sm 14:39 As surely as the LORD who rescues Israel lives, even if it lies with my son Jonathan, he must die." But not one of the men said a word.
091Sm 14:40 Saul then said to all the Israelites, "You stand over there; I and Jonathan my son will stand over here." "Do what seems best to you," the men replied.
091Sm 14:41 Then Saul prayed to the LORD, the God of Israel, "Give me the right answer." And Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, and the men were cleared.
091Sm 14:42 Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was taken.
091Sm 14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." So Jonathan told him, "I merely tasted a little honey with the end of my staff. And now must I die?"
091Sm 14:44 Saul said, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you do not die, Jonathan."
091Sm 14:45 But the men said to Saul, "Should Jonathan die--he who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Never! As surely as the LORD lives, not a hair of his head will fall to the ground, for he did this today with God's help." So the men rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.
091Sm 14:46 Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they withdrew to their own land.
091Sm 14:47 After Saul had assumed rule over Israel, he fought against their enemies on every side£º Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment on them.
091Sm 14:48 He fought valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, delivering Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.
091Sm 14:49 Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi and Malki-Shua. The name of his older daughter was Merab, and that of the younger was Michal.
091Sm 14:50 His wife's name was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of Saul's army was Abner son of Ner, and Ner was Saul's uncle.
091Sm 14:51 Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel.
091Sm 14:52 All the days of Saul there was bitter war with the Philistines, and whenever Saul saw a mighty or brave man, he took him into his service.
091Sm 15:1 Samuel said to Saul, "I am the one the LORD sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the LORD.
091Sm 15:2 This is what the LORD Almighty says£º 'I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt.
091Sm 15:3 Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'"
091Sm 15:4 So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim--two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah.
091Sm 15:5 Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine.
091Sm 15:6 Then he said to the Kenites, "Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt." So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
091Sm 15:7 Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, to the east of Egypt.
091Sm 15:8 He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword.
091Sm 15:9 But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves and lambs--everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed.
091Sm 15:10 Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel£º
091Sm 15:11 "I am grieved that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions." Samuel was troubled, and he cried out to the LORD all that night.
091Sm 15:12 Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, "Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal."
091Sm 15:13 When Samuel reached him, Saul said, "The LORD bless you! I have carried out the LORD'S instructions."
091Sm 15:14 But Samuel said, "What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?"
091Sm 15:15 Saul answered, "The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the LORD your God, but we totally destroyed the rest."
091Sm 15:16 "Stop!" Samuel said to Saul. "Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night." "Tell me," Saul replied.
091Sm 15:17 Samuel said, "Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The LORD anointed you king over Israel.
091Sm 15:18 And he sent you on a mission, saying, 'Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; make war on them until you have wiped them out.'
091Sm 15:19 Why did you not obey the LORD? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the LORD?"
091Sm 15:20 "But I did obey the LORD," Saul said. "I went on the mission the LORD assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king.
091Sm 15:21 The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the LORD your God at Gilgal."
091Sm 15:22 But Samuel replied£º "Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD? To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.
091Sm 15:23 For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king."
091Sm 15:24 Then Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned. I violated the LORD'S command and your instructions. I was afraid of the people and so I gave in to them.
091Sm 15:25 Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD."
091Sm 15:26 But Samuel said to him, "I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you as king over Israel!"
091Sm 15:27 As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore.
091Sm 15:28 Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors--to one better than you.
091Sm 15:29 He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind."
091Sm 15:30 Saul replied, "I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God."
091Sm 15:31 So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.
091Sm 15:32 Then Samuel said, "Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites." Agag came to him confidently, thinking, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."
091Sm 15:33 But Samuel said, "As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women." And Samuel put Agag to death before the LORD at Gilgal.
091Sm 15:34 Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul.
091Sm 15:35 Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the LORD was grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.
091Sm 16:1 The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king."
091Sm 16:2 But Samuel said, "How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me." The LORD said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the LORD.'
091Sm 16:3 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate."
091Sm 16:4 Samuel did what the LORD said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, "Do you come in peace?"
091Sm 16:5 Samuel replied, "Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me." Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.
091Sm 16:6 When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the LORD'S anointed stands here before the LORD."
091Sm 16:7 But the LORD said to Samuel, "Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."
091Sm 16:8 Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, "The LORD has not chosen this one either."
091Sm 16:9 Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, "Nor has the LORD chosen this one."
091Sm 16:10 Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, "The LORD has not chosen these."
091Sm 16:11 So he asked Jesse, "Are these all the sons you have?" "There is still the youngest," Jesse answered, "but he is tending the sheep." Samuel said, "Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives."
091Sm 16:12 So he sent and had him brought in. He was ruddy, with a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the LORD said, "Rise and anoint him; he is the one."
091Sm 16:13 So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came upon David in power. Samuel then went to Ramah.
091Sm 16:14 Now the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD tormented him.
091Sm 16:15 Saul's attendants said to him, "See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.
091Sm 16:16 Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the harp. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes upon you, and you will feel better."
091Sm 16:17 So Saul said to his attendants, "Find someone who plays well and bring him to me."
091Sm 16:18 One of the servants answered, "I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the harp. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the LORD is with him."
091Sm 16:19 Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep."
091Sm 16:20 So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul.
091Sm 16:21 David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers.
091Sm 16:22 Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, "Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with him."
091Sm 16:23 Whenever the spirit from God came upon Saul, David would take his harp and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.
091Sm 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Socoh in Judah. They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah.
091Sm 17:2 Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to meet the Philistines.
091Sm 17:3 The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them.
091Sm 17:4 A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. He was over nine feet tall.
091Sm 17:5 He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels;
091Sm 17:6 on his legs he wore bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back.
091Sm 17:7 His spear shaft was like a weaver's rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went ahead of him.
091Sm 17:8 Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, "Why do you come out and line up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man and have him come down to me.
091Sm 17:9 If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and serve us."
091Sm 17:10 Then the Philistine said, "This day I defy the ranks of Israel! Give me a man and let us fight each other."
091Sm 17:11 On hearing the Philistine's words, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and terrified.
091Sm 17:12 Now David was the son of an Ephrathite named Jesse, who was from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and in Saul's time he was old and well advanced in years.
091Sm 17:13 Jesse's three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war£º The firstborn was Eliab; the second, Abinadab; and the third, Shammah.
091Sm 17:14 David was the youngest. The three oldest followed Saul,
091Sm 17:15 but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
091Sm 17:16 For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand.
091Sm 17:17 Now Jesse said to his son David, "Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp.
091Sm 17:18 Take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit. See how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them.
091Sm 17:19 They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines."
091Sm 17:20 Early in the morning David left the flock with a shepherd, loaded up and set out, as Jesse had directed. He reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions, shouting the war cry.
091Sm 17:21 Israel and the Philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other.
091Sm 17:22 David left his things with the keeper of supplies, ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers.
091Sm 17:23 As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance, and David heard it.
091Sm 17:24 When the Israelites saw the man, they all ran from him in great fear.
091Sm 17:25 Now the Israelites had been saying, "Do you see how this man keeps coming out? He comes out to defy Israel. The king will give great wealth to the man who kills him. He will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his father's family from taxes in Israel."
091Sm 17:26 David asked the men standing near him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
091Sm 17:27 They repeated to him what they had been saying and told him, "This is what will be done for the man who kills him."
091Sm 17:28 When Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard him speaking with the men, he burned with anger at him and asked, "Why have you come down here? And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert? I know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is; you came down only to watch the battle."
091Sm 17:29 "Now what have I done?" said David. "Can't I even speak?"
091Sm 17:30 He then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter, and the men answered him as before.
091Sm 17:31 What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, and Saul sent for him.
091Sm 17:32 David said to Saul, "Let no one lose heart on account of this Philistine; your servant will go and fight him."
091Sm 17:33 Saul replied, "You are not able to go out against this Philistine and fight him; you are only a boy, and he has been a fighting man from his youth."
091Sm 17:34 But David said to Saul, "Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep. When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock,
091Sm 17:35 I went after it, struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth. When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair, struck it and killed it.
091Sm 17:36 Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, because he has defied the armies of the living God.
091Sm 17:37 The LORD who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and the LORD be with you."
091Sm 17:38 Then Saul dressed David in his own tunic. He put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head.
091Sm 17:39 David fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around, because he was not used to them. "I cannot go in these," he said to Saul, "because I am not used to them." So he took them off.
091Sm 17:40 Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd's bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.
091Sm 17:41 Meanwhile, the Philistine, with his shield bearer in front of him, kept coming closer to David.
091Sm 17:42 He looked David over and saw that he was only a boy, ruddy and handsome, and he despised him.
091Sm 17:43 He said to David, "Am I a dog, that you come at me with sticks?" And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
091Sm 17:44 "Come here," he said, "and I'll give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!"
091Sm 17:45 David said to the Philistine, "You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
091Sm 17:46 This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I'll strike you down and cut off your head. Today I will give the carcasses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel.
091Sm 17:47 All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD'S, and he will give all of you into our hands."
091Sm 17:48 As the Philistine moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him.
091Sm 17:49 Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.
091Sm 17:50 So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.
091Sm 17:51 David ran and stood over him. He took hold of the Philistine's sword and drew it from the scabbard. After he killed him, he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.
091Sm 17:52 Then the men of Israel and Judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. Their dead were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron.
091Sm 17:53 When the Israelites returned from chasing the Philistines, they plundered their camp.
091Sm 17:54 David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put the Philistine's weapons in his own tent.
091Sm 17:55 As Saul watched David going out to meet the Philistine, he said to Abner, commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is that young man?" Abner replied, "As surely as you live, O king, I don't know."
091Sm 17:56 The king said, "Find out whose son this young man is."
091Sm 17:57 As soon as David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul, with David still holding the Philistine's head.
091Sm 17:58 "Whose son are you, young man?" Saul asked him. David said, "I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem."
091Sm 18:1 After David had finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved him as himself.
091Sm 18:2 From that day Saul kept David with him and did not let him return to his father's house.
091Sm 18:3 And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.
091Sm 18:4 Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic, and even his sword, his bow and his belt.
091Sm 18:5 Whatever Saul sent him to do, David did it so successfully that Saul gave him a high rank in the army. This pleased all the people, and Saul's officers as well.
091Sm 18:6 When the men were returning home after David had killed the Philistine, the women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul with singing and dancing, with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes.
091Sm 18:7 As they danced, they sang£º "Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands."
091Sm 18:8 Saul was very angry; this refrain galled him. "They have credited David with tens of thousands," he thought, "but me with only thousands. What more can he get but the kingdom?"
091Sm 18:9 And from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.
091Sm 18:10 The next day an evil spirit from God came forcefully upon Saul. He was prophesying in his house, while David was playing the harp, as he usually did. Saul had a spear in his hand
091Sm 18:11 and he hurled it, saying to himself, "I'll pin David to the wall." But David eluded him twice.
091Sm 18:12 Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with David but had left Saul.
091Sm 18:13 So he sent David away from him and gave him command over a thousand men, and David led the troops in their campaigns.
091Sm 18:14 In everything he did he had great success, because the LORD was with him.
091Sm 18:15 When Saul saw how successful he was, he was afraid of him.
091Sm 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he led them in their campaigns.
091Sm 18:17 Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you in marriage; only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the LORD." For Saul said to himself, "I will not raise a hand against him. Let the Philistines do that!"
091Sm 18:18 But David said to Saul, "Who am I, and what is my family or my father's clan in Israel, that I should become the king's son-in-law?"
091Sm 18:19 So when the time came for Merab, Saul's daughter, to be given to David, she was given in marriage to Adriel of Meholah.
091Sm 18:20 Now Saul's daughter Michal was in love with David, and when they told Saul about it, he was pleased.
091Sm 18:21 "I will give her to him," he thought, "so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." So Saul said to David, "Now you have a second opportunity to become my son-in-law."
091Sm 18:22 Then Saul ordered his attendants£º "Speak to David privately and say, 'Look, the king is pleased with you, and his attendants all like you; now become his son-in-law.'"
091Sm 18:23 They repeated these words to David. But David said, "Do you think it is a small matter to become the king's son-in-law? I'm only a poor man and little known."
091Sm 18:24 When Saul's servants told him what David had said,
091Sm 18:25 Saul replied, "Say to David, 'The king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred Philistine foreskins, to take revenge on his enemies.'" Saul's plan was to have David fall by the hands of the Philistines.
091Sm 18:26 When the attendants told David these things, he was pleased to become the king's son-in-law. So before the allotted time elapsed,
091Sm 18:27 David and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. He brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the king's son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.
091Sm 18:28 When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and that his daughter Michal loved David,
091Sm 18:29 Saul became still more afraid of him, and he remained his enemy the rest of his days.
091Sm 18:30 The Philistine commanders continued to go out to battle, and as often as they did, David met with more success than the rest of Saul's officers, and his name became well known.
091Sm 19:1 Saul told his son Jonathan and all the attendants to kill David. But Jonathan was very fond of David
091Sm 19:2 and warned him, "My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Be on your guard tomorrow morning; go into hiding and stay there.
091Sm 19:3 I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are. I'll speak to him about you and will tell you what I find out."
091Sm 19:4 Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Let not the king do wrong to his servant David; he has not wronged you, and what he has done has benefited you greatly.
091Sm 19:5 He took his life in his hands when he killed the Philistine. The LORD won a great victory for all Israel, and you saw it and were glad. Why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like David by killing him for no reason?"
091Sm 19:6 Saul listened to Jonathan and took this oath£º "As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be put to death."
091Sm 19:7 So Jonathan called David and told him the whole conversation. He brought him to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.
091Sm 19:8 Once more war broke out, and David went out and fought the Philistines. He struck them with such force that they fled before him.
091Sm 19:9 But an evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand. While David was playing the harp,
091Sm 19:10 Saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear, but David eluded him as Saul drove the spear into the wall. That night David made good his escape.
091Sm 19:11 Saul sent men to David's house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't run for your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be killed."
091Sm 19:12 So Michal let David down through a window, and he fled and escaped.
091Sm 19:13 Then Michal took an idol and laid it on the bed, covering it with a garment and putting some goats' hair at the head.
091Sm 19:14 When Saul sent the men to capture David, Michal said, "He is ill."
091Sm 19:15 Then Saul sent the men back to see David and told them, "Bring him up to me in his bed so that I may kill him."
091Sm 19:16 But when the men entered, there was the idol in the bed, and at the head was some goats' hair.
091Sm 19:17 Saul said to Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped?" Michal told him, "He said to me, 'Let me get away. Why should I kill you?'"
091Sm 19:18 When David had fled and made his escape, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.
091Sm 19:19 Word came to Saul£º "David is in Naioth at Ramah";
091Sm 19:20 so he sent men to capture him. But when they saw a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there as their leader, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's men and they also prophesied.
091Sm 19:21 Saul was told about it, and he sent more men, and they prophesied too. Saul sent men a third time, and they also prophesied.
091Sm 19:22 Finally, he himself left for Ramah and went to the great cistern at Secu. And he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" "Over in Naioth at Ramah," they said.
091Sm 19:23 So Saul went to Naioth at Ramah. But the Spirit of God came even upon him, and he walked along prophesying until he came to Naioth.
091Sm 19:24 He stripped off his robes and also prophesied in Samuel's presence. He lay that way all that day and night. This is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"
091Sm 20:1 Then David fled from Naioth at Ramah and went to Jonathan and asked, "What have I done? What is my crime? How have I wronged your father, that he is trying to take my life?"
091Sm 20:2 "Never!" Jonathan replied. "You are not going to die! Look, my father doesn't do anything, great or small, without confiding in me. Why would he hide this from me? It's not so!"
091Sm 20:3 But David took an oath and said, "Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes, and he has said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved.' Yet as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, there is only a step between me and death."
091Sm 20:4 Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you want me to do, I'll do for you."
091Sm 20:5 So David said, "Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival, and I am supposed to dine with the king; but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow.
091Sm 20:6 If your father misses me at all, tell him, 'David earnestly asked my permission to hurry to Bethlehem, his hometown, because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan.'
091Sm 20:7 If he says, 'Very well,' then your servant is safe. But if he loses his temper, you can be sure that he is determined to harm me.
091Sm 20:8 As for you, show kindness to your servant, for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the LORD. If I am guilty, then kill me yourself! Why hand me over to your father?"
091Sm 20:9 "Never!" Jonathan said. "If I had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?"
091Sm 20:10 David asked, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"
091Sm 20:11 "Come," Jonathan said, "let's go out into the field." So they went there together.
091Sm 20:12 Then Jonathan said to David£º "By the LORD, the God of Israel, I will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow! If he is favorably disposed toward you, will I not send you word and let you know?
091Sm 20:13 But if my father is inclined to harm you, may the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I do not let you know and send you away safely. May the LORD be with you as he has been with my father.
091Sm 20:14 But show me unfailing kindness like that of the LORD as long as I live, so that I may not be killed,
091Sm 20:15 and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family--not even when the LORD has cut off every one of David's enemies from the face of the earth."
091Sm 20:16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, "May the LORD call David's enemies to account."
091Sm 20:17 And Jonathan had David reaffirm his oath out of love for him, because he loved him as he loved himself.
091Sm 20:18 Then Jonathan said to David£º "Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. You will be missed, because your seat will be empty.
091Sm 20:19 The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid when this trouble began, and wait by the stone Ezel.
091Sm 20:20 I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I were shooting at a target.
091Sm 20:21 Then I will send a boy and say, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I say to him, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; bring them here,' then come, because, as surely as the LORD lives, you are safe; there is no danger.
091Sm 20:22 But if I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then you must go, because the LORD has sent you away.
091Sm 20:23 And about the matter you and I discussed--remember, the LORD is witness between you and me forever."
091Sm 20:24 So David hid in the field, and when the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat.
091Sm 20:25 He sat in his customary place by the wall, opposite Jonathan, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty.
091Sm 20:26 Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, "Something must have happened to David to make him ceremonially unclean--surely he is unclean."
091Sm 20:27 But the next day, the second day of the month, David's place was empty again. Then Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"
091Sm 20:28 Jonathan answered, "David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem.
091Sm 20:29 He said, 'Let me go, because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there. If I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away to see my brothers.' That is why he has not come to the king's table."
091Sm 20:30 Saul's anger flared up at Jonathan and he said to him, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have sided with the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?
091Sm 20:31 As long as the son of Jesse lives on this earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now send and bring him to me, for he must die!"
091Sm 20:32 "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?" Jonathan asked his father.
091Sm 20:33 But Saul hurled his spear at him to kill him. Then Jonathan knew that his father intended to kill David.
091Sm 20:34 Jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger; on that second day of the month he did not eat, because he was grieved at his father's shameful treatment of David.
091Sm 20:35 In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with David. He had a small boy with him,
091Sm 20:36 and he said to the boy, "Run and find the arrows I shoot." As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
091Sm 20:37 When the boy came to the place where Jonathan's arrow had fallen, Jonathan called out after him, "Isn't the arrow beyond you?"
091Sm 20:38 Then he shouted, "Hurry! Go quickly! Don't stop!" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master.
091Sm 20:39 (The boy knew nothing of all this; only Jonathan and David knew.)
091Sm 20:40 Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said, "Go, carry them back to town."
091Sm 20:41 After the boy had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before Jonathan three times, with his face to the ground. Then they kissed each other and wept together--but David wept the most.
091Sm 20:42 Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the LORD, saying, 'The LORD is witness between you and me, and between your descendants and my descendants forever.'" Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town.
091Sm 21:1 David went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he met him, and asked, "Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?"
091Sm 21:2 David answered Ahimelech the priest, "The king charged me with a certain matter and said to me, 'No one is to know anything about your mission and your instructions.' As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place.
091Sm 21:3 Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find."
091Sm 21:4 But the priest answered David, "I don't have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here--provided the men have kept themselves from women."
091Sm 21:5 David replied, "Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever I set out. The men's things are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!"
091Sm 21:6 So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the LORD and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away.
091Sm 21:7 Now one of Saul's servants was there that day, detained before the LORD; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul's head shepherd.
091Sm 21:8 David asked Ahimelech, "Don't you have a spear or a sword here? I haven't brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king's business was urgent."
091Sm 21:9 The priest replied, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one." David said, "There is none like it; give it to me."
091Sm 21:10 That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath.
091Sm 21:11 But the servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, the king of the land? Isn't he the one they sing about in their dances£º "'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"
091Sm 21:12 David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath.
091Sm 21:13 So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard.
091Sm 21:14 Achish said to his servants, "Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me?
091Sm 21:15 Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?"
091Sm 22:1 David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and his father's household heard about it, they went down to him there.
091Sm 22:2 All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
091Sm 22:3 From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, "Would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God will do for me?"
091Sm 22:4 So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was in the stronghold.
091Sm 22:5 But the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not stay in the stronghold. Go into the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
091Sm 22:6 Now Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. And Saul, spear in hand, was seated under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, with all his officials standing around him.
091Sm 22:7 Saul said to them, "Listen, men of Benjamin! Will the son of Jesse give all of you fields and vineyards? Will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
091Sm 22:8 Is that why you have all conspired against me? No one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me, as he does today."
091Sm 22:9 But Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul's officials, said, "I saw the son of Jesse come to Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob.
091Sm 22:10 Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him; he also gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
091Sm 22:11 Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and his father's whole family, who were the priests at Nob, and they all came to the king.
091Sm 22:12 Saul said, "Listen now, son of Ahitub." "Yes, my lord," he answered.
091Sm 22:13 Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me, as he does today?"
091Sm 22:14 Ahimelech answered the king, "Who of all your servants is as loyal as David, the king's son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household?
091Sm 22:15 Was that day the first time I inquired of God for him? Of course not! Let not the king accuse your servant or any of his father's family, for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair."
091Sm 22:16 But the king said, "You will surely die, Ahimelech, you and your father's whole family."
091Sm 22:17 Then the king ordered the guards at his side£º "Turn and kill the priests of the LORD, because they too have sided with David. They knew he was fleeing, yet they did not tell me." But the king's officials were not willing to raise a hand to strike the priests of the LORD.
091Sm 22:18 The king then ordered Doeg, "You turn and strike down the priests." So Doeg the Edomite turned and struck them down. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.
091Sm 22:19 He also put to the sword Nob, the town of the priests, with its men and women, its children and infants, and its cattle, donkeys and sheep.
091Sm 22:20 But Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub, escaped and fled to join David.
091Sm 22:21 He told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD.
091Sm 22:22 Then David said to Abiathar£º "That day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, I knew he would be sure to tell Saul. I am responsible for the death of your father's whole family.
091Sm 22:23 Stay with me; don't be afraid; the man who is seeking your life is seeking mine also. You will be safe with me."
091Sm 23:1 When David was told, "Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are looting the threshing floors,"
091Sm 23:2 he inquired of the LORD, saying, "Shall I go and attack these Philistines?" The LORD answered him, "Go, attack the Philistines and save Keilah."
091Sm 23:3 But David's men said to him, "Here in Judah we are afraid. How much more, then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!"
091Sm 23:4 Once again David inquired of the LORD, and the LORD answered him, "Go down to Keilah, for I am going to give the Philistines into your hand."
091Sm 23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah, fought the Philistines and carried off their livestock. He inflicted heavy losses on the Philistines and saved the people of Keilah.
091Sm 23:6 (Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to David at Keilah.)
091Sm 23:7 Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, "God has handed him over to me, for David has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars."
091Sm 23:8 And Saul called up all his forces for battle, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men.
091Sm 23:9 When David learned that Saul was plotting against him, he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod."
091Sm 23:10 David said, "O LORD, God of Israel, your servant has heard definitely that Saul plans to come to Keilah and destroy the town on account of me.
091Sm 23:11 Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me to him? Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard? O LORD, God of Israel, tell your servant." And the LORD said, "He will."
091Sm 23:12 Again David asked, "Will the citizens of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?" And the LORD said, "They will."
091Sm 23:13 So David and his men, about six hundred in number, left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.
091Sm 23:14 David stayed in the desert strongholds and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Day after day Saul searched for him, but God did not give David into his hands.
091Sm 23:15 While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul had come out to take his life.
091Sm 23:16 And Saul's son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and helped him find strength in God.
091Sm 23:17 "Don't be afraid," he said. "My father Saul will not lay a hand on you. You will be king over Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this."
091Sm 23:18 The two of them made a covenant before the LORD. Then Jonathan went home, but David remained at Horesh.
091Sm 23:19 The Ziphites went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon?
091Sm 23:20 Now, O king, come down whenever it pleases you to do so, and we will be responsible for handing him over to the king."
091Sm 23:21 Saul replied, "The LORD bless you for your concern for me.
091Sm 23:22 Go and make further preparation. Find out where David usually goes and who has seen him there. They tell me he is very crafty.
091Sm 23:23 Find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information. Then I will go with you; if he is in the area, I will track him down among all the clans of Judah."
091Sm 23:24 So they set out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.
091Sm 23:25 Saul and his men began the search, and when David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard this, he went into the Desert of Maon in pursuit of David.
091Sm 23:26 Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side, hurrying to get away from Saul. As Saul and his forces were closing in on David and his men to capture them,
091Sm 23:27 a messenger came to Saul, saying, "Come quickly! The Philistines are raiding the land."
091Sm 23:28 Then Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to meet the Philistines. That is why they call this place Sela Hammahlekoth.
091Sm 23:29 And David went up from there and lived in the strongholds of En Gedi.
091Sm 24:1 After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, "David is in the Desert of En Gedi."
091Sm 24:2 So Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats.
091Sm 24:3 He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave.
091Sm 24:4 The men said, "This is the day the LORD spoke of when he said to you, 'I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.'" Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul's robe.
091Sm 24:5 Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe.
091Sm 24:6 He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the LORD'S anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the LORD."
091Sm 24:7 With these words David rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way.
091Sm 24:8 Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, "My lord the king!" When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.
091Sm 24:9 He said to Saul, "Why do you listen when men say, 'David is bent on harming you'?
091Sm 24:10 This day you have seen with your own eyes how the LORD delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, 'I will not lift my hand against my master, because he is the LORD'S anointed.'
091Sm 24:11 See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. Now understand and recognize that I am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life.
091Sm 24:12 May the LORD judge between you and me. And may the LORD avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you.
091Sm 24:13 As the old saying goes, 'From evildoers come evil deeds,' so my hand will not touch you.
091Sm 24:14 "Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea?
091Sm 24:15 May the LORD be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand."
091Sm 24:16 When David finished saying this, Saul asked, "Is that your voice, David my son?" And he wept aloud.
091Sm 24:17 "You are more righteous than I," he said. "You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly.
091Sm 24:18 You have just now told me of the good you did to me; the LORD delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me.
091Sm 24:19 When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the LORD reward you well for the way you treated me today.
091Sm 24:20 I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands.
091Sm 24:21 Now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father's family."
091Sm 24:22 So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
091Sm 25:1 Now Samuel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned for him; and they buried him at his home in Ramah. Then David moved down into the Desert of Maon.
091Sm 25:2 A certain man in Maon, who had property there at Carmel, was very wealthy. He had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep, which he was shearing in Carmel.
091Sm 25:3 His name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail. She was an intelligent and beautiful woman, but her husband, a Calebite, was surly and mean in his dealings.
091Sm 25:4 While David was in the desert, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep.
091Sm 25:5 So he sent ten young men and said to them, "Go up to Nabal at Carmel and greet him in my name.
091Sm 25:6 Say to him£º 'Long life to you! Good health to you and your household! And good health to all that is yours!
091Sm 25:7 "'Now I hear that it is sheep-shearing time. When your shepherds were with us, we did not mistreat them, and the whole time they were at Carmel nothing of theirs was missing.
091Sm 25:8 Ask your own servants and they will tell you. Therefore be favorable toward my young men, since we come at a festive time. Please give your servants and your son David whatever you can find for them.'"
091Sm 25:9 When David's men arrived, they gave Nabal this message in David's name. Then they waited.
091Sm 25:10 Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is this David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many servants are breaking away from their masters these days.
091Sm 25:11 Why should I take my bread and water, and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men coming from who knows where?"
091Sm 25:12 David's men turned around and went back. When they arrived, they reported every word.
091Sm 25:13 David said to his men, "Put on your swords!" So they put on their swords, and David put on his. About four hundred men went up with David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.
091Sm 25:14 One of the servants told Nabal's wife Abigail£º "David sent messengers from the desert to give our master his greetings, but he hurled insults at them.
091Sm 25:15 Yet these men were very good to us. They did not mistreat us, and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing.
091Sm 25:16 Night and day they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep near them.
091Sm 25:17 Now think it over and see what you can do, because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household. He is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him."
091Sm 25:18 Abigail lost no time. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five dressed sheep, five seahs of roasted grain, a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs, and loaded them on donkeys.
091Sm 25:19 Then she told her servants, "Go on ahead; I'll follow you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.
091Sm 25:20 As she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, there were David and his men descending toward her, and she met them.
091Sm 25:21 David had just said, "It's been useless--all my watching over this fellow's property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing. He has paid me back evil for good.
091Sm 25:22 May God deal with David, be it ever so severely, if by morning I leave alive one male of all who belong to him!"
091Sm 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground.
091Sm 25:24 She fell at his feet and said£º "My lord, let the blame be on me alone. Please let your servant speak to you; hear what your servant has to say.
091Sm 25:25 May my lord pay no attention to that wicked man Nabal. He is just like his name--his name is Fool, and folly goes with him. But as for me, your servant, I did not see the men my master sent.
091Sm 25:26 "Now since the LORD has kept you, my master, from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands, as surely as the LORD lives and as you live, may your enemies and all who intend to harm my master be like Nabal.
091Sm 25:27 And let this gift, which your servant has brought to my master, be given to the men who follow you.
091Sm 25:28 Please forgive your servant's offense, for the LORD will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my master, because he fights the LORD'S battles. Let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live.
091Sm 25:29 Even though someone is pursuing you to take your life, the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the LORD your God. But the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling.
091Sm 25:30 When the LORD has done for my master every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him leader over Israel,
091Sm 25:31 my master will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself. And when the LORD has brought my master success, remember your servant."
091Sm 25:32 David said to Abigail, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you today to meet me.
091Sm 25:33 May you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands.
091Sm 25:34 Otherwise, as surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives, who has kept me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, not one male belonging to Nabal would have been left alive by daybreak."
091Sm 25:35 Then David accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said, "Go home in peace. I have heard your words and granted your request."
091Sm 25:36 When Abigail went to Nabal, he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king. He was in high spirits and very drunk. So she told him nothing until daybreak.
091Sm 25:37 Then in the morning, when Nabal was sober, his wife told him all these things, and his heart failed him and he became like a stone.
091Sm 25:38 About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died.
091Sm 25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise be to the LORD, who has upheld my cause against Nabal for treating me with contempt. He has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought Nabal's wrongdoing down on his own head." Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife.
091Sm 25:40 His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, "David has sent us to you to take you to become his wife."
091Sm 25:41 She bowed down with her face to the ground and said, "Here is your maidservant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master's servants."
091Sm 25:42 Abigail quickly got on a donkey and, attended by her five maids, went with David's messengers and became his wife.
091Sm 25:43 David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both were his wives.
091Sm 25:44 But Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
091Sm 26:1 The Ziphites went to Saul at Gibeah and said, "Is not David hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which faces Jeshimon?"
091Sm 26:2 So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph, with his three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search there for David.
091Sm 26:3 Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah facing Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he saw that Saul had followed him there,
091Sm 26:4 he sent out scouts and learned that Saul had definitely arrived.
091Sm 26:5 Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of the army, had lain down. Saul was lying inside the camp, with the army encamped around him.
091Sm 26:6 David then asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, "Who will go down into the camp with me to Saul?" "I'll go with you," said Abishai.
091Sm 26:7 So David and Abishai went to the army by night, and there was Saul, lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying around him.
091Sm 26:8 Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hands. Now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of my spear; I won't strike him twice."
091Sm 26:9 But David said to Abishai, "Don't destroy him! Who can lay a hand on the LORD'S anointed and be guiltless?
091Sm 26:10 As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "the LORD himself will strike him; either his time will come and he will die, or he will go into battle and perish.
091Sm 26:11 But the LORD forbid that I should lay a hand on the LORD'S anointed. Now get the spear and water jug that are near his head, and let's go."
091Sm 26:12 So David took the spear and water jug near Saul's head, and they left. No one saw or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up. They were all sleeping, because the LORD had put them into a deep sleep.
091Sm 26:13 Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away; there was a wide space between them.
091Sm 26:14 He called out to the army and to Abner son of Ner, "Aren't you going to answer me, Abner?" Abner replied, "Who are you who calls to the king?"
091Sm 26:15 David said, "You're a man, aren't you? And who is like you in Israel? Why didn't you guard your lord the king? Someone came to destroy your lord the king.
091Sm 26:16 What you have done is not good. As surely as the LORD lives, you and your men deserve to die, because you did not guard your master, the LORD'S anointed. Look around you. Where are the king's spear and water jug that were near his head?"
091Sm 26:17 Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is that your voice, David my son?" David replied, "Yes it is, my lord the king."
091Sm 26:18 And he added, "Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done, and what wrong am I guilty of?
091Sm 26:19 Now let my lord the king listen to his servant's words. If the LORD has incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. If, however, men have done it, may they be cursed before the LORD! They have now driven me from my share in the LORD'S inheritance and have said, 'Go, serve other gods.'
091Sm 26:20 Now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the LORD. The king of Israel has come out to look for a flea--as one hunts a partridge in the mountains."
091Sm 26:21 Then Saul said, "I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Because you considered my life precious today, I will not try to harm you again. Surely I have acted like a fool and have erred greatly."
091Sm 26:22 "Here is the king's spear," David answered. "Let one of your young men come over and get it.
091Sm 26:23 The LORD rewards every man for his righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD delivered you into my hands today, but I would not lay a hand on the LORD'S anointed.
091Sm 26:24 As surely as I valued your life today, so may the LORD value my life and deliver me from all trouble."
091Sm 26:25 Then Saul said to David, "May you be blessed, my son David; you will do great things and surely triumph." So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.
091Sm 27:1 But David thought to himself, "One of these days I will be destroyed by the hand of Saul. The best thing I can do is to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me anywhere in Israel, and I will slip out of his hand."
091Sm 27:2 So David and the six hundred men with him left and went over to Achish son of Maoch king of Gath.
091Sm 27:3 David and his men settled in Gath with Achish. Each man had his family with him, and David had his two wives£º Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal.
091Sm 27:4 When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.
091Sm 27:5 Then David said to Achish, "If I have found favor in your eyes, let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns, that I may live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?"
091Sm 27:6 So on that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and it has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.
091Sm 27:7 David lived in Philistine territory a year and four months.
091Sm 27:8 Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites and the Amalekites. (From ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to Shur and Egypt.)
091Sm 27:9 Whenever David attacked an area, he did not leave a man or woman alive, but took sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.
091Sm 27:10 When Achish asked, "Where did you go raiding today?" David would say, "Against the Negev of Judah" or "Against the Negev of Jerahmeel" or "Against the Negev of the Kenites."
091Sm 27:11 He did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to Gath, for he thought, "They might inform on us and say, 'This is what David did.'" And such was his practice as long as he lived in Philistine territory.
091Sm 27:12 Achish trusted David and said to himself, "He has become so odious to his people, the Israelites, that he will be my servant forever."
091Sm 28:1 In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, "You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army."
091Sm 28:2 David said, "Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do." Achish replied, "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life."
091Sm 28:3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land.
091Sm 28:4 The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all the Israelites and set up camp at Gilboa.
091Sm 28:5 When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart.
091Sm 28:6 He inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets.
091Sm 28:7 Saul then said to his attendants, "Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her." "There is one in Endor," they said.
091Sm 28:8 So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. "Consult a spirit for me," he said, "and bring up for me the one I name."
091Sm 28:9 But the woman said to him, "Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?"
091Sm 28:10 Saul swore to her by the LORD, "As surely as the LORD lives, you will not be punished for this."
091Sm 28:11 Then the woman asked, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" "Bring up Samuel," he said.
091Sm 28:12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!"
091Sm 28:13 The king said to her, "Don't be afraid. What do you see?" The woman said, "I see a spirit coming up out of the ground."
091Sm 28:14 "What does he look like?" he asked. "An old man wearing a robe is coming up," she said. Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground.
091Sm 28:15 Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?" "I am in great distress," Saul said. "The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has turned away from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do."
091Sm 28:16 Samuel said, "Why do you consult me, now that the LORD has turned away from you and become your enemy?
091Sm 28:17 The LORD has done what he predicted through me. The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors--to David.
091Sm 28:18 Because you did not obey the LORD or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the LORD has done this to you today.
091Sm 28:19 The LORD will hand over both Israel and you to the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The LORD will also hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines."
091Sm 28:20 Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel's words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and night.
091Sm 28:21 When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, "Look, your maidservant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do.
091Sm 28:22 Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way."
091Sm 28:23 He refused and said, "I will not eat." But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch.
091Sm 28:24 The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast.
091Sm 28:25 Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left.
091Sm 29:1 The Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, and Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel.
091Sm 29:2 As the Philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men were marching at the rear with Achish.
091Sm 29:3 The commanders of the Philistines asked, "What about these Hebrews?" Achish replied, "Is this not David, who was an officer of Saul king of Israel? He has already been with me for over a year, and from the day he left Saul until now, I have found no fault in him."
091Sm 29:4 But the Philistine commanders were angry with him and said, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place you assigned him. He must not go with us into battle, or he will turn against us during the fighting. How better could he regain his master's favor than by taking the heads of our own men?
091Sm 29:5 Isn't this the David they sang about in their dances£º "'Saul has slain his thousands, and David his tens of thousands'?"
091Sm 29:6 So Achish called David and said to him, "As surely as the LORD lives, you have been reliable, and I would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army. From the day you came to me until now, I have found no fault in you, but the rulers don't approve of you.
091Sm 29:7 Turn back and go in peace; do nothing to displease the Philistine rulers."
091Sm 29:8 "But what have I done?" asked David. "What have you found against your servant from the day I came to you until now? Why can't I go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"
091Sm 29:9 Achish answered, "I know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of God; nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, 'He must not go up with us into battle.'
091Sm 29:10 Now get up early, along with your master's servants who have come with you, and leave in the morning as soon as it is light."
091Sm 29:11 So David and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the Philistines, and the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
091Sm 30:1 David and his men reached Ziklag on the third day. Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it,
091Sm 30:2 and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both young and old. They killed none of them, but carried them off as they went on their way.
091Sm 30:3 When David and his men came to Ziklag, they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.
091Sm 30:4 So David and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep.
091Sm 30:5 David's two wives had been captured--Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
091Sm 30:6 David was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him; each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters. But David found strength in the LORD his God.
091Sm 30:7 Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod." Abiathar brought it to him,
091Sm 30:8 and David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue this raiding party? Will I overtake them?" "Pursue them," he answered. "You will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue."
091Sm 30:9 David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Ravine, where some stayed behind,
091Sm 30:10 for two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the ravine. But David and four hundred men continued the pursuit.
091Sm 30:11 They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave him water to drink and food to eat--
091Sm 30:12 part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins. He ate and was revived, for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights.
091Sm 30:13 David asked him, "To whom do you belong, and where do you come from?" He said, "I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. My master abandoned me when I became ill three days ago.
091Sm 30:14 We raided the Negev of the Kerethites and the territory belonging to Judah and the Negev of Caleb. And we burned Ziklag."
091Sm 30:15 David asked him, "Can you lead me down to this raiding party?" He answered, "Swear to me before God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master, and I will take you down to them."
091Sm 30:16 He led David down, and there they were, scattered over the countryside, eating, drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah.
091Sm 30:17 David fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day, and none of them got away, except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled.
091Sm 30:18 David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives.
091Sm 30:19 Nothing was missing£º young or old, boy or girl, plunder or anything else they had taken. David brought everything back.
091Sm 30:20 He took all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock, saying, "This is David's plunder."
091Sm 30:21 Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the Besor Ravine. They came out to meet David and the people with him. As David and his men approached, he greeted them.
091Sm 30:22 But all the evil men and troublemakers among David's followers said, "Because they did not go out with us, we will not share with them the plunder we recovered. However, each man may take his wife and children and go."
091Sm 30:23 David replied, "No, my brothers, you must not do that with what the LORD has given us. He has protected us and handed over to us the forces that came against us.
091Sm 30:24 Who will listen to what you say? The share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle. All will share alike."
091Sm 30:25 David made this a statute and ordinance for Israel from that day to this.
091Sm 30:26 When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends, saying, "Here is a present for you from the plunder of the LORD'S enemies."
091Sm 30:27 He sent it to those who were in Bethel, Ramoth Negev and Jattir;
091Sm 30:28 to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa
091Sm 30:29 and Racal; to those in the towns of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites;
091Sm 30:30 to those in Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach
091Sm 30:31 and Hebron; and to those in all the other places where David and his men had roamed.
091Sm 31:1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa.
091Sm 31:2 The Philistines pressed hard after Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua.
091Sm 31:3 The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him critically.
091Sm 31:4 Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me." But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
091Sm 31:5 When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him.
091Sm 31:6 So Saul and his three sons and his armor-bearer and all his men died together that same day.
091Sm 31:7 When the Israelites along the valley and those across the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them.
091Sm 31:8 The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.
091Sm 31:9 They cut off his head and stripped off his armor, and they sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people.
091Sm 31:10 They put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.
091Sm 31:11 When the people of Jabesh Gilead heard of what the Philistines had done to Saul,
091Sm 31:12 all their valiant men journeyed through the night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and went to Jabesh, where they burned them.
091Sm 31:13 Then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted seven days.
10
102Sm 1:1 After the death of Saul, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days.
102Sm 1:2 On the third day a man arrived from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and with dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor.
102Sm 1:3 "Where have you come from?" David asked him. He answered, "I have escaped from the Israelite camp."
102Sm 1:4 "What happened?" David asked. "Tell me." He said, "The men fled from the battle. Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead."
102Sm 1:5 Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
102Sm 1:6 "I happened to be on Mount Gilboa," the young man said, "and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and riders almost upon him.
102Sm 1:7 When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, 'What can I do?'
102Sm 1:8 "He asked me, 'Who are you?' "'An Amalekite,' I answered.
102Sm 1:9 "Then he said to me, 'Stand over me and kill me! I am in the throes of death, but I'm still alive.'
102Sm 1:10 "So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord."
102Sm 1:11 Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them.
102Sm 1:12 They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the LORD and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.
102Sm 1:13 David said to the young man who brought him the report, "Where are you from?" "I am the son of an alien, an Amalekite," he answered.
102Sm 1:14 David asked him, "Why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?"
102Sm 1:15 Then David called one of his men and said, "Go, strike him down!" So he struck him down, and he died.
102Sm 1:16 For David had said to him, "Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, 'I killed the LORD'S anointed.'"
102Sm 1:17 David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan,
102Sm 1:18 and ordered that the men of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar)£º
102Sm 1:19 "Your glory, O Israel, lies slain on your heights. How the mighty have fallen!
102Sm 1:20 "Tell it not in Gath, proclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines be glad, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.
102Sm 1:21 "O mountains of Gilboa, may you have neither dew nor rain, nor fields that yield offerings of grain. For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul--no longer rubbed with oil.
102Sm 1:22 From the blood of the slain, from the flesh of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, the sword of Saul did not return unsatisfied.
102Sm 1:23 "Saul and Jonathan--in life they were loved and gracious, and in death they were not parted. They were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
102Sm 1:24 "O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you in scarlet and finery, who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.
102Sm 1:25 "How the mighty have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies slain on your heights.
102Sm 1:26 I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, more wonderful than that of women.
102Sm 1:27 "How the mighty have fallen! The weapons of war have perished!"
102Sm 2:1 In the course of time, David inquired of the LORD. "Shall I go up to one of the towns of Judah?" he asked. The LORD said, "Go up." David asked, "Where shall I go?" "To Hebron," the LORD answered.
102Sm 2:2 So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal of Carmel.
102Sm 2:3 David also took the men who were with him, each with his family, and they settled in Hebron and its towns.
102Sm 2:4 Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. When David was told that it was the men of Jabesh Gilead who had buried Saul,
102Sm 2:5 he sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead to say to them, "The LORD bless you for showing this kindness to Saul your master by burying him.
102Sm 2:6 May the LORD now show you kindness and faithfulness, and I too will show you the same favor because you have done this.
102Sm 2:7 Now then, be strong and brave, for Saul your master is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."
102Sm 2:8 Meanwhile, Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-Bosheth son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim.
102Sm 2:9 He made him king over Gilead, Ashuri and Jezreel, and also over Ephraim, Benjamin and all Israel.
102Sm 2:10 Ish-Bosheth son of Saul was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David.
102Sm 2:11 The length of time David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
102Sm 2:12 Abner son of Ner, together with the men of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon.
102Sm 2:13 Joab son of Zeruiah and David's men went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. One group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side.
102Sm 2:14 Then Abner said to Joab, "Let's have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of us." "All right, let them do it," Joab said.
102Sm 2:15 So they stood up and were counted off--twelve men for Benjamin and Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve for David.
102Sm 2:16 Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponent's side, and they fell down together. So that place in Gibeon was called Helkath Hazzurim.
102Sm 2:17 The battle that day was very fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David's men.
102Sm 2:18 The three sons of Zeruiah were there£º Joab, Abishai and Asahel. Now Asahel was as fleet-footed as a wild gazelle.
102Sm 2:19 He chased Abner, turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him.
102Sm 2:20 Abner looked behind him and asked, "Is that you, Asahel?" "It is," he answered.
102Sm 2:21 Then Abner said to him, "Turn aside to the right or to the left; take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons." But Asahel would not stop chasing him.
102Sm 2:22 Again Abner warned Asahel, "Stop chasing me! Why should I strike you down? How could I look your brother Joab in the face?"
102Sm 2:23 But Asahel refused to give up the pursuit; so Abner thrust the butt of his spear into Asahel's stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He fell there and died on the spot. And every man stopped when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.
102Sm 2:24 But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner, and as the sun was setting, they came to the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wasteland of Gibeon.
102Sm 2:25 Then the men of Benjamin rallied behind Abner. They formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill.
102Sm 2:26 Abner called out to Joab, "Must the sword devour forever? Don't you realize that this will end in bitterness? How long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers?"
102Sm 2:27 Joab answered, "As surely as God lives, if you had not spoken, the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning."
102Sm 2:28 So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men came to a halt; they no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore.
102Sm 2:29 All that night Abner and his men marched through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, continued through the whole Bithron and came to Mahanaim.
102Sm 2:30 Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner and assembled all his men. Besides Asahel, nineteen of David's men were found missing.
102Sm 2:31 But David's men had killed three hundred and sixty Benjamites who were with Abner.
102Sm 2:32 They took Asahel and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night and arrived at Hebron by daybreak.
102Sm 3:1 The war between the house of Saul and the house of David lasted a long time. David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.
102Sm 3:2 Sons were born to David in Hebron£º His firstborn was Amnon the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel;
102Sm 3:3 his second, Kileab the son of Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of Maacah daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
102Sm 3:4 the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;
102Sm 3:5 and the sixth, Ithream the son of David's wife Eglah. These were born to David in Hebron.
102Sm 3:6 During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of Saul.
102Sm 3:7 Now Saul had had a concubine named Rizpah daughter of Aiah. And Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, "Why did you sleep with my father's concubine?"
102Sm 3:8 Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said and he answered, "Am I a dog's head--on Judah's side? This very day I am loyal to the house of your father Saul and to his family and friends. I haven't handed you over to David. Yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman!
102Sm 3:9 May God deal with Abner, be it ever so severely, if I do not do for David what the LORD promised him on oath
102Sm 3:10 and transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish David's throne over Israel and Judah from Dan to Beersheba."
102Sm 3:11 Ish-Bosheth did not dare to say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.
102Sm 3:12 Then Abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to David, "Whose land is it? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you bring all Israel over to you."
102Sm 3:13 "Good," said David. "I will make an agreement with you. But I demand one thing of you£º Do not come into my presence unless you bring Michal daughter of Saul when you come to see me."
102Sm 3:14 Then David sent messengers to Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, demanding, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins."
102Sm 3:15 So Ish-Bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.
102Sm 3:16 Her husband, however, went with her, weeping behind her all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, "Go back home!" So he went back.
102Sm 3:17 Abner conferred with the elders of Israel and said, "For some time you have wanted to make David your king.
102Sm 3:18 Now do it! For the LORD promised David, 'By my servant David I will rescue my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.'"
102Sm 3:19 Abner also spoke to the Benjamites in person. Then he went to Hebron to tell David everything that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin wanted to do.
102Sm 3:20 When Abner, who had twenty men with him, came to David at Hebron, David prepared a feast for him and his men.
102Sm 3:21 Then Abner said to David, "Let me go at once and assemble all Israel for my lord the king, so that they may make a compact with you, and that you may rule over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
102Sm 3:22 Just then David's men and Joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder. But Abner was no longer with David in Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.
102Sm 3:23 When Joab and all the soldiers with him arrived, he was told that Abner son of Ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace.
102Sm 3:24 So Joab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Look, Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he is gone!
102Sm 3:25 You know Abner son of Ner; he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing."
102Sm 3:26 Joab then left David and sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know it.
102Sm 3:27 Now when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the gateway, as though to speak with him privately. And there, to avenge the blood of his brother Asahel, Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and he died.
102Sm 3:28 Later, when David heard about this, he said, "I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD concerning the blood of Abner son of Ner.
102Sm 3:29 May his blood fall upon the head of Joab and upon all his father's house! May Joab's house never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food."
102Sm 3:30 (Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)
102Sm 3:31 Then David said to Joab and all the people with him, "Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of Abner." King David himself walked behind the bier.
102Sm 3:32 They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king wept aloud at Abner's tomb. All the people wept also.
102Sm 3:33 The king sang this lament for Abner£º "Should Abner have died as the lawless die?
102Sm 3:34 Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered. You fell as one falls before wicked men." And all the people wept over him again.
102Sm 3:35 Then they all came and urged David to eat something while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, "May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!"
102Sm 3:36 All the people took note and were pleased; indeed, everything the king did pleased them.
102Sm 3:37 So on that day all the people and all Israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of Abner son of Ner.
102Sm 3:38 Then the king said to his men, "Do you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?
102Sm 3:39 And today, though I am the anointed king, I am weak, and these sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds!"
102Sm 4:1 When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel became alarmed.
102Sm 4:2 Now Saul's son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Recab; they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite from the tribe of Benjamin--Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin,
102Sm 4:3 because the people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim and have lived there as aliens to this day.
102Sm 4:4 (Jonathan son of Saul had a son who was lame in both feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she hurried to leave, he fell and became crippled. His name was Mephibosheth.)
102Sm 4:5 Now Recab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out for the house of Ish-Bosheth, and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest.
102Sm 4:6 They went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat, and they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Recab and his brother Baanah slipped away.
102Sm 4:7 They had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom. After they stabbed and killed him, they cut off his head. Taking it with them, they traveled all night by way of the Arabah.
102Sm 4:8 They brought the head of Ish-Bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who tried to take your life. This day the LORD has avenged my lord the king against Saul and his offspring."
102Sm 4:9 David answered Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, "As surely as the LORD lives, who has delivered me out of all trouble,
102Sm 4:10 when a man told me, 'Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and put him to death in Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news!
102Sm 4:11 How much more--when wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed--should I not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you!"
102Sm 4:12 So David gave an order to his men, and they killed them. They cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-Bosheth and buried it in Abner's tomb at Hebron.
102Sm 5:1 All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, "We are your own flesh and blood.
102Sm 5:2 In the past, while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the LORD said to you, 'You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.'"
102Sm 5:3 When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, the king made a compact with them at Hebron before the LORD, and they anointed David king over Israel.
102Sm 5:4 David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years.
102Sm 5:5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.
102Sm 5:6 The king and his men marched to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites, who lived there. The Jebusites said to David, "You will not get in here; even the blind and the lame can ward you off." They thought, "David cannot get in here."
102Sm 5:7 Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, the City of David.
102Sm 5:8 On that day, David said, "Anyone who conquers the Jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those 'lame and blind' who are David's enemies." That is why they say, "The 'blind and lame' will not enter the palace."
102Sm 5:9 David then took up residence in the fortress and called it the City of David. He built up the area around it, from the supporting terraces inward.
102Sm 5:10 And he became more and more powerful, because the LORD God Almighty was with him.
102Sm 5:11 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David.
102Sm 5:12 And David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
102Sm 5:13 After he left Hebron, David took more concubines and wives in Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him.
102Sm 5:14 These are the names of the children born to him there£º Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
102Sm 5:15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
102Sm 5:16 Elishama, Eliada and Eliphelet.
102Sm 5:17 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, they went up in full force to search for him, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.
102Sm 5:18 Now the Philistines had come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim;
102Sm 5:19 so David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD answered him, "Go, for I will surely hand the Philistines over to you."
102Sm 5:20 So David went to Baal Perazim, and there he defeated them. He said, "As waters break out, the LORD has broken out against my enemies before me." So that place was called Baal Perazim.
102Sm 5:21 The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off.
102Sm 5:22 Once more the Philistines came up and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim;
102Sm 5:23 so David inquired of the LORD, and he answered, "Do not go straight up, but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the balsam trees.
102Sm 5:24 As soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, move quickly, because that will mean the LORD has gone out in front of you to strike the Philistine army."
102Sm 5:25 So David did as the LORD commanded him, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
102Sm 6:1 David again brought together out of Israel chosen men, thirty thousand in all.
102Sm 6:2 He and all his men set out from Baalah of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, the name of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on the ark.
102Sm 6:3 They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart
102Sm 6:4 with the ark of God on it, and Ahio was walking in front of it.
102Sm 6:5 David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating with all their might before the LORD, with songs and with harps, lyres, tambourines, sistrums and cymbals.
102Sm 6:6 When they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled.
102Sm 6:7 The LORD'S anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down and he died there beside the ark of God.
102Sm 6:8 Then David was angry because the LORD'S wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.
102Sm 6:9 David was afraid of the LORD that day and said, "How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?"
102Sm 6:10 He was not willing to take the ark of the LORD to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it aside to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
102Sm 6:11 The ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed him and his entire household.
102Sm 6:12 Now King David was told, "The LORD has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he has, because of the ark of God." So David went down and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with rejoicing.
102Sm 6:13 When those who were carrying the ark of the LORD had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.
102Sm 6:14 David, wearing a linen ephod, danced before the LORD with all his might,
102Sm 6:15 while he and the entire house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouts and the sound of trumpets.
102Sm 6:16 As the ark of the LORD was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she despised him in her heart.
102Sm 6:17 They brought the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the LORD.
102Sm 6:18 After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD Almighty.
102Sm 6:19 Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes.
102Sm 6:20 When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, "How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, disrobing in the sight of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!"
102Sm 6:21 David said to Michal, "It was before the LORD, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the LORD'S people Israel--I will celebrate before the LORD.
102Sm 6:22 I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor."
102Sm 6:23 And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death.
102Sm 7:1 After the king was settled in his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him,
102Sm 7:2 he said to Nathan the prophet, "Here I am, living in a palace of cedar, while the ark of God remains in a tent."
102Sm 7:3 Nathan replied to the king, "Whatever you have in mind, go ahead and do it, for the LORD is with you."
102Sm 7:4 That night the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying£º
102Sm 7:5 "Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD says£º Are you the one to build me a house to dwell in?
102Sm 7:6 I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought the Israelites up out of Egypt to this day. I have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling.
102Sm 7:7 Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their rulers whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, "Why have you not built me a house of cedar?" '
102Sm 7:8 "Now then, tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD Almighty says£º I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel.
102Sm 7:9 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you. Now I will make your name great, like the names of the greatest men of the earth.
102Sm 7:10 And I will provide a place for my people Israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed. Wicked people will not oppress them anymore, as they did at the beginning
102Sm 7:11 and have done ever since the time I appointed leaders over my people Israel. I will also give you rest from all your enemies. "'The LORD declares to you that the LORD himself will establish a house for you£º
102Sm 7:12 When your days are over and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom.
102Sm 7:13 He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.
102Sm 7:14 I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him with the rod of men, with floggings inflicted by men.
102Sm 7:15 But my love will never be taken away from him, as I took it away from Saul, whom I removed from before you.
102Sm 7:16 Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever.'"
102Sm 7:17 Nathan reported to David all the words of this entire revelation.
102Sm 7:18 Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he said£º "Who am I, O Sovereign LORD, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
102Sm 7:19 And as if this were not enough in your sight, O Sovereign LORD, you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant. Is this your usual way of dealing with man, O Sovereign LORD?
102Sm 7:20 "What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, O Sovereign LORD.
102Sm 7:21 For the sake of your word and according to your will, you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant.
102Sm 7:22 "How great you are, O Sovereign LORD! There is no one like you, and there is no God but you, as we have heard with our own ears.
102Sm 7:23 And who is like your people Israel--the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, and to make a name for himself, and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt?
102Sm 7:24 You have established your people Israel as your very own forever, and you, O LORD, have become their God.
102Sm 7:25 "And now, LORD God, keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house. Do as you promised,
102Sm 7:26 so that your name will be great forever. Then men will say, 'The LORD Almighty is God over Israel!' And the house of your servant David will be established before you.
102Sm 7:27 "O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, you have revealed this to your servant, saying, 'I will build a house for you.' So your servant has found courage to offer you this prayer.
102Sm 7:28 O Sovereign LORD, you are God! Your words are trustworthy, and you have promised these good things to your servant.
102Sm 7:29 Now be pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever in your sight; for you, O Sovereign LORD, have spoken, and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever."
102Sm 8:1 In the course of time, David defeated the Philistines and subdued them, and he took Metheg Ammah from the control of the Philistines.
102Sm 8:2 David also defeated the Moabites. He made them lie down on the ground and measured them off with a length of cord. Every two lengths of them were put to death, and the third length was allowed to live. So the Moabites became subject to David and brought tribute.
102Sm 8:3 Moreover, David fought Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when he went to restore his control along the Euphrates River.
102Sm 8:4 David captured a thousand of his chariots, seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
102Sm 8:5 When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck down twenty-two thousand of them.
102Sm 8:6 He put garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, and the Arameans became subject to him and brought tribute. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went.
102Sm 8:7 David took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
102Sm 8:8 From Tebah and Berothai, towns that belonged to Hadadezer, King David took a great quantity of bronze.
102Sm 8:9 When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer,
102Sm 8:10 he sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over Hadadezer, who had been at war with Tou. Joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze.
102Sm 8:11 King David dedicated these articles to the LORD, as he had done with the silver and gold from all the nations he had subdued£º
102Sm 8:12 Edom and Moab, the Ammonites and the Philistines, and Amalek. He also dedicated the plunder taken from Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
102Sm 8:13 And David became famous after he returned from striking down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
102Sm 8:14 He put garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites became subject to David. The LORD gave David victory wherever he went.
102Sm 8:15 David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all his people.
102Sm 8:16 Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
102Sm 8:17 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was secretary;
102Sm 8:18 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites; and David's sons were royal advisers.
102Sm 9:1 David asked, "Is there anyone still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
102Sm 9:2 Now there was a servant of Saul's household named Ziba. They called him to appear before David, and the king said to him, "Are you Ziba?" "Your servant," he replied.
102Sm 9:3 The king asked, "Is there no one still left of the house of Saul to whom I can show God's kindness?" Ziba answered the king, "There is still a son of Jonathan; he is crippled in both feet."
102Sm 9:4 "Where is he?" the king asked. Ziba answered, "He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar."
102Sm 9:5 So King David had him brought from Lo Debar, from the house of Makir son of Ammiel.
102Sm 9:6 When Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, he bowed down to pay him honor. David said, "Mephibosheth!" "Your servant," he replied.
102Sm 9:7 "Don't be afraid," David said to him, "for I will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table."
102Sm 9:8 Mephibosheth bowed down and said, "What is your servant, that you should notice a dead dog like me?"
102Sm 9:9 Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, "I have given your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family.
102Sm 9:10 You and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops, so that your master's grandson may be provided for. And Mephibosheth, grandson of your master, will always eat at my table." (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.)
102Sm 9:11 Then Ziba said to the king, "Your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do." So Mephibosheth ate at David's table like one of the king's sons.
102Sm 9:12 Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica, and all the members of Ziba's household were servants of Mephibosheth.
102Sm 9:13 And Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king's table, and he was crippled in both feet.
102Sm 10:1 In the course of time, the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun succeeded him as king.
102Sm 10:2 David thought, "I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me." So David sent a delegation to express his sympathy to Hanun concerning his father. When David's men came to the land of the Ammonites,
102Sm 10:3 the Ammonite nobles said to Hanun their lord, "Do you think David is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy? Hasn't David sent them to you to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it?"
102Sm 10:4 So Hanun seized David's men, shaved off half of each man's beard, cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks, and sent them away.
102Sm 10:5 When David was told about this, he sent messengers to meet the men, for they were greatly humiliated. The king said, "Stay at Jericho till your beards have grown, and then come back."
102Sm 10:6 When the Ammonites realized that they had become a stench in David's nostrils, they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah, as well as the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and also twelve thousand men from Tob.
102Sm 10:7 On hearing this, David sent Joab out with the entire army of fighting men.
102Sm 10:8 The Ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the open country.
102Sm 10:9 Joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him; so he selected some of the best troops in Israel and deployed them against the Arameans.
102Sm 10:10 He put the rest of the men under the command of Abishai his brother and deployed them against the Ammonites.
102Sm 10:11 Joab said, "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you are to come to my rescue; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to rescue you.
102Sm 10:12 Be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The LORD will do what is good in his sight."
102Sm 10:13 Then Joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the Arameans, and they fled before him.
102Sm 10:14 When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were fleeing, they fled before Abishai and went inside the city. So Joab returned from fighting the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
102Sm 10:15 After the Arameans saw that they had been routed by Israel, they regrouped.
102Sm 10:16 Hadadezer had Arameans brought from beyond the River; they went to Helam, with Shobach the commander of Hadadezer's army leading them.
102Sm 10:17 When David was told of this, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan and went to Helam. The Arameans formed their battle lines to meet David and fought against him.
102Sm 10:18 But they fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers. He also struck down Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there.
102Sm 10:19 When all the kings who were vassals of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with the Israelites and became subject to them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.
102Sm 11:1 In the spring, at the time when kings go off to war, David sent Joab out with the king's men and the whole Israelite army. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.
102Sm 11:2 One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing. The woman was very beautiful,
102Sm 11:3 and David sent someone to find out about her. The man said, "Isn't this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
102Sm 11:4 Then David sent messengers to get her. She came to him, and he slept with her. (She had purified herself from her uncleanness.) Then she went back home.
102Sm 11:5 The woman conceived and sent word to David, saying, "I am pregnant."
102Sm 11:6 So David sent this word to Joab£º "Send me Uriah the Hittite." And Joab sent him to David.
102Sm 11:7 When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were and how the war was going.
102Sm 11:8 Then David said to Uriah, "Go down to your house and wash your feet." So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king was sent after him.
102Sm 11:9 But Uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his master's servants and did not go down to his house.
102Sm 11:10 When David was told, "Uriah did not go home," he asked him, "Haven't you just come from a distance? Why didn't you go home?"
102Sm 11:11 Uriah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents, and my master Joab and my lord's men are camped in the open fields. How could I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? As surely as you live, I will not do such a thing!"
102Sm 11:12 Then David said to him, "Stay here one more day, and tomorrow I will send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.
102Sm 11:13 At David's invitation, he ate and drank with him, and David made him drunk. But in the evening Uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his master's servants; he did not go home.
102Sm 11:14 In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah.
102Sm 11:15 In it he wrote, "Put Uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die."
102Sm 11:16 So while Joab had the city under siege, he put Uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were.
102Sm 11:17 When the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, some of the men in David's army fell; moreover, Uriah the Hittite died.
102Sm 11:18 Joab sent David a full account of the battle.
102Sm 11:19 He instructed the messenger£º "When you have finished giving the king this account of the battle,
102Sm 11:20 the king's anger may flare up, and he may ask you, 'Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn't you know they would shoot arrows from the wall?
102Sm 11:21 Who killed Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth? Didn't a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died in Thebez? Why did you get so close to the wall?' If he asks you this, then say to him, 'Also, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead.'"
102Sm 11:22 The messenger set out, and when he arrived he told David everything Joab had sent him to say.
102Sm 11:23 The messenger said to David, "The men overpowered us and came out against us in the open, but we drove them back to the entrance to the city gate.
102Sm 11:24 Then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall, and some of the king's men died. Moreover, your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead."
102Sm 11:25 David told the messenger, "Say this to Joab£º 'Don't let this upset you; the sword devours one as well as another. Press the attack against the city and destroy it.' Say this to encourage Joab."
102Sm 11:26 When Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.
102Sm 11:27 After the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing David had done displeased the LORD.
102Sm 12:1 The LORD sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, "There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor.
102Sm 12:2 The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle,
102Sm 12:3 but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.
102Sm 12:4 "Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him."
102Sm 12:5 David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, "As surely as the LORD lives, the man who did this deserves to die!
102Sm 12:6 He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity."
102Sm 12:7 Then Nathan said to David, "You are the man! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º 'I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
102Sm 12:8 I gave your master's house to you, and your master's wives into your arms. I gave you the house of Israel and Judah. And if all this had been too little, I would have given you even more.
102Sm 12:9 Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
102Sm 12:10 Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'
102Sm 12:11 "This is what the LORD says£º 'Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity upon you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight.
102Sm 12:12 You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.'"
102Sm 12:13 Then David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan replied, "The LORD has taken away your sin. You are not going to die.
102Sm 12:14 But because by doing this you have made the enemies of the LORD show utter contempt, the son born to you will die."
102Sm 12:15 After Nathan had gone home, the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David, and he became ill.
102Sm 12:16 David pleaded with God for the child. He fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground.
102Sm 12:17 The elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he refused, and he would not eat any food with them.
102Sm 12:18 On the seventh day the child died. David's servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they thought, "While the child was still living, we spoke to David but he would not listen to us. How can we tell him the child is dead? He may do something desperate."
102Sm 12:19 David noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead. "Is the child dead?" he asked. "Yes," they replied, "he is dead."
102Sm 12:20 Then David got up from the ground. After he had washed, put on lotions and changed his clothes, he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and at his request they served him food, and he ate.
102Sm 12:21 His servants asked him, "Why are you acting this way? While the child was alive, you fasted and wept, but now that the child is dead, you get up and eat!"
102Sm 12:22 He answered, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept. I thought, 'Who knows? The LORD may be gracious to me and let the child live.'
102Sm 12:23 But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him, but he will not return to me."
102Sm 12:24 Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and he went to her and lay with her. She gave birth to a son, and they named him Solomon. The LORD loved him;
102Sm 12:25 and because the LORD loved him, he sent word through Nathan the prophet to name him Jedidiah.
102Sm 12:26 Meanwhile Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal citadel.
102Sm 12:27 Joab then sent messengers to David, saying, "I have fought against Rabbah and taken its water supply.
102Sm 12:28 Now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it. Otherwise I will take the city, and it will be named after me."
102Sm 12:29 So David mustered the entire army and went to Rabbah, and attacked and captured it.
102Sm 12:30 He took the crown from the head of their king--its weight was a talent of gold, and it was set with precious stones--and it was placed on David's head. He took a great quantity of plunder from the city
102Sm 12:31 and brought out the people who were there, consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes, and he made them work at brickmaking. He did this to all the Ammonite towns. Then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 13:1 In the course of time, Amnon son of David fell in love with Tamar, the beautiful sister of Absalom son of David.
102Sm 13:2 Amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her.
102Sm 13:3 Now Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother. Jonadab was a very shrewd man.
102Sm 13:4 He asked Amnon, "Why do you, the king's son, look so haggard morning after morning? Won't you tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I'm in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
102Sm 13:5 "Go to bed and pretend to be ill," Jonadab said. "When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'I would like my sister Tamar to come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare the food in my sight so I may watch her and then eat it from her hand.'"
102Sm 13:6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, "I would like my sister Tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight, so I may eat from her hand."
102Sm 13:7 David sent word to Tamar at the palace£º "Go to the house of your brother Amnon and prepare some food for him."
102Sm 13:8 So Tamar went to the house of her brother Amnon, who was lying down. She took some dough, kneaded it, made the bread in his sight and baked it.
102Sm 13:9 Then she took the pan and served him the bread, but he refused to eat. "Send everyone out of here," Amnon said. So everyone left him.
102Sm 13:10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food here into my bedroom so I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother Amnon in his bedroom.
102Sm 13:11 But when she took it to him to eat, he grabbed her and said, "Come to bed with me, my sister."
102Sm 13:12 "Don't, my brother!" she said to him. "Don't force me. Such a thing should not be done in Israel! Don't do this wicked thing.
102Sm 13:13 What about me? Where could I get rid of my disgrace? And what about you? You would be like one of the wicked fools in Israel. Please speak to the king; he will not keep me from being married to you."
102Sm 13:14 But he refused to listen to her, and since he was stronger than she, he raped her.
102Sm 13:15 Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her. Amnon said to her, "Get up and get out!"
102Sm 13:16 "No!" she said to him. "Sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me." But he refused to listen to her.
102Sm 13:17 He called his personal servant and said, "Get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her."
102Sm 13:18 So his servant put her out and bolted the door after her. She was wearing a richly ornamented robe, for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore.
102Sm 13:19 Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented robe she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and went away, weeping aloud as she went.
102Sm 13:20 Her brother Absalom said to her, "Has that Amnon, your brother, been with you? Be quiet now, my sister; he is your brother. Don't take this thing to heart." And Tamar lived in her brother Absalom's house, a desolate woman.
102Sm 13:21 When King David heard all this, he was furious.
102Sm 13:22 Absalom never said a word to Amnon, either good or bad; he hated Amnon because he had disgraced his sister Tamar.
102Sm 13:23 Two years later, when Absalom's sheepshearers were at Baal Hazor near the border of Ephraim, he invited all the king's sons to come there.
102Sm 13:24 Absalom went to the king and said, "Your servant has had shearers come. Will the king and his officials please join me?"
102Sm 13:25 "No, my son," the king replied. "All of us should not go; we would only be a burden to you." Although Absalom urged him, he still refused to go, but gave him his blessing.
102Sm 13:26 Then Absalom said, "If not, please let my brother Amnon come with us." The king asked him, "Why should he go with you?"
102Sm 13:27 But Absalom urged him, so he sent with him Amnon and the rest of the king's sons.
102Sm 13:28 Absalom ordered his men, "Listen! When Amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and I say to you, 'Strike Amnon down,' then kill him. Don't be afraid. Have not I given you this order? Be strong and brave."
102Sm 13:29 So Absalom's men did to Amnon what Absalom had ordered. Then all the king's sons got up, mounted their mules and fled.
102Sm 13:30 While they were on their way, the report came to David£º "Absalom has struck down all the king's sons; not one of them is left."
102Sm 13:31 The king stood up, tore his clothes and lay down on the ground; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
102Sm 13:32 But Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, said, "My lord should not think that they killed all the princes; only Amnon is dead. This has been Absalom's expressed intention ever since the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar.
102Sm 13:33 My lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the king's sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead."
102Sm 13:34 Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. Now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him, coming down the side of the hill. The watchman went and told the king, "I see men in the direction of Horonaim, on the side of the hill."
102Sm 13:35 Jonadab said to the king, "See, the king's sons are here; it has happened just as your servant said."
102Sm 13:36 As he finished speaking, the king's sons came in, wailing loudly. The king, too, and all his servants wept very bitterly.
102Sm 13:37 Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. But King David mourned for his son every day.
102Sm 13:38 After Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he stayed there three years.
102Sm 13:39 And the spirit of the king longed to go to Absalom, for he was consoled concerning Amnon's death.
102Sm 14:1 Joab son of Zeruiah knew that the king's heart longed for Absalom.
102Sm 14:2 So Joab sent someone to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there. He said to her, "Pretend you are in mourning. Dress in mourning clothes, and don't use any cosmetic lotions. Act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead.
102Sm 14:3 Then go to the king and speak these words to him." And Joab put the words in her mouth.
102Sm 14:4 When the woman from Tekoa went to the king, she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor, and she said, "Help me, O king!"
102Sm 14:5 The king asked her, "What is troubling you?" She said, "I am indeed a widow; my husband is dead.
102Sm 14:6 I your servant had two sons. They got into a fight with each other in the field, and no one was there to separate them. One struck the other and killed him.
102Sm 14:7 Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant; they say, 'Hand over the one who struck his brother down, so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed; then we will get rid of the heir as well.' They would put out the only burning coal I have left, leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth."
102Sm 14:8 The king said to the woman, "Go home, and I will issue an order in your behalf."
102Sm 14:9 But the woman from Tekoa said to him, "My lord the king, let the blame rest on me and on my father's family, and let the king and his throne be without guilt."
102Sm 14:10 The king replied, "If anyone says anything to you, bring him to me, and he will not bother you again."
102Sm 14:11 She said, "Then let the king invoke the LORD his God to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction, so that my son will not be destroyed." "As surely as the LORD lives," he said, "not one hair of your son's head will fall to the ground."
102Sm 14:12 Then the woman said, "Let your servant speak a word to my lord the king." "Speak," he replied.
102Sm 14:13 The woman said, "Why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of God? When the king says this, does he not convict himself, for the king has not brought back his banished son?
102Sm 14:14 Like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be recovered, so we must die. But God does not take away life; instead, he devises ways so that a banished person may not remain estranged from him.
102Sm 14:15 "And now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king; perhaps he will do what his servant asks.
102Sm 14:16 Perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from the inheritance God gave us.'
102Sm 14:17 "And now your servant says, 'May the word of my lord the king bring me rest, for my lord the king is like an angel of God in discerning good and evil. May the LORD your God be with you.'"
102Sm 14:18 Then the king said to the woman, "Do not keep from me the answer to what I am going to ask you." "Let my lord the king speak," the woman said.
102Sm 14:19 The king asked, "Isn't the hand of Joab with you in all this?" The woman answered, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says. Yes, it was your servant Joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant.
102Sm 14:20 Your servant Joab did this to change the present situation. My lord has wisdom like that of an angel of God--he knows everything that happens in the land."
102Sm 14:21 The king said to Joab, "Very well, I will do it. Go, bring back the young man Absalom."
102Sm 14:22 Joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor, and he blessed the king. Joab said, "Today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, because the king has granted his servant's request."
102Sm 14:23 Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
102Sm 14:24 But the king said, "He must go to his own house; he must not see my face." So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king.
102Sm 14:25 In all Israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as Absalom. From the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him.
102Sm 14:26 Whenever he cut the hair of his head--he used to cut his hair from time to time when it became too heavy for him--he would weigh it, and its weight was two hundred shekels by the royal standard.
102Sm 14:27 Three sons and a daughter were born to Absalom. The daughter's name was Tamar, and she became a beautiful woman.
102Sm 14:28 Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king's face.
102Sm 14:29 Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab refused to come to him. So he sent a second time, but he refused to come.
102Sm 14:30 Then he said to his servants, "Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.
102Sm 14:31 Then Joab did go to Absalom's house and he said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
102Sm 14:32 Absalom said to Joab, "Look, I sent word to you and said, 'Come here so I can send you to the king to ask, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me if I were still there!" 'Now then, I want to see the king's face, and if I am guilty of anything, let him put me to death."
102Sm 14:33 So Joab went to the king and told him this. Then the king summoned Absalom, and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king. And the king kissed Absalom.
102Sm 15:1 In the course of time, Absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him.
102Sm 15:2 He would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate. Whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision, Absalom would call out to him, "What town are you from?" He would answer, "Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel."
102Sm 15:3 Then Absalom would say to him, "Look, your claims are valid and proper, but there is no representative of the king to hear you."
102Sm 15:4 And Absalom would add, "If only I were appointed judge in the land! Then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and I would see that he gets justice."
102Sm 15:5 Also, whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out his hand, take hold of him and kiss him.
102Sm 15:6 Absalom behaved in this way toward all the Israelites who came to the king asking for justice, and so he stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
102Sm 15:7 At the end of four years, Absalom said to the king, "Let me go to Hebron and fulfill a vow I made to the LORD.
102Sm 15:8 While your servant was living at Geshur in Aram, I made this vow£º 'If the LORD takes me back to Jerusalem, I will worship the LORD in Hebron.'"
102Sm 15:9 The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he went to Hebron.
102Sm 15:10 Then Absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of Israel to say, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, then say, 'Absalom is king in Hebron.'"
102Sm 15:11 Two hundred men from Jerusalem had accompanied Absalom. They had been invited as guests and went quite innocently, knowing nothing about the matter.
102Sm 15:12 While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, to come from Giloh, his hometown. And so the conspiracy gained strength, and Absalom's following kept on increasing.
102Sm 15:13 A messenger came and told David, "The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom."
102Sm 15:14 Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, "Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin upon us and put the city to the sword."
102Sm 15:15 The king's officials answered him, "Your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses."
102Sm 15:16 The king set out, with his entire household following him; but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace.
102Sm 15:17 So the king set out, with all the people following him, and they halted at a place some distance away.
102Sm 15:18 All his men marched past him, along with all the Kerethites and Pelethites; and all the six hundred Gittites who had accompanied him from Gath marched before the king.
102Sm 15:19 The king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why should you come along with us? Go back and stay with King Absalom. You are a foreigner, an exile from your homeland.
102Sm 15:20 You came only yesterday. And today shall I make you wander about with us, when I do not know where I am going? Go back, and take your countrymen. May kindness and faithfulness be with you."
102Sm 15:21 But Ittai replied to the king, "As surely as the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether it means life or death, there will your servant be."
102Sm 15:22 David said to Ittai, "Go ahead, march on." So Ittai the Gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him.
102Sm 15:23 The whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by. The king also crossed the Kidron Valley, and all the people moved on toward the desert.
102Sm 15:24 Zadok was there, too, and all the Levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city.
102Sm 15:25 Then the king said to Zadok, "Take the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the LORD'S eyes, he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again.
102Sm 15:26 But if he says, 'I am not pleased with you,' then I am ready; let him do to me whatever seems good to him."
102Sm 15:27 The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer? Go back to the city in peace, with your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan son of Abiathar. You and Abiathar take your two sons with you.
102Sm 15:28 I will wait at the fords in the desert until word comes from you to inform me."
102Sm 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar took the ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.
102Sm 15:30 But David continued up the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went; his head was covered and he was barefoot. All the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up.
102Sm 15:31 Now David had been told, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom." So David prayed, "O LORD, turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness."
102Sm 15:32 When David arrived at the summit, where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite was there to meet him, his robe torn and dust on his head.
102Sm 15:33 David said to him, "If you go with me, you will be a burden to me.
102Sm 15:34 But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, 'I will be your servant, O king; I was your father's servant in the past, but now I will be your servant,' then you can help me by frustrating Ahithophel's advice.
102Sm 15:35 Won't the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Tell them anything you hear in the king's palace.
102Sm 15:36 Their two sons, Ahimaaz son of Zadok and Jonathan son of Abiathar, are there with them. Send them to me with anything you hear."
102Sm 15:37 So David's friend Hushai arrived at Jerusalem as Absalom was entering the city.
102Sm 16:1 When David had gone a short distance beyond the summit, there was Ziba, the steward of Mephibosheth, waiting to meet him. He had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine.
102Sm 16:2 The king asked Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the desert."
102Sm 16:3 The king then asked, "Where is your master's grandson?" Ziba said to him, "He is staying in Jerusalem, because he thinks, 'Today the house of Israel will give me back my grandfather's kingdom.'"
102Sm 16:4 Then the king said to Ziba, "All that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours." "I humbly bow," Ziba said. "May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king."
102Sm 16:5 As King David approached Bahurim, a man from the same clan as Saul's family came out from there. His name was Shimei son of Gera, and he cursed as he came out.
102Sm 16:6 He pelted David and all the king's officials with stones, though all the troops and the special guard were on David's right and left.
102Sm 16:7 As he cursed, Shimei said, "Get out, get out, you man of blood, you scoundrel!
102Sm 16:8 The LORD has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of Saul, in whose place you have reigned. The LORD has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. You have come to ruin because you are a man of blood!"
102Sm 16:9 Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and cut off his head."
102Sm 16:10 But the king said, "What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? If he is cursing because the LORD said to him, 'Curse David,' who can ask, 'Why do you do this?'"
102Sm 16:11 David then said to Abishai and all his officials, "My son, who is of my own flesh, is trying to take my life. How much more, then, this Benjamite! Leave him alone; let him curse, for the LORD has told him to.
102Sm 16:12 It may be that the LORD will see my distress and repay me with good for the cursing I am receiving today."
102Sm 16:13 So David and his men continued along the road while Shimei was going along the hillside opposite him, cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt.
102Sm 16:14 The king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted. And there he refreshed himself.
102Sm 16:15 Meanwhile, Absalom and all the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with him.
102Sm 16:16 Then Hushai the Arkite, David's friend, went to Absalom and said to him, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
102Sm 16:17 Absalom asked Hushai, "Is this the love you show your friend? Why didn't you go with your friend?"
102Sm 16:18 Hushai said to Absalom, "No, the one chosen by the LORD, by these people, and by all the men of Israel--his I will be, and I will remain with him.
102Sm 16:19 Furthermore, whom should I serve? Should I not serve the son? Just as I served your father, so I will serve you."
102Sm 16:20 Absalom said to Ahithophel, "Give us your advice. What should we do?"
102Sm 16:21 Ahithophel answered, "Lie with your father's concubines whom he left to take care of the palace. Then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench in your father's nostrils, and the hands of everyone with you will be strengthened."
102Sm 16:22 So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he lay with his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
102Sm 16:23 Now in those days the advice Ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of God. That was how both David and Absalom regarded all of Ahithophel's advice.
102Sm 17:1 Ahithophel said to Absalom, "I would choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of David.
102Sm 17:2 I would attack him while he is weary and weak. I would strike him with terror, and then all the people with him will flee. I would strike down only the king
102Sm 17:3 and bring all the people back to you. The death of the man you seek will mean the return of all; all the people will be unharmed."
102Sm 17:4 This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.
102Sm 17:5 But Absalom said, "Summon also Hushai the Arkite, so we can hear what he has to say."
102Sm 17:6 When Hushai came to him, Absalom said, "Ahithophel has given this advice. Should we do what he says? If not, give us your opinion."
102Sm 17:7 Hushai replied to Absalom, "The advice Ahithophel has given is not good this time.
102Sm 17:8 You know your father and his men; they are fighters, and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs. Besides, your father is an experienced fighter; he will not spend the night with the troops.
102Sm 17:9 Even now, he is hidden in a cave or some other place. If he should attack your troops first, whoever hears about it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the troops who follow Absalom.'
102Sm 17:10 Then even the bravest soldier, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will melt with fear, for all Israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave.
102Sm 17:11 "So I advise you£º Let all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba--as numerous as the sand on the seashore--be gathered to you, with you yourself leading them into battle.
102Sm 17:12 Then we will attack him wherever he may be found, and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground. Neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.
102Sm 17:13 If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a piece of it can be found."
102Sm 17:14 Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel." For the LORD had determined to frustrate the good advice of Ahithophel in order to bring disaster on Absalom.
102Sm 17:15 Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, "Ahithophel has advised Absalom and the elders of Israel to do such and such, but I have advised them to do so and so.
102Sm 17:16 Now send a message immediately and tell David, 'Do not spend the night at the fords in the desert; cross over without fail, or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up.'"
102Sm 17:17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel. A servant girl was to go and inform them, and they were to go and tell King David, for they could not risk being seen entering the city.
102Sm 17:18 But a young man saw them and told Absalom. So the two of them left quickly and went to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.
102Sm 17:19 His wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it. No one knew anything about it.
102Sm 17:20 When Absalom's men came to the woman at the house, they asked, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman answered them, "They crossed over the brook." The men searched but found no one, so they returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 17:21 After the men had gone, the two climbed out of the well and went to inform King David. They said to him, "Set out and cross the river at once; Ahithophel has advised such and such against you."
102Sm 17:22 So David and all the people with him set out and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, no one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.
102Sm 17:23 When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He put his house in order and then hanged himself. So he died and was buried in his father's tomb.
102Sm 17:24 David went to Mahanaim, and Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
102Sm 17:25 Absalom had appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Jether, an Israelite who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.
102Sm 17:26 The Israelites and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.
102Sm 17:27 When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Makir son of Ammiel from Lo Debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
102Sm 17:28 brought bedding and bowls and articles of pottery. They also brought wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans and lentils,
102Sm 17:29 honey and curds, sheep, and cheese from cows' milk for David and his people to eat. For they said, "The people have become hungry and tired and thirsty in the desert."
102Sm 18:1 David mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
102Sm 18:2 David sent the troops out--a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, "I myself will surely march out with you."
102Sm 18:3 But the men said, "You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care; but you are worth ten thousand of us. It would be better now for you to give us support from the city."
102Sm 18:4 The king answered, "I will do whatever seems best to you." So the king stood beside the gate while all the men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands.
102Sm 18:5 The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, "Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake." And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders.
102Sm 18:6 The army marched into the field to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim.
102Sm 18:7 There the army of Israel was defeated by David's men, and the casualties that day were great--twenty thousand men.
102Sm 18:8 The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword.
102Sm 18:9 Now Absalom happened to meet David's men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom's head got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going.
102Sm 18:10 When one of the men saw this, he told Joab, "I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree."
102Sm 18:11 Joab said to the man who had told him this, "What! You saw him? Why didn't you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels of silver and a warrior's belt."
102Sm 18:12 But the man replied, "Even if a thousand shekels were weighed out into my hands, I would not lift my hand against the king's son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, 'Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.'
102Sm 18:13 And if I had put my life in jeopardy--and nothing is hidden from the king--you would have kept your distance from me."
102Sm 18:14 Joab said, "I'm not going to wait like this for you." So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom's heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree.
102Sm 18:15 And ten of Joab's armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him.
102Sm 18:16 Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them.
102Sm 18:17 They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes.
102Sm 18:18 During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King's Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, "I have no son to carry on the memory of my name." He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom's Monument to this day.
102Sm 18:19 Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, "Let me run and take the news to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the hand of his enemies."
102Sm 18:20 "You are not the one to take the news today," Joab told him. "You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king's son is dead."
102Sm 18:21 Then Joab said to a Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off.
102Sm 18:22 Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, "Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite." But Joab replied, "My son, why do you want to go? You don't have any news that will bring you a reward."
102Sm 18:23 He said, "Come what may, I want to run." So Joab said, "Run!" Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.
102Sm 18:24 While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone.
102Sm 18:25 The watchman called out to the king and reported it. The king said, "If he is alone, he must have good news." And the man came closer and closer.
102Sm 18:26 Then the watchman saw another man running, and he called down to the gatekeeper, "Look, another man running alone!" The king said, "He must be bringing good news, too."
102Sm 18:27 The watchman said, "It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok." "He's a good man," the king said. "He comes with good news."
102Sm 18:28 Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, "All is well!" He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Praise be to the LORD your God! He has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king."
102Sm 18:29 The king asked, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" Ahimaaz answered, "I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king's servant and me, your servant, but I don't know what it was."
102Sm 18:30 The king said, "Stand aside and wait here." So he stepped aside and stood there.
102Sm 18:31 Then the Cushite arrived and said, "My lord the king, hear the good news! The LORD has delivered you today from all who rose up against you."
102Sm 18:32 The king asked the Cushite, "Is the young man Absalom safe?" The Cushite replied, "May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man."
102Sm 18:33 The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said£º "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you--O Absalom, my son, my son!"
102Sm 19:1 Joab was told, "The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom."
102Sm 19:2 And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, "The king is grieving for his son."
102Sm 19:3 The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle.
102Sm 19:4 The king covered his face and cried aloud, "O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!"
102Sm 19:5 Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, "Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines.
102Sm 19:6 You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead.
102Sm 19:7 Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the LORD that if you don't go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come upon you from your youth till now."
102Sm 19:8 So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, "The king is sitting in the gateway," they all came before him. Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes.
102Sm 19:9 Throughout the tribes of Israel, the people were all arguing with each other, saying, "The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country because of Absalom;
102Sm 19:10 and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?"
102Sm 19:11 King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests£º "Ask the elders of Judah, 'Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters?
102Sm 19:12 You are my brothers, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?'
102Sm 19:13 And say to Amasa, 'Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if from now on you are not the commander of my army in place of Joab.'"
102Sm 19:14 He won over the hearts of all the men of Judah as though they were one man. They sent word to the king, "Return, you and all your men."
102Sm 19:15 Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan.
102Sm 19:16 Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
102Sm 19:17 With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul's household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was.
102Sm 19:18 They crossed at the ford to take the king's household over and to do whatever he wished. When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king
102Sm 19:19 and said to him, "May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind.
102Sm 19:20 For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first of the whole house of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king."
102Sm 19:21 Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, "Shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the LORD'S anointed."
102Sm 19:22 David replied, "What do you and I have in common, you sons of Zeruiah? This day you have become my adversaries! Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Do I not know that today I am king over Israel?"
102Sm 19:23 So the king said to Shimei, "You shall not die." And the king promised him on oath.
102Sm 19:24 Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely.
102Sm 19:25 When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, "Why didn't you go with me, Mephibosheth?"
102Sm 19:26 He said, "My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, 'I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.' But Ziba my servant betrayed me.
102Sm 19:27 And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever pleases you.
102Sm 19:28 All my grandfather's descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who sat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?"
102Sm 19:29 The king said to him, "Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the fields."
102Sm 19:30 Mephibosheth said to the king, "Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has arrived home safely."
102Sm 19:31 Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there.
102Sm 19:32 Now Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man.
102Sm 19:33 The king said to Barzillai, "Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you."
102Sm 19:34 But Barzillai answered the king, "How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king?
102Sm 19:35 I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is good and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of men and women singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?
102Sm 19:36 Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way?
102Sm 19:37 Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever pleases you."
102Sm 19:38 The king said, "Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever pleases you. And anything you desire from me I will do for you."
102Sm 19:39 So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and gave him his blessing, and Barzillai returned to his home.
102Sm 19:40 When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over.
102Sm 19:41 Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, "Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?"
102Sm 19:42 All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, "We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king's provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?"
102Sm 19:43 Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, "We have ten shares in the king; and besides, we have a greater claim on David than you have. So why do you treat us with contempt? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?" But the men of Judah responded even more harshly than the men of Israel.
102Sm 20:1 Now a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bicri, a Benjamite, happened to be there. He sounded the trumpet and shouted, "We have no share in David, no part in Jesse's son! Every man to his tent, O Israel!"
102Sm 20:2 So all the men of Israel deserted David to follow Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.
102Sm 20:3 When David returned to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard. He provided for them, but did not lie with them. They were kept in confinement till the day of their death, living as widows.
102Sm 20:4 Then the king said to Amasa, "Summon the men of Judah to come to me within three days, and be here yourself."
102Sm 20:5 But when Amasa went to summon Judah, he took longer than the time the king had set for him.
102Sm 20:6 David said to Abishai, "Now Sheba son of Bicri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your master's men and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and escape from us."
102Sm 20:7 So Joab's men and the Kerethites and Pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of Abishai. They marched out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.
102Sm 20:8 While they were at the great rock in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was wearing his military tunic, and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath. As he stepped forward, it dropped out of its sheath.
102Sm 20:9 Joab said to Amasa, "How are you, my brother?" Then Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.
102Sm 20:10 Amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in Joab's hand, and Joab plunged it into his belly, and his intestines spilled out on the ground. Without being stabbed again, Amasa died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bicri.
102Sm 20:11 One of Joab's men stood beside Amasa and said, "Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab!"
102Sm 20:12 Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road, and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt there. When he realized that everyone who came up to Amasa stopped, he dragged him from the road into a field and threw a garment over him.
102Sm 20:13 After Amasa had been removed from the road, all the men went on with Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bicri.
102Sm 20:14 Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maacah and through the entire region of the Berites, who gathered together and followed him.
102Sm 20:15 All the troops with Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth Maacah. They built a siege ramp up to the city, and it stood against the outer fortifications. While they were battering the wall to bring it down,
102Sm 20:16 a wise woman called from the city, "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here so I can speak to him."
102Sm 20:17 He went toward her, and she asked, "Are you Joab?" "I am," he answered. She said, "Listen to what your servant has to say." "I'm listening," he said.
102Sm 20:18 She continued, "Long ago they used to say, 'Get your answer at Abel,' and that settled it.
102Sm 20:19 We are the peaceful and faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel. Why do you want to swallow up the LORD'S inheritance?"
102Sm 20:20 "Far be it from me!" Joab replied, "Far be it from me to swallow up or destroy!
102Sm 20:21 That is not the case. A man named Sheba son of Bicri, from the hill country of Ephraim, has lifted up his hand against the king, against David. Hand over this one man, and I'll withdraw from the city." The woman said to Joab, "His head will be thrown to you from the wall."
102Sm 20:22 Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bicri and threw it to Joab. So he sounded the trumpet, and his men dispersed from the city, each returning to his home. And Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem.
102Sm 20:23 Joab was over Israel's entire army; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites;
102Sm 20:24 Adoniram was in charge of forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was recorder;
102Sm 20:25 Sheva was secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
102Sm 20:26 and Ira the Jairite was David's priest.
102Sm 21:1 During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the LORD. The LORD said, "It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death."
102Sm 21:2 The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.)
102Sm 21:3 David asked the Gibeonites, "What shall I do for you? How shall I make amends so that you will bless the LORD'S inheritance?"
102Sm 21:4 The Gibeonites answered him, "We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death." "What do you want me to do for you?" David asked.
102Sm 21:5 They answered the king, "As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel,
102Sm 21:6 let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and exposed before the LORD at Gibeah of Saul--the Lord's chosen one." So the king said, "I will give them to you."
102Sm 21:7 The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the LORD between David and Jonathan son of Saul.
102Sm 21:8 But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah's daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
102Sm 21:9 He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed and exposed them on a hill before the LORD. All seven of them fell together; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest, just as the barley harvest was beginning.
102Sm 21:10 Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds of the air touch them by day or the wild animals by night.
102Sm 21:11 When David was told what Aiah's daughter Rizpah, Saul's concubine, had done,
102Sm 21:12 he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. (They had taken them secretly from the public square at Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they struck Saul down on Gilboa.)
102Sm 21:13 David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up.
102Sm 21:14 They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul's father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land.
102Sm 21:15 Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted.
102Sm 21:16 And Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels and who was armed with a new sword, said he would kill David.
102Sm 21:17 But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David's rescue; he struck the Philistine down and killed him. Then David's men swore to him, saying, "Never again will you go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel will not be extinguished."
102Sm 21:18 In the course of time, there was another battle with the Philistines, at Gob. At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha.
102Sm 21:19 In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver's rod.
102Sm 21:20 In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot--twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha.
102Sm 21:21 When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David's brother, killed him.
102Sm 21:22 These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men.
102Sm 22:1 David sang to the LORD the words of this song when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.
102Sm 22:2 He said£º "The LORD is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;
102Sm 22:3 my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation. He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior--from violent men you save me.
102Sm 22:4 I call to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I am saved from my enemies.
102Sm 22:5 "The waves of death swirled about me; the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.
102Sm 22:6 The cords of the grave coiled around me; the snares of death confronted me.
102Sm 22:7 In my distress I called to the LORD; I called out to my God. From his temple he heard my voice; my cry came to his ears.
102Sm 22:8 "The earth trembled and quaked, the foundations of the heavens shook; they trembled because he was angry.
102Sm 22:9 Smoke rose from his nostrils; consuming fire came from his mouth, burning coals blazed out of it.
102Sm 22:10 He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under his feet.
102Sm 22:11 He mounted the cherubim and flew; he soared on the wings of the wind.
102Sm 22:12 He made darkness his canopy around him--the dark rain clouds of the sky.
102Sm 22:13 Out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth.
102Sm 22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.
102Sm 22:15 He shot arrows and scattered the enemies, bolts of lightning and routed them.
102Sm 22:16 The valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the LORD, at the blast of breath from his nostrils.
102Sm 22:17 "He reached down from on high and took hold of me; he drew me out of deep waters.
102Sm 22:18 He rescued me from my powerful enemy, from my foes, who were too strong for me.
102Sm 22:19 They confronted me in the day of my disaster, but the LORD was my support.
102Sm 22:20 He brought me out into a spacious place; he rescued me because he delighted in me.
102Sm 22:21 "The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.
102Sm 22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not done evil by turning from my God.
102Sm 22:23 All his laws are before me; I have not turned away from his decrees.
102Sm 22:24 I have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin.
102Sm 22:25 The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness in his sight.
102Sm 22:26 "To the faithful you show yourself faithful, to the blameless you show yourself blameless,
102Sm 22:27 to the pure you show yourself pure, but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd.
102Sm 22:28 You save the humble, but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low.
102Sm 22:29 You are my lamp, O LORD; the LORD turns my darkness into light.
102Sm 22:30 With your help I can advance against a troop; with my God I can scale a wall.
102Sm 22:31 "As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is flawless. He is a shield for all who take refuge in him.
102Sm 22:32 For who is God besides the LORD? And who is the Rock except our God?
102Sm 22:33 It is God who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect.
102Sm 22:34 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer; he enables me to stand on the heights.
102Sm 22:35 He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
102Sm 22:36 You give me your shield of victory; you stoop down to make me great.
102Sm 22:37 You broaden the path beneath me, so that my ankles do not turn.
102Sm 22:38 "I pursued my enemies and crushed them; I did not turn back till they were destroyed.
102Sm 22:39 I crushed them completely, and they could not rise; they fell beneath my feet.
102Sm 22:40 You armed me with strength for battle; you made my adversaries bow at my feet.
102Sm 22:41 You made my enemies turn their backs in flight, and I destroyed my foes.
102Sm 22:42 They cried for help, but there was no one to save them--to the LORD, but he did not answer.
102Sm 22:43 I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth; I pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets.
102Sm 22:44 "You have delivered me from the attacks of my people; you have preserved me as the head of nations. People I did not know are subject to me,
102Sm 22:45 and foreigners come cringing to me; as soon as they hear me, they obey me.
102Sm 22:46 They all lose heart; they come trembling from their strongholds.
102Sm 22:47 "The LORD lives! Praise be to my Rock! Exalted be God, the Rock, my Savior!
102Sm 22:48 He is the God who avenges me, who puts the nations under me,
102Sm 22:49 who sets me free from my enemies. You exalted me above my foes; from violent men you rescued me.
102Sm 22:50 Therefore I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations; I will sing praises to your name.
102Sm 22:51 He gives his king great victories; he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed, to David and his descendants forever."
102Sm 23:1 These are the last words of David£º "The oracle of David son of Jesse, the oracle of the man exalted by the Most High, the man anointed by the God of Jacob, Israel's singer of songs£º
102Sm 23:2 "The Spirit of the LORD spoke through me; his word was on my tongue.
102Sm 23:3 The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of Israel said to me£º 'When one rules over men in righteousness, when he rules in the fear of God,
102Sm 23:4 he is like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning, like the brightness after rain that brings the grass from the earth.'
102Sm 23:5 "Is not my house right with God? Has he not made with me an everlasting covenant, arranged and secured in every part? Will he not bring to fruition my salvation and grant me my every desire?
102Sm 23:6 But evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns, which are not gathered with the hand.
102Sm 23:7 Whoever touches thorns uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear; they are burned up where they lie."
102Sm 23:8 These are the names of David's mighty men£º Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.
102Sm 23:9 Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty men, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim for battle. Then the men of Israel retreated,
102Sm 23:10 but he stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead.
102Sm 23:11 Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel's troops fled from them.
102Sm 23:12 But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the LORD brought about a great victory.
102Sm 23:13 During harvest time, three of the thirty chief men came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.
102Sm 23:14 At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem.
102Sm 23:15 David longed for water and said, "Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!"
102Sm 23:16 So the three mighty men broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out before the LORD.
102Sm 23:17 "Far be it from me, O LORD, to do this!" he said. "Is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives?" And David would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.
102Sm 23:18 Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three.
102Sm 23:19 Was he not held in greater honor than the Three? He became their commander, even though he was not included among them.
102Sm 23:20 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, who performed great exploits. He struck down two of Moab's best men. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion.
102Sm 23:21 And he struck down a huge Egyptian. Although the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear.
102Sm 23:22 Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty men.
102Sm 23:23 He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
102Sm 23:24 Among the Thirty were£º Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
102Sm 23:25 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,
102Sm 23:26 Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,
102Sm 23:27 Abiezer from Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite,
102Sm 23:28 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,
102Sm 23:29 Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite, Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin,
102Sm 23:30 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai from the ravines of Gaash,
102Sm 23:31 Abi-Albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,
102Sm 23:32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan
102Sm 23:33 son of Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
102Sm 23:34 Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maacathite, Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
102Sm 23:35 Hezro the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,
102Sm 23:36 Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, the son of Hagri,
102Sm 23:37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,
102Sm 23:38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite
102Sm 23:39 and Uriah the Hittite. There were thirty-seven in all.
102Sm 24:1 Again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go and take a census of Israel and Judah."
102Sm 24:2 So the king said to Joab and the army commanders with him, "Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are."
102Sm 24:3 But Joab replied to the king, "May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?"
102Sm 24:4 The king's word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel.
102Sm 24:5 After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer.
102Sm 24:6 They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon.
102Sm 24:7 Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah.
102Sm 24:8 After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
102Sm 24:9 Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king£º In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand.
102Sm 24:10 David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, O LORD, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing."
102Sm 24:11 Before David got up the next morning, the word of the LORD had come to Gad the prophet, David's seer£º
102Sm 24:12 "Go and tell David, 'This is what the LORD says£º I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.'"
102Sm 24:13 So Gad went to David and said to him, "Shall there come upon you three years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me."
102Sm 24:14 David said to Gad, "I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into the hands of men."
102Sm 24:15 So the LORD sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died.
102Sm 24:16 When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, "Enough! Withdraw your hand." The angel of the LORD was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
102Sm 24:17 When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the LORD, "I am the one who has sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall upon me and my family."
102Sm 24:18 On that day Gad went to David and said to him, "Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
102Sm 24:19 So David went up, as the LORD had commanded through Gad.
102Sm 24:20 When Araunah looked and saw the king and his men coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground.
102Sm 24:21 Araunah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" "To buy your threshing floor," David answered, "so I can build an altar to the LORD, that the plague on the people may be stopped."
102Sm 24:22 Araunah said to David, "Let my lord the king take whatever pleases him and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood.
102Sm 24:23 O king, Araunah gives all this to the king." Araunah also said to him, "May the LORD your God accept you."
102Sm 24:24 But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them.
102Sm 24:25 David built an altar to the LORD there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the LORD answered prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.
