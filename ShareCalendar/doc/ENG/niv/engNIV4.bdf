18
18Jb 1:1 In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil.
18Jb 1:2 He had seven sons and three daughters,
18Jb 1:3 and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
18Jb 1:4 His sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
18Jb 1:5 When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would send and have them purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, "Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular custom.
18Jb 1:6 One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them.
18Jb 1:7 The LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
18Jb 1:8 Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil."
18Jb 1:9 "Does Job fear God for nothing?" Satan replied.
18Jb 1:10 "Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land.
18Jb 1:11 But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face."
18Jb 1:12 The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, everything he has is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
18Jb 1:13 One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
18Jb 1:14 a messenger came to Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,
18Jb 1:15 and the Sabeans attacked and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:16 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:17 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, "The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:18 While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, "Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother's house,
18Jb 1:19 when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:20 At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship
18Jb 1:21 and said£º "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I will depart. The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised."
18Jb 1:22 In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing.
18Jb 2:1 On another day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him.
18Jb 2:2 And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it."
18Jb 2:3 Then the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason."
18Jb 2:4 "Skin for skin!" Satan replied. "A man will give all he has for his own life.
18Jb 2:5 But stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face."
18Jb 2:6 The LORD said to Satan, "Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life."
18Jb 2:7 So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.
18Jb 2:8 Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.
18Jb 2:9 His wife said to him, "Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!"
18Jb 2:10 He replied, "You are talking like a foolish woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?" In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
18Jb 2:11 When Job's three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him.
18Jb 2:12 When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads.
18Jb 2:13 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.
18Jb 3:1 After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
18Jb 3:2 He said£º
18Jb 3:3 "May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, 'A boy is born!'
18Jb 3:4 That day--may it turn to darkness; may God above not care about it; may no light shine upon it.
18Jb 3:5 May darkness and deep shadow claim it once more; may a cloud settle over it; may blackness overwhelm its light.
18Jb 3:6 That night--may thick darkness seize it; may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months.
18Jb 3:7 May that night be barren; may no shout of joy be heard in it.
18Jb 3:8 May those who curse days curse that day, those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
18Jb 3:9 May its morning stars become dark; may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn,
18Jb 3:10 for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes.
18Jb 3:11 "Why did I not perish at birth, and die as I came from the womb?
18Jb 3:12 Why were there knees to receive me and breasts that I might be nursed?
18Jb 3:13 For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest
18Jb 3:14 with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves places now lying in ruins,
18Jb 3:15 with rulers who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
18Jb 3:16 Or why was I not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child, like an infant who never saw the light of day?
18Jb 3:17 There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest.
18Jb 3:18 Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout.
18Jb 3:19 The small and the great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.
18Jb 3:20 "Why is light given to those in misery, and life to the bitter of soul,
18Jb 3:21 to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,
18Jb 3:22 who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?
18Jb 3:23 Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?
18Jb 3:24 For sighing comes to me instead of food; my groans pour out like water.
18Jb 3:25 What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me.
18Jb 3:26 I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil."
18Jb 4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied£º
18Jb 4:2 "If someone ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? But who can keep from speaking?
18Jb 4:3 Think how you have instructed many, how you have strengthened feeble hands.
18Jb 4:4 Your words have supported those who stumbled; you have strengthened faltering knees.
18Jb 4:5 But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged; it strikes you, and you are dismayed.
18Jb 4:6 Should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope?
18Jb 4:7 "Consider now£º Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Where were the upright ever destroyed?
18Jb 4:8 As I have observed, those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it.
18Jb 4:9 At the breath of God they are destroyed; at the blast of his anger they perish.
18Jb 4:10 The lions may roar and growl, yet the teeth of the great lions are broken.
18Jb 4:11 The lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
18Jb 4:12 "A word was secretly brought to me, my ears caught a whisper of it.
18Jb 4:13 Amid disquieting dreams in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,
18Jb 4:14 fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake.
18Jb 4:15 A spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body stood on end.
18Jb 4:16 It stopped, but I could not tell what it was. A form stood before my eyes, and I heard a hushed voice£º
18Jb 4:17 'Can a mortal be more righteous than God? Can a man be more pure than his Maker?
18Jb 4:18 If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error,
18Jb 4:19 how much more those who live in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who are crushed more readily than a moth!
18Jb 4:20 Between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces; unnoticed, they perish forever.
18Jb 4:21 Are not the cords of their tent pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?'
18Jb 5:1 "Call if you will, but who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?
18Jb 5:2 Resentment kills a fool, and envy slays the simple.
18Jb 5:3 I myself have seen a fool taking root, but suddenly his house was cursed.
18Jb 5:4 His children are far from safety, crushed in court without a defender.
18Jb 5:5 The hungry consume his harvest, taking it even from among thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth.
18Jb 5:6 For hardship does not spring from the soil, nor does trouble sprout from the ground.
18Jb 5:7 Yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward.
18Jb 5:8 "But if it were I, I would appeal to God; I would lay my cause before him.
18Jb 5:9 He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
18Jb 5:10 He bestows rain on the earth; he sends water upon the countryside.
18Jb 5:11 The lowly he sets on high, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.
18Jb 5:12 He thwarts the plans of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.
18Jb 5:13 He catches the wise in their craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are swept away.
18Jb 5:14 Darkness comes upon them in the daytime; at noon they grope as in the night.
18Jb 5:15 He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth; he saves them from the clutches of the powerful.
18Jb 5:16 So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts its mouth.
18Jb 5:17 "Blessed is the man whom God corrects; so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.
18Jb 5:18 For he wounds, but he also binds up; he injures, but his hands also heal.
18Jb 5:19 From six calamities he will rescue you; in seven no harm will befall you.
18Jb 5:20 In famine he will ransom you from death, and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
18Jb 5:21 You will be protected from the lash of the tongue, and need not fear when destruction comes.
18Jb 5:22 You will laugh at destruction and famine, and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
18Jb 5:23 For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
18Jb 5:24 You will know that your tent is secure; you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing.
18Jb 5:25 You will know that your children will be many, and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
18Jb 5:26 You will come to the grave in full vigor, like sheaves gathered in season.
18Jb 5:27 "We have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself."
18Jb 6:1 Then Job replied£º
18Jb 6:2 "If only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales!
18Jb 6:3 It would surely outweigh the sand of the seas--no wonder my words have been impetuous.
18Jb 6:4 The arrows of the Almighty are in me, my spirit drinks in their poison; God's terrors are marshaled against me.
18Jb 6:5 Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass, or an ox bellow when it has fodder?
18Jb 6:6 Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?
18Jb 6:7 I refuse to touch it; such food makes me ill.
18Jb 6:8 "Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant what I hope for,
18Jb 6:9 that God would be willing to crush me, to let loose his hand and cut me off!
18Jb 6:10 Then I would still have this consolation--my joy in unrelenting pain--that I had not denied the words of the Holy One.
18Jb 6:11 "What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What prospects, that I should be patient?
18Jb 6:12 Do I have the strength of stone? Is my flesh bronze?
18Jb 6:13 Do I have any power to help myself, now that success has been driven from me?
18Jb 6:14 "A despairing man should have the devotion of his friends, even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
18Jb 6:15 But my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams, as the streams that overflow
18Jb 6:16 when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow,
18Jb 6:17 but that cease to flow in the dry season, and in the heat vanish from their channels.
18Jb 6:18 Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go up into the wasteland and perish.
18Jb 6:19 The caravans of Tema look for water, the traveling merchants of Sheba look in hope.
18Jb 6:20 They are distressed, because they had been confident; they arrive there, only to be disappointed.
18Jb 6:21 Now you too have proved to be of no help; you see something dreadful and are afraid.
18Jb 6:22 Have I ever said, 'Give something on my behalf, pay a ransom for me from your wealth,
18Jb 6:23 deliver me from the hand of the enemy, ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless'?
18Jb 6:24 "Teach me, and I will be quiet; show me where I have been wrong.
18Jb 6:25 How painful are honest words! But what do your arguments prove?
18Jb 6:26 Do you mean to correct what I say, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind?
18Jb 6:27 You would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend.
18Jb 6:28 "But now be so kind as to look at me. Would I lie to your face?
18Jb 6:29 Relent, do not be unjust; reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.
18Jb 6:30 Is there any wickedness on my lips? Can my mouth not discern malice?
18Jb 7:1 "Does not man have hard service on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired man?
18Jb 7:2 Like a slave longing for the evening shadows, or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages,
18Jb 7:3 so I have been allotted months of futility, and nights of misery have been assigned to me.
18Jb 7:4 When I lie down I think, 'How long before I get up?' The night drags on, and I toss till dawn.
18Jb 7:5 My body is clothed with worms and scabs, my skin is broken and festering.
18Jb 7:6 "My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they come to an end without hope.
18Jb 7:7 Remember, O God, that my life is but a breath; my eyes will never see happiness again.
18Jb 7:8 The eye that now sees me will see me no longer; you will look for me, but I will be no more.
18Jb 7:9 As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.
18Jb 7:10 He will never come to his house again; his place will know him no more.
18Jb 7:11 "Therefore I will not keep silent; I will speak out in the anguish of my spirit, I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
18Jb 7:12 Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that you put me under guard?
18Jb 7:13 When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,
18Jb 7:14 even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,
18Jb 7:15 so that I prefer strangling and death, rather than this body of mine.
18Jb 7:16 I despise my life; I would not live forever. Let me alone; my days have no meaning.
18Jb 7:17 "What is man that you make so much of him, that you give him so much attention,
18Jb 7:18 that you examine him every morning and test him every moment?
18Jb 7:19 Will you never look away from me, or let me alone even for an instant?
18Jb 7:20 If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of men? Why have you made me your target? Have I become a burden to you?
18Jb 7:21 Why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins? For I will soon lie down in the dust; you will search for me, but I will be no more."
18Jb 8:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied£º
18Jb 8:2 "How long will you say such things? Your words are a blustering wind.
18Jb 8:3 Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
18Jb 8:4 When your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin.
18Jb 8:5 But if you will look to God and plead with the Almighty,
18Jb 8:6 if you are pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place.
18Jb 8:7 Your beginnings will seem humble, so prosperous will your future be.
18Jb 8:8 "Ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned,
18Jb 8:9 for we were born only yesterday and know nothing, and our days on earth are but a shadow.
18Jb 8:10 Will they not instruct you and tell you? Will they not bring forth words from their understanding?
18Jb 8:11 Can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds thrive without water?
18Jb 8:12 While still growing and uncut, they wither more quickly than grass.
18Jb 8:13 Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so perishes the hope of the godless.
18Jb 8:14 What he trusts in is fragile; what he relies on is a spider's web.
18Jb 8:15 He leans on his web, but it gives way; he clings to it, but it does not hold.
18Jb 8:16 He is like a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden;
18Jb 8:17 it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones.
18Jb 8:18 But when it is torn from its spot, that place disowns it and says, 'I never saw you.'
18Jb 8:19 Surely its life withers away, and from the soil other plants grow.
18Jb 8:20 "Surely God does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers.
18Jb 8:21 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
18Jb 8:22 Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tents of the wicked will be no more."
18Jb 9:1 Then Job replied£º
18Jb 9:2 "Indeed, I know that this is true. But how can a mortal be righteous before God?
18Jb 9:3 Though one wished to dispute with him, he could not answer him one time out of a thousand.
18Jb 9:4 His wisdom is profound, his power is vast. Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?
18Jb 9:5 He moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger.
18Jb 9:6 He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble.
18Jb 9:7 He speaks to the sun and it does not shine; he seals off the light of the stars.
18Jb 9:8 He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.
18Jb 9:9 He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
18Jb 9:10 He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed, miracles that cannot be counted.
18Jb 9:11 When he passes me, I cannot see him; when he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
18Jb 9:12 If he snatches away, who can stop him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'
18Jb 9:13 God does not restrain his anger; even the cohorts of Rahab cowered at his feet.
18Jb 9:14 "How then can I dispute with him? How can I find words to argue with him?
18Jb 9:15 Though I were innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my Judge for mercy.
18Jb 9:16 Even if I summoned him and he responded, I do not believe he would give me a hearing.
18Jb 9:17 He would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason.
18Jb 9:18 He would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery.
18Jb 9:19 If it is a matter of strength, he is mighty! And if it is a matter of justice, who will summon him?
18Jb 9:20 Even if I were innocent, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would pronounce me guilty.
18Jb 9:21 "Although I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.
18Jb 9:22 It is all the same; that is why I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'
18Jb 9:23 When a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks the despair of the innocent.
18Jb 9:24 When a land falls into the hands of the wicked, he blindfolds its judges. If it is not he, then who is it?
18Jb 9:25 "My days are swifter than a runner; they fly away without a glimpse of joy.
18Jb 9:26 They skim past like boats of papyrus, like eagles swooping down on their prey.
18Jb 9:27 If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression, and smile,'
18Jb 9:28 I still dread all my sufferings, for I know you will not hold me innocent.
18Jb 9:29 Since I am already found guilty, why should I struggle in vain?
18Jb 9:30 Even if I washed myself with soap and my hands with washing soda,
18Jb 9:31 you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me.
18Jb 9:32 "He is not a man like me that I might answer him, that we might confront each other in court.
18Jb 9:33 If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both,
18Jb 9:34 someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more.
18Jb 9:35 Then I would speak up without fear of him, but as it now stands with me, I cannot.
18Jb 10:1 "I loathe my very life; therefore I will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul.
18Jb 10:2 I will say to God£º Do not condemn me, but tell me what charges you have against me.
18Jb 10:3 Does it please you to oppress me, to spurn the work of your hands, while you smile on the schemes of the wicked?
18Jb 10:4 Do you have eyes of flesh? Do you see as a mortal sees?
18Jb 10:5 Are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a man,
18Jb 10:6 that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin--
18Jb 10:7 though you know that I am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand?
18Jb 10:8 "Your hands shaped me and made me. Will you now turn and destroy me?
18Jb 10:9 Remember that you molded me like clay. Will you now turn me to dust again?
18Jb 10:10 Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese,
18Jb 10:11 clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews?
18Jb 10:12 You gave me life and showed me kindness, and in your providence watched over my spirit.
18Jb 10:13 "But this is what you concealed in your heart, and I know that this was in your mind£º
18Jb 10:14 If I sinned, you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished.
18Jb 10:15 If I am guilty--woe to me! Even if I am innocent, I cannot lift my head, for I am full of shame and drowned in my affliction.
18Jb 10:16 If I hold my head high, you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me.
18Jb 10:17 You bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me; your forces come against me wave upon wave.
18Jb 10:18 "Why then did you bring me out of the womb? I wish I had died before any eye saw me.
18Jb 10:19 If only I had never come into being, or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave!
18Jb 10:20 Are not my few days almost over? Turn away from me so I can have a moment's joy
18Jb 10:21 before I go to the place of no return, to the land of gloom and deep shadow,
18Jb 10:22 to the land of deepest night, of deep shadow and disorder, where even the light is like darkness."
18Jb 11:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite replied£º
18Jb 11:2 "Are all these words to go unanswered? Is this talker to be vindicated?
18Jb 11:3 Will your idle talk reduce men to silence? Will no one rebuke you when you mock?
18Jb 11:4 You say to God, 'My beliefs are flawless and I am pure in your sight.'
18Jb 11:5 Oh, how I wish that God would speak, that he would open his lips against you
18Jb 11:6 and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know this£º God has even forgotten some of your sin.
18Jb 11:7 "Can you fathom the mysteries of God? Can you probe the limits of the Almighty?
18Jb 11:8 They are higher than the heavens--what can you do? They are deeper than the depths of the grave--what can you know?
18Jb 11:9 Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.
18Jb 11:10 "If he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court, who can oppose him?
18Jb 11:11 Surely he recognizes deceitful men; and when he sees evil, does he not take note?
18Jb 11:12 But a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkey's colt can be born a man.
18Jb 11:13 "Yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him,
18Jb 11:14 if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent,
18Jb 11:15 then you will lift up your face without shame; you will stand firm and without fear.
18Jb 11:16 You will surely forget your trouble, recalling it only as waters gone by.
18Jb 11:17 Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning.
18Jb 11:18 You will be secure, because there is hope; you will look about you and take your rest in safety.
18Jb 11:19 You will lie down, with no one to make you afraid, and many will court your favor.
18Jb 11:20 But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; their hope will become a dying gasp."
18Jb 12:1 Then Job replied£º
18Jb 12:2 "Doubtless you are the people, and wisdom will die with you!
18Jb 12:3 But I have a mind as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know all these things?
18Jb 12:4 "I have become a laughingstock to my friends, though I called upon God and he answered--a mere laughingstock, though righteous and blameless!
18Jb 12:5 Men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.
18Jb 12:6 The tents of marauders are undisturbed, and those who provoke God are secure--those who carry their god in their hands.
18Jb 12:7 "But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you;
18Jb 12:8 or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you.
18Jb 12:9 Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?
18Jb 12:10 In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.
18Jb 12:11 Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food?
18Jb 12:12 Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding?
18Jb 12:13 "To God belong wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his.
18Jb 12:14 What he tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man he imprisons cannot be released.
18Jb 12:15 If he holds back the waters, there is drought; if he lets them loose, they devastate the land.
18Jb 12:16 To him belong strength and victory; both deceived and deceiver are his.
18Jb 12:17 He leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges.
18Jb 12:18 He takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist.
18Jb 12:19 He leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established.
18Jb 12:20 He silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders.
18Jb 12:21 He pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.
18Jb 12:22 He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light.
18Jb 12:23 He makes nations great, and destroys them; he enlarges nations, and disperses them.
18Jb 12:24 He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason; he sends them wandering through a trackless waste.
18Jb 12:25 They grope in darkness with no light; he makes them stagger like drunkards.
18Jb 13:1 "My eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it.
18Jb 13:2 What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
18Jb 13:3 But I desire to speak to the Almighty and to argue my case with God.
18Jb 13:4 You, however, smear me with lies; you are worthless physicians, all of you!
18Jb 13:5 If only you would be altogether silent! For you, that would be wisdom.
18Jb 13:6 Hear now my argument; listen to the plea of my lips.
18Jb 13:7 Will you speak wickedly on God's behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him?
18Jb 13:8 Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God?
18Jb 13:9 Would it turn out well if he examined you? Could you deceive him as you might deceive men?
18Jb 13:10 He would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.
18Jb 13:11 Would not his splendor terrify you? Would not the dread of him fall on you?
18Jb 13:12 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.
18Jb 13:13 "Keep silent and let me speak; then let come to me what may.
18Jb 13:14 Why do I put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands?
18Jb 13:15 Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him; I will surely defend my ways to his face.
18Jb 13:16 Indeed, this will turn out for my deliverance, for no godless man would dare come before him!
18Jb 13:17 Listen carefully to my words; let your ears take in what I say.
18Jb 13:18 Now that I have prepared my case, I know I will be vindicated.
18Jb 13:19 Can anyone bring charges against me? If so, I will be silent and die.
18Jb 13:20 "Only grant me these two things, O God, and then I will not hide from you£º
18Jb 13:21 Withdraw your hand far from me, and stop frightening me with your terrors.
18Jb 13:22 Then summon me and I will answer, or let me speak, and you reply.
18Jb 13:23 How many wrongs and sins have I committed? Show me my offense and my sin.
18Jb 13:24 Why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy?
18Jb 13:25 Will you torment a windblown leaf? Will you chase after dry chaff?
18Jb 13:26 For you write down bitter things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth.
18Jb 13:27 You fasten my feet in shackles; you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet.
18Jb 13:28 "So man wastes away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths.
18Jb 14:1 "Man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble.
18Jb 14:2 He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.
18Jb 14:3 Do you fix your eye on such a one? Will you bring him before you for judgment?
18Jb 14:4 Who can bring what is pure from the impure? No one!
18Jb 14:5 Man's days are determined; you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed.
18Jb 14:6 So look away from him and let him alone, till he has put in his time like a hired man.
18Jb 14:7 "At least there is hope for a tree£º If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail.
18Jb 14:8 Its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil,
18Jb 14:9 yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant.
18Jb 14:10 But man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last and is no more.
18Jb 14:11 As water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry,
18Jb 14:12 so man lies down and does not rise; till the heavens are no more, men will not awake or be roused from their sleep.
18Jb 14:13 "If only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed! If only you would set me a time and then remember me!
18Jb 14:14 If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait for my renewal to come.
18Jb 14:15 You will call and I will answer you; you will long for the creature your hands have made.
18Jb 14:16 Surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin.
18Jb 14:17 My offenses will be sealed up in a bag; you will cover over my sin.
18Jb 14:18 "But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place,
18Jb 14:19 as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope.
18Jb 14:20 You overpower him once for all, and he is gone; you change his countenance and send him away.
18Jb 14:21 If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it.
18Jb 14:22 He feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself."
18Jb 15:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied£º
18Jb 15:2 "Would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind?
18Jb 15:3 Would he argue with useless words, with speeches that have no value?
18Jb 15:4 But you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to God.
18Jb 15:5 Your sin prompts your mouth; you adopt the tongue of the crafty.
18Jb 15:6 Your own mouth condemns you, not mine; your own lips testify against you.
18Jb 15:7 "Are you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?
18Jb 15:8 Do you listen in on God's council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?
18Jb 15:9 What do you know that we do not know? What insights do you have that we do not have?
18Jb 15:10 The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men even older than your father.
18Jb 15:11 Are God's consolations not enough for you, words spoken gently to you?
18Jb 15:12 Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,
18Jb 15:13 so that you vent your rage against God and pour out such words from your mouth?
18Jb 15:14 "What is man, that he could be pure, or one born of woman, that he could be righteous?
18Jb 15:15 If God places no trust in his holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes,
18Jb 15:16 how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks up evil like water!
18Jb 15:17 "Listen to me and I will explain to you; let me tell you what I have seen,
18Jb 15:18 what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received from their fathers
18Jb 15:19 (to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them)£º
18Jb 15:20 All his days the wicked man suffers torment, the ruthless through all the years stored up for him.
18Jb 15:21 Terrifying sounds fill his ears; when all seems well, marauders attack him.
18Jb 15:22 He despairs of escaping the darkness; he is marked for the sword.
18Jb 15:23 He wanders about--food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.
18Jb 15:24 Distress and anguish fill him with terror; they overwhelm him, like a king poised to attack,
18Jb 15:25 because he shakes his fist at God and vaunts himself against the Almighty,
18Jb 15:26 defiantly charging against him with a thick, strong shield.
18Jb 15:27 "Though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh,
18Jb 15:28 he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives, houses crumbling to rubble.
18Jb 15:29 He will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the land.
18Jb 15:30 He will not escape the darkness; a flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God's mouth will carry him away.
18Jb 15:31 Let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless, for he will get nothing in return.
18Jb 15:32 Before his time he will be paid in full, and his branches will not flourish.
18Jb 15:33 He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.
18Jb 15:34 For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes.
18Jb 15:35 They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb fashions deceit."
18Jb 16:1 Then Job replied£º
18Jb 16:2 "I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all!
18Jb 16:3 Will your long-winded speeches never end? What ails you that you keep on arguing?
18Jb 16:4 I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you.
18Jb 16:5 But my mouth would encourage you; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.
18Jb 16:6 "Yet if I speak, my pain is not relieved; and if I refrain, it does not go away.
18Jb 16:7 Surely, O God, you have worn me out; you have devastated my entire household.
18Jb 16:8 You have bound me--and it has become a witness; my gauntness rises up and testifies against me.
18Jb 16:9 God assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.
18Jb 16:10 Men open their mouths to jeer at me; they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me.
18Jb 16:11 God has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked.
18Jb 16:12 All was well with me, but he shattered me; he seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target;
18Jb 16:13 his archers surround me. Without pity, he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground.
18Jb 16:14 Again and again he bursts upon me; he rushes at me like a warrior.
18Jb 16:15 "I have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust.
18Jb 16:16 My face is red with weeping, deep shadows ring my eyes;
18Jb 16:17 yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure.
18Jb 16:18 "O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry never be laid to rest!
18Jb 16:19 Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high.
18Jb 16:20 My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God;
18Jb 16:21 on behalf of a man he pleads with God as a man pleads for his friend.
18Jb 16:22 "Only a few years will pass before I go on the journey of no return.
18Jb 17:1 My spirit is broken, my days are cut short, the grave awaits me.
18Jb 17:2 Surely mockers surround me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility.
18Jb 17:3 "Give me, O God, the pledge you demand. Who else will put up security for me?
18Jb 17:4 You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore you will not let them triumph.
18Jb 17:5 If a man denounces his friends for reward, the eyes of his children will fail.
18Jb 17:6 "God has made me a byword to everyone, a man in whose face people spit.
18Jb 17:7 My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow.
18Jb 17:8 Upright men are appalled at this; the innocent are aroused against the ungodly.
18Jb 17:9 Nevertheless, the righteous will hold to their ways, and those with clean hands will grow stronger.
18Jb 17:10 "But come on, all of you, try again! I will not find a wise man among you.
18Jb 17:11 My days have passed, my plans are shattered, and so are the desires of my heart.
18Jb 17:12 These men turn night into day; in the face of darkness they say, 'Light is near.'
18Jb 17:13 If the only home I hope for is the grave, if I spread out my bed in darkness,
18Jb 17:14 if I say to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother' or 'My sister,'
18Jb 17:15 where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?
18Jb 17:16 Will it go down to the gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?"
18Jb 18:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied£º
18Jb 18:2 "When will you end these speeches? Be sensible, and then we can talk.
18Jb 18:3 Why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight?
18Jb 18:4 You who tear yourself to pieces in your anger, is the earth to be abandoned for your sake? Or must the rocks be moved from their place?
18Jb 18:5 "The lamp of the wicked is snuffed out; the flame of his fire stops burning.
18Jb 18:6 The light in his tent becomes dark; the lamp beside him goes out.
18Jb 18:7 The vigor of his step is weakened; his own schemes throw him down.
18Jb 18:8 His feet thrust him into a net and he wanders into its mesh.
18Jb 18:9 A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare holds him fast.
18Jb 18:10 A noose is hidden for him on the ground; a trap lies in his path.
18Jb 18:11 Terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step.
18Jb 18:12 Calamity is hungry for him; disaster is ready for him when he falls.
18Jb 18:13 It eats away parts of his skin; death's firstborn devours his limbs.
18Jb 18:14 He is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors.
18Jb 18:15 Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling.
18Jb 18:16 His roots dry up below and his branches wither above.
18Jb 18:17 The memory of him perishes from the earth; he has no name in the land.
18Jb 18:18 He is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world.
18Jb 18:19 He has no offspring or descendants among his people, no survivor where once he lived.
18Jb 18:20 Men of the west are appalled at his fate; men of the east are seized with horror.
18Jb 18:21 Surely such is the dwelling of an evil man; such is the place of one who knows not God."
18Jb 19:1 Then Job replied£º
18Jb 19:2 "How long will you torment me and crush me with words?
18Jb 19:3 Ten times now you have reproached me; shamelessly you attack me.
18Jb 19:4 If it is true that I have gone astray, my error remains my concern alone.
18Jb 19:5 If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me,
18Jb 19:6 then know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me.
18Jb 19:7 "Though I cry, 'I've been wronged!' I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.
18Jb 19:8 He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; he has shrouded my paths in darkness.
18Jb 19:9 He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
18Jb 19:10 He tears me down on every side till I am gone; he uproots my hope like a tree.
18Jb 19:11 His anger burns against me; he counts me among his enemies.
18Jb 19:12 His troops advance in force; they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent.
18Jb 19:13 "He has alienated my brothers from me; my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.
18Jb 19:14 My kinsmen have gone away; my friends have forgotten me.
18Jb 19:15 My guests and my maidservants count me a stranger; they look upon me as an alien.
18Jb 19:16 I summon my servant, but he does not answer, though I beg him with my own mouth.
18Jb 19:17 My breath is offensive to my wife; I am loathsome to my own brothers.
18Jb 19:18 Even the little boys scorn me; when I appear, they ridicule me.
18Jb 19:19 All my intimate friends detest me; those I love have turned against me.
18Jb 19:20 I am nothing but skin and bones; I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth.
18Jb 19:21 "Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.
18Jb 19:22 Why do you pursue me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?
18Jb 19:23 "Oh, that my words were recorded, that they were written on a scroll,
18Jb 19:24 that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead, or engraved in rock forever!
18Jb 19:25 I know that my Redeemer lives, and that in the end he will stand upon the earth.
18Jb 19:26 And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God;
18Jb 19:27 I myself will see him with my own eyes--I, and not another. How my heart yearns within me!
18Jb 19:28 "If you say, 'How we will hound him, since the root of the trouble lies in him,'
18Jb 19:29 you should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment."
18Jb 20:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite replied£º
18Jb 20:2 "My troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because I am greatly disturbed.
18Jb 20:3 I hear a rebuke that dishonors me, and my understanding inspires me to reply.
18Jb 20:4 "Surely you know how it has been from of old, ever since man was placed on the earth,
18Jb 20:5 that the mirth of the wicked is brief, the joy of the godless lasts but a moment.
18Jb 20:6 Though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds,
18Jb 20:7 he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?'
18Jb 20:8 Like a dream he flies away, no more to be found, banished like a vision of the night.
18Jb 20:9 The eye that saw him will not see him again; his place will look on him no more.
18Jb 20:10 His children must make amends to the poor; his own hands must give back his wealth.
18Jb 20:11 The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust.
18Jb 20:12 "Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue,
18Jb 20:13 though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,
18Jb 20:14 yet his food will turn sour in his stomach; it will become the venom of serpents within him.
18Jb 20:15 He will spit out the riches he swallowed; God will make his stomach vomit them up.
18Jb 20:16 He will suck the poison of serpents; the fangs of an adder will kill him.
18Jb 20:17 He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
18Jb 20:18 What he toiled for he must give back uneaten; he will not enjoy the profit from his trading.
18Jb 20:19 For he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute; he has seized houses he did not build.
18Jb 20:20 "Surely he will have no respite from his craving; he cannot save himself by his treasure.
18Jb 20:21 Nothing is left for him to devour; his prosperity will not endure.
18Jb 20:22 In the midst of his plenty, distress will overtake him; the full force of misery will come upon him.
18Jb 20:23 When he has filled his belly, God will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows upon him.
18Jb 20:24 Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow pierces him.
18Jb 20:25 He pulls it out of his back, the gleaming point out of his liver. Terrors will come over him;
18Jb 20:26 total darkness lies in wait for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.
18Jb 20:27 The heavens will expose his guilt; the earth will rise up against him.
18Jb 20:28 A flood will carry off his house, rushing waters on the day of God's wrath.
18Jb 20:29 Such is the fate God allots the wicked, the heritage appointed for them by God."
18Jb 21:1 Then Job replied£º
18Jb 21:2 "Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you give me.
18Jb 21:3 Bear with me while I speak, and after I have spoken, mock on.
18Jb 21:4 "Is my complaint directed to man? Why should I not be impatient?
18Jb 21:5 Look at me and be astonished; clap your hand over your mouth.
18Jb 21:6 When I think about this, I am terrified; trembling seizes my body.
18Jb 21:7 Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?
18Jb 21:8 They see their children established around them, their offspring before their eyes.
18Jb 21:9 Their homes are safe and free from fear; the rod of God is not upon them.
18Jb 21:10 Their bulls never fail to breed; their cows calve and do not miscarry.
18Jb 21:11 They send forth their children as a flock; their little ones dance about.
18Jb 21:12 They sing to the music of tambourine and harp; they make merry to the sound of the flute.
18Jb 21:13 They spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace.
18Jb 21:14 Yet they say to God, 'Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways.
18Jb 21:15 Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain by praying to him?'
18Jb 21:16 But their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.
18Jb 21:17 "Yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out? How often does calamity come upon them, the fate God allots in his anger?
18Jb 21:18 How often are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a gale?
18Jb 21:19 It is said,'God stores up a man's punishment for his sons.' Let him repay the man himself, so that he will know it!
18Jb 21:20 Let his own eyes see his destruction; let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
18Jb 21:21 For what does he care about the family he leaves behind when his allotted months come to an end?
18Jb 21:22 "Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since he judges even the highest?
18Jb 21:23 One man dies in full vigor, completely secure and at ease,
18Jb 21:24 his body well nourished, his bones rich with marrow.
18Jb 21:25 Another man dies in bitterness of soul, never having enjoyed anything good.
18Jb 21:26 Side by side they lie in the dust, and worms cover them both.
18Jb 21:27 "I know full well what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me.
18Jb 21:28 You say, 'Where now is the great man's house, the tents where wicked men lived?'
18Jb 21:29 Have you never questioned those who travel? Have you paid no regard to their accounts--
18Jb 21:30 that the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, that he is delivered from the day of wrath?
18Jb 21:31 Who denounces his conduct to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?
18Jb 21:32 He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.
18Jb 21:33 The soil in the valley is sweet to him; all men follow after him, and a countless throng goes before him.
18Jb 21:34 "So how can you console me with your nonsense? Nothing is left of your answers but falsehood!"
18Jb 22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied£º
18Jb 22:2 "Can a man be of benefit to God? Can even a wise man benefit him?
18Jb 22:3 What pleasure would it give the Almighty if you were righteous? What would he gain if your ways were blameless?
18Jb 22:4 "Is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you?
18Jb 22:5 Is not your wickedness great? Are not your sins endless?
18Jb 22:6 You demanded security from your brothers for no reason; you stripped men of their clothing, leaving them naked.
18Jb 22:7 You gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry,
18Jb 22:8 though you were a powerful man, owning land--an honored man, living on it.
18Jb 22:9 And you sent widows away empty-handed and broke the strength of the fatherless.
18Jb 22:10 That is why snares are all around you, why sudden peril terrifies you,
18Jb 22:11 why it is so dark you cannot see, and why a flood of water covers you.
18Jb 22:12 "Is not God in the heights of heaven? And see how lofty are the highest stars!
18Jb 22:13 Yet you say, 'What does God know? Does he judge through such darkness?
18Jb 22:14 Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens.'
18Jb 22:15 Will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod?
18Jb 22:16 They were carried off before their time, their foundations washed away by a flood.
18Jb 22:17 They said to God, 'Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'
18Jb 22:18 Yet it was he who filled their houses with good things, so I stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked.
18Jb 22:19 "The righteous see their ruin and rejoice; the innocent mock them, saying,
18Jb 22:20 'Surely our foes are destroyed, and fire devours their wealth.'
18Jb 22:21 "Submit to God and be at peace with him; in this way prosperity will come to you.
18Jb 22:22 Accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart.
18Jb 22:23 If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored£º If you remove wickedness far from your tent
18Jb 22:24 and assign your nuggets to the dust, your gold of Ophir to the rocks in the ravines,
18Jb 22:25 then the Almighty will be your gold, the choicest silver for you.
18Jb 22:26 Surely then you will find delight in the Almighty and will lift up your face to God.
18Jb 22:27 You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows.
18Jb 22:28 What you decide on will be done, and light will shine on your ways.
18Jb 22:29 When men are brought low and you say, 'Lift them up!' then he will save the downcast.
18Jb 22:30 He will deliver even one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."
18Jb 23:1 Then Job replied£º
18Jb 23:2 "Even today my complaint is bitter; his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.
18Jb 23:3 If only I knew where to find him; if only I could go to his dwelling!
18Jb 23:4 I would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
18Jb 23:5 I would find out what he would answer me, and consider what he would say.
18Jb 23:6 Would he oppose me with great power? No, he would not press charges against me.
18Jb 23:7 There an upright man could present his case before him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.
18Jb 23:8 "But if I go to the east, he is not there; if I go to the west, I do not find him.
18Jb 23:9 When he is at work in the north, I do not see him; when he turns to the south, I catch no glimpse of him.
18Jb 23:10 But he knows the way that I take; when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold.
18Jb 23:11 My feet have closely followed his steps; I have kept to his way without turning aside.
18Jb 23:12 I have not departed from the commands of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread.
18Jb 23:13 "But he stands alone, and who can oppose him? He does whatever he pleases.
18Jb 23:14 He carries out his decree against me, and many such plans he still has in store.
18Jb 23:15 That is why I am terrified before him; when I think of all this, I fear him.
18Jb 23:16 God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.
18Jb 23:17 Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.
18Jb 24:1 "Why does the Almighty not set times for judgment? Why must those who know him look in vain for such days?
18Jb 24:2 Men move boundary stones; they pasture flocks they have stolen.
18Jb 24:3 They drive away the orphan's donkey and take the widow's ox in pledge.
18Jb 24:4 They thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
18Jb 24:5 Like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go about their labor of foraging food; the wasteland provides food for their children.
18Jb 24:6 They gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
18Jb 24:7 Lacking clothes, they spend the night naked; they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold.
18Jb 24:8 They are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter.
18Jb 24:9 The fatherless child is snatched from the breast; the infant of the poor is seized for a debt.
18Jb 24:10 Lacking clothes, they go about naked; they carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
18Jb 24:11 They crush olives among the terraces; they tread the winepresses, yet suffer thirst.
18Jb 24:12 The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out for help. But God charges no one with wrongdoing.
18Jb 24:13 "There are those who rebel against the light, who do not know its ways or stay in its paths.
18Jb 24:14 When daylight is gone, the murderer rises up and kills the poor and needy; in the night he steals forth like a thief.
18Jb 24:15 The eye of the adulterer watches for dusk; he thinks, 'No eye will see me,' and he keeps his face concealed.
18Jb 24:16 In the dark, men break into houses, but by day they shut themselves in; they want nothing to do with the light.
18Jb 24:17 For all of them, deep darkness is their morning; they make friends with the terrors of darkness.
18Jb 24:18 "Yet they are foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one goes to the vineyards.
18Jb 24:19 As heat and drought snatch away the melted snow, so the grave snatches away those who have sinned.
18Jb 24:20 The womb forgets them, the worm feasts on them; evil men are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree.
18Jb 24:21 They prey on the barren and childless woman, and to the widow show no kindness.
18Jb 24:22 But God drags away the mighty by his power; though they become established, they have no assurance of life.
18Jb 24:23 He may let them rest in a feeling of security, but his eyes are on their ways.
18Jb 24:24 For a little while they are exalted, and then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.
18Jb 24:25 "If this is not so, who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing?"
18Jb 25:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied£º
18Jb 25:2 "Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven.
18Jb 25:3 Can his forces be numbered? Upon whom does his light not rise?
18Jb 25:4 How then can a man be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure?
18Jb 25:5 If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes,
18Jb 25:6 how much less man, who is but a maggot--a son of man, who is only a worm!"
18Jb 26:1 Then Job replied£º
18Jb 26:2 "How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the arm that is feeble!
18Jb 26:3 What advice you have offered to one without wisdom! And what great insight you have displayed!
18Jb 26:4 Who has helped you utter these words? And whose spirit spoke from your mouth?
18Jb 26:5 "The dead are in deep anguish, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.
18Jb 26:6 Death is naked before God; Destruction lies uncovered.
18Jb 26:7 He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth over nothing.
18Jb 26:8 He wraps up the waters in his clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their weight.
18Jb 26:9 He covers the face of the full moon, spreading his clouds over it.
18Jb 26:10 He marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness.
18Jb 26:11 The pillars of the heavens quake, aghast at his rebuke.
18Jb 26:12 By his power he churned up the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab to pieces.
18Jb 26:13 By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent.
18Jb 26:14 And these are but the outer fringe of his works; how faint the whisper we hear of him! Who then can understand the thunder of his power?"
18Jb 27:1 And Job continued his discourse£º
18Jb 27:2 "As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made me taste bitterness of soul,
18Jb 27:3 as long as I have life within me, the breath of God in my nostrils,
18Jb 27:4 my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will utter no deceit.
18Jb 27:5 I will never admit you are in the right; till I die, I will not deny my integrity.
18Jb 27:6 I will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it; my conscience will not reproach me as long as I live.
18Jb 27:7 "May my enemies be like the wicked, my adversaries like the unjust!
18Jb 27:8 For what hope has the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?
18Jb 27:9 Does God listen to his cry when distress comes upon him?
18Jb 27:10 Will he find delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?
18Jb 27:11 "I will teach you about the power of God; the ways of the Almighty I will not conceal.
18Jb 27:12 You have all seen this yourselves. Why then this meaningless talk?
18Jb 27:13 "Here is the fate God allots to the wicked, the heritage a ruthless man receives from the Almighty£º
18Jb 27:14 However many his children, their fate is the sword; his offspring will never have enough to eat.
18Jb 27:15 The plague will bury those who survive him, and their widows will not weep for them.
18Jb 27:16 Though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay,
18Jb 27:17 what he lays up the righteous will wear, and the innocent will divide his silver.
18Jb 27:18 The house he builds is like a moth's cocoon, like a hut made by a watchman.
18Jb 27:19 He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.
18Jb 27:20 Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest snatches him away in the night.
18Jb 27:21 The east wind carries him off, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.
18Jb 27:22 It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.
18Jb 27:23 It claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place.
18Jb 28:1 "There is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.
18Jb 28:2 Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.
18Jb 28:3 Man puts an end to the darkness; he searches the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness.
18Jb 28:4 Far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft, in places forgotten by the foot of man; far from men he dangles and sways.
18Jb 28:5 The earth, from which food comes, is transformed below as by fire;
18Jb 28:6 sapphires come from its rocks, and its dust contains nuggets of gold.
18Jb 28:7 No bird of prey knows that hidden path, no falcon's eye has seen it.
18Jb 28:8 Proud beasts do not set foot on it, and no lion prowls there.
18Jb 28:9 Man's hand assaults the flinty rock and lays bare the roots of the mountains.
18Jb 28:10 He tunnels through the rock; his eyes see all its treasures.
18Jb 28:11 He searches the sources of the rivers and brings hidden things to light.
18Jb 28:12 "But where can wisdom be found? Where does understanding dwell?
18Jb 28:13 Man does not comprehend its worth; it cannot be found in the land of the living.
18Jb 28:14 The deep says, 'It is not in me'; the sea says, 'It is not with me.'
18Jb 28:15 It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor can its price be weighed in silver.
18Jb 28:16 It cannot be bought with the gold of Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires.
18Jb 28:17 Neither gold nor crystal can compare with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold.
18Jb 28:18 Coral and jasper are not worthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.
18Jb 28:19 The topaz of Cush cannot compare with it; it cannot be bought with pure gold.
18Jb 28:20 "Where then does wisdom come from? Where does understanding dwell?
18Jb 28:21 It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing, concealed even from the birds of the air.
18Jb 28:22 Destruction and Death say, 'Only a rumor of it has reached our ears.'
18Jb 28:23 God understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells,
18Jb 28:24 for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.
18Jb 28:25 When he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters,
18Jb 28:26 when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm,
18Jb 28:27 then he looked at wisdom and appraised it; he confirmed it and tested it.
18Jb 28:28 And he said to man, 'The fear of the Lord--that is wisdom, and to shun evil is understanding.'"
18Jb 29:1 Job continued his discourse£º
18Jb 29:2 "How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,
18Jb 29:3 when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light I walked through darkness!
18Jb 29:4 Oh, for the days when I was in my prime, when God's intimate friendship blessed my house,
18Jb 29:5 when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,
18Jb 29:6 when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil.
18Jb 29:7 "When I went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square,
18Jb 29:8 the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet;
18Jb 29:9 the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands;
18Jb 29:10 the voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
18Jb 29:11 Whoever heard me spoke well of me, and those who saw me commended me,
18Jb 29:12 because I rescued the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to assist him.
18Jb 29:13 The man who was dying blessed me; I made the widow's heart sing.
18Jb 29:14 I put on righteousness as my clothing; justice was my robe and my turban.
18Jb 29:15 I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
18Jb 29:16 I was a father to the needy; I took up the case of the stranger.
18Jb 29:17 I broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth.
18Jb 29:18 "I thought, 'I will die in my own house, my days as numerous as the grains of sand.
18Jb 29:19 My roots will reach to the water, and the dew will lie all night on my branches.
18Jb 29:20 My glory will remain fresh in me, the bow ever new in my hand.'
18Jb 29:21 "Men listened to me expectantly, waiting in silence for my counsel.
18Jb 29:22 After I had spoken, they spoke no more; my words fell gently on their ears.
18Jb 29:23 They waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain.
18Jb 29:24 When I smiled at them, they scarcely believed it; the light of my face was precious to them.
18Jb 29:25 I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I dwelt as a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.
18Jb 30:1 "But now they mock me, men younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.
18Jb 30:2 Of what use was the strength of their hands to me, since their vigor had gone from them?
18Jb 30:3 Haggard from want and hunger, they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night.
18Jb 30:4 In the brush they gathered salt herbs, and their food was the root of the broom tree.
18Jb 30:5 They were banished from their fellow men, shouted at as if they were thieves.
18Jb 30:6 They were forced to live in the dry stream beds, among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
18Jb 30:7 They brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth.
18Jb 30:8 A base and nameless brood, they were driven out of the land.
18Jb 30:9 "And now their sons mock me in song; I have become a byword among them.
18Jb 30:10 They detest me and keep their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face.
18Jb 30:11 Now that God has unstrung my bow and afflicted me, they throw off restraint in my presence.
18Jb 30:12 On my right the tribe attacks; they lay snares for my feet, they build their siege ramps against me.
18Jb 30:13 They break up my road; they succeed in destroying me--without anyone's helping them.
18Jb 30:14 They advance as through a gaping breach; amid the ruins they come rolling in.
18Jb 30:15 Terrors overwhelm me; my dignity is driven away as by the wind, my safety vanishes like a cloud.
18Jb 30:16 "And now my life ebbs away; days of suffering grip me.
18Jb 30:17 Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never rest.
18Jb 30:18 In his great power God becomes like clothing to me; he binds me like the neck of my garment.
18Jb 30:19 He throws me into the mud, and I am reduced to dust and ashes.
18Jb 30:20 "I cry out to you, O God, but you do not answer; I stand up, but you merely look at me.
18Jb 30:21 You turn on me ruthlessly; with the might of your hand you attack me.
18Jb 30:22 You snatch me up and drive me before the wind; you toss me about in the storm.
18Jb 30:23 I know you will bring me down to death, to the place appointed for all the living.
18Jb 30:24 "Surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress.
18Jb 30:25 Have I not wept for those in trouble? Has not my soul grieved for the poor?
18Jb 30:26 Yet when I hoped for good, evil came; when I looked for light, then came darkness.
18Jb 30:27 The churning inside me never stops; days of suffering confront me.
18Jb 30:28 I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help.
18Jb 30:29 I have become a brother of jackals, a companion of owls.
18Jb 30:30 My skin grows black and peels; my body burns with fever.
18Jb 30:31 My harp is tuned to mourning, and my flute to the sound of wailing.
18Jb 31:1 "I made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl.
18Jb 31:2 For what is man's lot from God above, his heritage from the Almighty on high?
18Jb 31:3 Is it not ruin for the wicked, disaster for those who do wrong?
18Jb 31:4 Does he not see my ways and count my every step?
18Jb 31:5 "If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit--
18Jb 31:6 let God weigh me in honest scales and he will know that I am blameless--
18Jb 31:7 if my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has been led by my eyes, or if my hands have been defiled,
18Jb 31:8 then may others eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.
18Jb 31:9 "If my heart has been enticed by a woman, or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door,
18Jb 31:10 then may my wife grind another man's grain, and may other men sleep with her.
18Jb 31:11 For that would have been shameful, a sin to be judged.
18Jb 31:12 It is a fire that burns to Destruction; it would have uprooted my harvest.
18Jb 31:13 "If I have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants when they had a grievance against me,
18Jb 31:14 what will I do when God confronts me? What will I answer when called to account?
18Jb 31:15 Did not he who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us both within our mothers?
18Jb 31:16 "If I have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary,
18Jb 31:17 if I have kept my bread to myself, not sharing it with the fatherless--
18Jb 31:18 but from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my birth I guided the widow--
18Jb 31:19 if I have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a garment,
18Jb 31:20 and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep,
18Jb 31:21 if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, knowing that I had influence in court,
18Jb 31:22 then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let it be broken off at the joint.
18Jb 31:23 For I dreaded destruction from God, and for fear of his splendor I could not do such things.
18Jb 31:24 "If I have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security,'
18Jb 31:25 if I have rejoiced over my great wealth, the fortune my hands had gained,
18Jb 31:26 if I have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,
18Jb 31:27 so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage,
18Jb 31:28 then these also would be sins to be judged, for I would have been unfaithful to God on high.
18Jb 31:29 "If I have rejoiced at my enemy's misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him--
18Jb 31:30 I have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against his life--
18Jb 31:31 if the men of my household have never said, 'Who has not had his fill of Job's meat?'--
18Jb 31:32 but no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveler--
18Jb 31:33 if I have concealed my sin as men do, by hiding my guilt in my heart
18Jb 31:34 because I so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that I kept silent and would not go outside
18Jb 31:35 ("Oh, that I had someone to hear me! I sign now my defense--let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser put his indictment in writing.
18Jb 31:36 Surely I would wear it on my shoulder, I would put it on like a crown.
18Jb 31:37 I would give him an account of my every step; like a prince I would approach him.)--
18Jb 31:38 "if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears,
18Jb 31:39 if I have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,
18Jb 31:40 then let briers come up instead of wheat and weeds instead of barley." The words of Job are ended.
18Jb 32:1 So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
18Jb 32:2 But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry with Job for justifying himself rather than God.
18Jb 32:3 He was also angry with the three friends, because they had found no way to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
18Jb 32:4 Now Elihu had waited before speaking to Job because they were older than he.
18Jb 32:5 But when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say, his anger was aroused.
18Jb 32:6 So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said£º "I am young in years, and you are old; that is why I was fearful, not daring to tell you what I know.
18Jb 32:7 I thought, 'Age should speak; advanced years should teach wisdom.'
18Jb 32:8 But it is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.
18Jb 32:9 It is not only the old who are wise, not only the aged who understand what is right.
18Jb 32:10 "Therefore I say£º Listen to me; I too will tell you what I know.
18Jb 32:11 I waited while you spoke, I listened to your reasoning; while you were searching for words,
18Jb 32:12 I gave you my full attention. But not one of you has proved Job wrong; none of you has answered his arguments.
18Jb 32:13 Do not say, 'We have found wisdom; let God refute him, not man.'
18Jb 32:14 But Job has not marshaled his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.
18Jb 32:15 "They are dismayed and have no more to say; words have failed them.
18Jb 32:16 Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand there with no reply?
18Jb 32:17 I too will have my say; I too will tell what I know.
18Jb 32:18 For I am full of words, and the spirit within me compels me;
18Jb 32:19 inside I am like bottled-up wine, like new wineskins ready to burst.
18Jb 32:20 I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and reply.
18Jb 32:21 I will show partiality to no one, nor will I flatter any man;
18Jb 32:22 for if I were skilled in flattery, my Maker would soon take me away.
18Jb 33:1 "But now, Job, listen to my words; pay attention to everything I say.
18Jb 33:2 I am about to open my mouth; my words are on the tip of my tongue.
18Jb 33:3 My words come from an upright heart; my lips sincerely speak what I know.
18Jb 33:4 The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
18Jb 33:5 Answer me then, if you can; prepare yourself and confront me.
18Jb 33:6 I am just like you before God; I too have been taken from clay.
18Jb 33:7 No fear of me should alarm you, nor should my hand be heavy upon you.
18Jb 33:8 "But you have said in my hearing--I heard the very words--
18Jb 33:9 'I am pure and without sin; I am clean and free from guilt.
18Jb 33:10 Yet God has found fault with me; he considers me his enemy.
18Jb 33:11 He fastens my feet in shackles; he keeps close watch on all my paths.'
18Jb 33:12 "But I tell you, in this you are not right, for God is greater than man.
18Jb 33:13 Why do you complain to him that he answers none of man's words?
18Jb 33:14 For God does speak--now one way, now another--though man may not perceive it.
18Jb 33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds,
18Jb 33:16 he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings,
18Jb 33:17 to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,
18Jb 33:18 to preserve his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword.
18Jb 33:19 Or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones,
18Jb 33:20 so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal.
18Jb 33:21 His flesh wastes away to nothing, and his bones, once hidden, now stick out.
18Jb 33:22 His soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the messengers of death.
18Jb 33:23 "Yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator, one out of a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,
18Jb 33:24 to be gracious to him and say, 'Spare him from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom for him'--
18Jb 33:25 then his flesh is renewed like a child's; it is restored as in the days of his youth.
18Jb 33:26 He prays to God and finds favor with him, he sees God's face and shouts for joy; he is restored by God to his righteous state.
18Jb 33:27 Then he comes to men and says, 'I sinned, and perverted what was right, but I did not get what I deserved.
18Jb 33:28 He redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and I will live to enjoy the light.'
18Jb 33:29 "God does all these things to a man--twice, even three times--
18Jb 33:30 to turn back his soul from the pit, that the light of life may shine on him.
18Jb 33:31 "Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.
18Jb 33:32 If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, for I want you to be cleared.
18Jb 33:33 But if not, then listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
18Jb 34:1 Then Elihu said£º
18Jb 34:2 "Hear my words, you wise men; listen to me, you men of learning.
18Jb 34:3 For the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food.
18Jb 34:4 Let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.
18Jb 34:5 "Job says, 'I am innocent, but God denies me justice.
18Jb 34:6 Although I am right, I am considered a liar; although I am guiltless, his arrow inflicts an incurable wound.'
18Jb 34:7 What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water?
18Jb 34:8 He keeps company with evildoers; he associates with wicked men.
18Jb 34:9 For he says, 'It profits a man nothing when he tries to please God.'
18Jb 34:10 "So listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do evil, from the Almighty to do wrong.
18Jb 34:11 He repays a man for what he has done; he brings upon him what his conduct deserves.
18Jb 34:12 It is unthinkable that God would do wrong, that the Almighty would pervert justice.
18Jb 34:13 Who appointed him over the earth? Who put him in charge of the whole world?
18Jb 34:14 If it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath,
18Jb 34:15 all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust.
18Jb 34:16 "If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say.
18Jb 34:17 Can he who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One?
18Jb 34:18 Is he not the One who says to kings, 'You are worthless,' and to nobles, 'You are wicked,'
18Jb 34:19 who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor, for they are all the work of his hands?
18Jb 34:20 They die in an instant, in the middle of the night; the people are shaken and they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.
18Jb 34:21 "His eyes are on the ways of men; he sees their every step.
18Jb 34:22 There is no dark place, no deep shadow, where evildoers can hide.
18Jb 34:23 God has no need to examine men further, that they should come before him for judgment.
18Jb 34:24 Without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place.
18Jb 34:25 Because he takes note of their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
18Jb 34:26 He punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them,
18Jb 34:27 because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways.
18Jb 34:28 They caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he heard the cry of the needy.
18Jb 34:29 But if he remains silent, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, who can see him? Yet he is over man and nation alike,
18Jb 34:30 to keep a godless man from ruling, from laying snares for the people.
18Jb 34:31 "Suppose a man says to God, 'I am guilty but will offend no more.
18Jb 34:32 Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do so again.'
18Jb 34:33 Should God then reward you on your terms, when you refuse to repent? You must decide, not I; so tell me what you know.
18Jb 34:34 "Men of understanding declare, wise men who hear me say to me,
18Jb 34:35 'Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.'
18Jb 34:36 Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man!
18Jb 34:37 To his sin he adds rebellion; scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God."
18Jb 35:1 Then Elihu said£º
18Jb 35:2 "Do you think this is just? You say, 'I will be cleared by God.'
18Jb 35:3 Yet you ask him, 'What profit is it to me, and what do I gain by not sinning?'
18Jb 35:4 "I would like to reply to you and to your friends with you.
18Jb 35:5 Look up at the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds so high above you.
18Jb 35:6 If you sin, how does that affect him? If your sins are many, what does that do to him?
18Jb 35:7 If you are righteous, what do you give to him, or what does he receive from your hand?
18Jb 35:8 Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only the sons of men.
18Jb 35:9 "Men cry out under a load of oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful.
18Jb 35:10 But no one says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,
18Jb 35:11 who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?'
18Jb 35:12 He does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked.
18Jb 35:13 Indeed, God does not listen to their empty plea; the Almighty pays no attention to it.
18Jb 35:14 How much less, then, will he listen when you say that you do not see him, that your case is before him and you must wait for him,
18Jb 35:15 and further, that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness.
18Jb 35:16 So Job opens his mouth with empty talk; without knowledge he multiplies words."
18Jb 36:1 Elihu continued£º
18Jb 36:2 "Bear with me a little longer and I will show you that there is more to be said in God's behalf.
18Jb 36:3 I get my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
18Jb 36:4 Be assured that my words are not false; one perfect in knowledge is with you.
18Jb 36:5 "God is mighty, but does not despise men; he is mighty, and firm in his purpose.
18Jb 36:6 He does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights.
18Jb 36:7 He does not take his eyes off the righteous; he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.
18Jb 36:8 But if men are bound in chains, held fast by cords of affliction,
18Jb 36:9 he tells them what they have done--that they have sinned arrogantly.
18Jb 36:10 He makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil.
18Jb 36:11 If they obey and serve him, they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment.
18Jb 36:12 But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.
18Jb 36:13 "The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when he fetters them, they do not cry for help.
18Jb 36:14 They die in their youth, among male prostitutes of the shrines.
18Jb 36:15 But those who suffer he delivers in their suffering; he speaks to them in their affliction.
18Jb 36:16 "He is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction, to the comfort of your table laden with choice food.
18Jb 36:17 But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have taken hold of you.
18Jb 36:18 Be careful that no one entices you by riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside.
18Jb 36:19 Would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress?
18Jb 36:20 Do not long for the night, to drag people away from their homes.
18Jb 36:21 Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction.
18Jb 36:22 "God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?
18Jb 36:23 Who has prescribed his ways for him, or said to him, 'You have done wrong'?
18Jb 36:24 Remember to extol his work, which men have praised in song.
18Jb 36:25 All mankind has seen it; men gaze on it from afar.
18Jb 36:26 How great is God--beyond our understanding! The number of his years is past finding out.
18Jb 36:27 "He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain to the streams;
18Jb 36:28 the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind.
18Jb 36:29 Who can understand how he spreads out the clouds, how he thunders from his pavilion?
18Jb 36:30 See how he scatters his lightning about him, bathing the depths of the sea.
18Jb 36:31 This is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance.
18Jb 36:32 He fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.
18Jb 36:33 His thunder announces the coming storm; even the cattle make known its approach.
18Jb 37:1 "At this my heart pounds and leaps from its place.
18Jb 37:2 Listen! Listen to the roar of his voice, to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
18Jb 37:3 He unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth.
18Jb 37:4 After that comes the sound of his roar; he thunders with his majestic voice. When his voice resounds, he holds nothing back.
18Jb 37:5 God's voice thunders in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding.
18Jb 37:6 He says to the snow, 'Fall on the earth,' and to the rain shower, 'Be a mighty downpour.'
18Jb 37:7 So that all men he has made may know his work, he stops every man from his labor.
18Jb 37:8 The animals take cover; they remain in their dens.
18Jb 37:9 The tempest comes out from its chamber, the cold from the driving winds.
18Jb 37:10 The breath of God produces ice, and the broad waters become frozen.
18Jb 37:11 He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through them.
18Jb 37:12 At his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them.
18Jb 37:13 He brings the clouds to punish men, or to water his earth and show his love.
18Jb 37:14 "Listen to this, Job; stop and consider God's wonders.
18Jb 37:15 Do you know how God controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash?
18Jb 37:16 Do you know how the clouds hang poised, those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge?
18Jb 37:17 You who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind,
18Jb 37:18 can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?
18Jb 37:19 "Tell us what we should say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.
18Jb 37:20 Should he be told that I want to speak? Would any man ask to be swallowed up?
18Jb 37:21 Now no one can look at the sun, bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.
18Jb 37:22 Out of the north he comes in golden splendor; God comes in awesome majesty.
18Jb 37:23 The Almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power; in his justice and great righteousness, he does not oppress.
18Jb 37:24 Therefore, men revere him, for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart?"
18Jb 38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the storm. He said£º
18Jb 38:2 "Who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge?
18Jb 38:3 Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
18Jb 38:4 "Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me, if you understand.
18Jb 38:5 Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! Who stretched a measuring line across it?
18Jb 38:6 On what were its footings set, or who laid its cornerstone--
18Jb 38:7 while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?
18Jb 38:8 "Who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb,
18Jb 38:9 when I made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness,
18Jb 38:10 when I fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place,
18Jb 38:11 when I said, 'This far you may come and no farther; here is where your proud waves halt'?
18Jb 38:12 "Have you ever given orders to the morning, or shown the dawn its place,
18Jb 38:13 that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it?
18Jb 38:14 The earth takes shape like clay under a seal; its features stand out like those of a garment.
18Jb 38:15 The wicked are denied their light, and their upraised arm is broken.
18Jb 38:16 "Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep?
18Jb 38:17 Have the gates of death been shown to you? Have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?
18Jb 38:18 Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth? Tell me, if you know all this.
18Jb 38:19 "What is the way to the abode of light? And where does darkness reside?
18Jb 38:20 Can you take them to their places? Do you know the paths to their dwellings?
18Jb 38:21 Surely you know, for you were already born! You have lived so many years!
18Jb 38:22 "Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail,
18Jb 38:23 which I reserve for times of trouble, for days of war and battle?
18Jb 38:24 What is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed, or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth?
18Jb 38:25 Who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain, and a path for the thunderstorm,
18Jb 38:26 to water a land where no man lives, a desert with no one in it,
18Jb 38:27 to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass?
18Jb 38:28 Does the rain have a father? Who fathers the drops of dew?
18Jb 38:29 From whose womb comes the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens
18Jb 38:30 when the waters become hard as stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen?
18Jb 38:31 "Can you bind the beautiful Pleiades? Can you loose the cords of Orion?
18Jb 38:32 Can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the Bear with its cubs?
18Jb 38:33 Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you set up God'sdominion over the earth?
18Jb 38:34 "Can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water?
18Jb 38:35 Do you send the lightning bolts on their way? Do they report to you, 'Here we are'?
18Jb 38:36 Who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind?
18Jb 38:37 Who has the wisdom to count the clouds? Who can tip over the water jars of the heavens
18Jb 38:38 when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together?
18Jb 38:39 "Do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions
18Jb 38:40 when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket?
18Jb 38:41 Who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to God and wander about for lack of food?
18Jb 39:1 "Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears her fawn?
18Jb 39:2 Do you count the months till they bear? Do you know the time they give birth?
18Jb 39:3 They crouch down and bring forth their young; their labor pains are ended.
18Jb 39:4 Their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds; they leave and do not return.
18Jb 39:5 "Who let the wild donkey go free? Who untied his ropes?
18Jb 39:6 I gave him the wasteland as his home, the salt flats as his habitat.
18Jb 39:7 He laughs at the commotion in the town; he does not hear a driver's shout.
18Jb 39:8 He ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing.
18Jb 39:9 "Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?
18Jb 39:10 Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he till the valleys behind you?
18Jb 39:11 Will you rely on him for his great strength? Will you leave your heavy work to him?
18Jb 39:12 Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?
18Jb 39:13 "The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork.
18Jb 39:14 She lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand,
18Jb 39:15 unmindful that a foot may crush them, that some wild animal may trample them.
18Jb 39:16 She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers; she cares not that her labor was in vain,
18Jb 39:17 for God did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense.
18Jb 39:18 Yet when she spreads her feathers to run, she laughs at horse and rider.
18Jb 39:19 "Do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?
18Jb 39:20 Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?
18Jb 39:21 He paws fiercely, rejoicing in his strength, and charges into the fray.
18Jb 39:22 He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing; he does not shy away from the sword.
18Jb 39:23 The quiver rattles against his side, along with the flashing spear and lance.
18Jb 39:24 In frenzied excitement he eats up the ground; he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds.
18Jb 39:25 At the blast of the trumpet he snorts, 'Aha!' He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shout of commanders and the battle cry.
18Jb 39:26 "Does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread his wings toward the south?
18Jb 39:27 Does the eagle soar at your command and build his nest on high?
18Jb 39:28 He dwells on a cliff and stays there at night; a rocky crag is his stronghold.
18Jb 39:29 From there he seeks out his food; his eyes detect it from afar.
18Jb 39:30 His young ones feast on blood, and where the slain are, there is he."
18Jb 40:1 The LORD said to Job£º
18Jb 40:2 "Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let him who accuses God answer him!"
18Jb 40:3 Then Job answered the LORD£º
18Jb 40:4 "I am unworthy--how can I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth.
18Jb 40:5 I spoke once, but I have no answer--twice, but I will say no more."
18Jb 40:6 Then the LORD spoke to Job out of the storm£º
18Jb 40:7 "Brace yourself like a man; I will question you, and you shall answer me.
18Jb 40:8 "Would you discredit my justice? Would you condemn me to justify yourself?
18Jb 40:9 Do you have an arm like God's, and can your voice thunder like his?
18Jb 40:10 Then adorn yourself with glory and splendor, and clothe yourself in honor and majesty.
18Jb 40:11 Unleash the fury of your wrath, look at every proud man and bring him low,
18Jb 40:12 look at every proud man and humble him, crush the wicked where they stand.
18Jb 40:13 Bury them all in the dust together; shroud their faces in the grave.
18Jb 40:14 Then I myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you.
18Jb 40:15 "Look at the behemoth, which I made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox.
18Jb 40:16 What strength he has in his loins, what power in the muscles of his belly!
18Jb 40:17 His tail sways like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are close-knit.
18Jb 40:18 His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like rods of iron.
18Jb 40:19 He ranks first among the works of God, yet his Maker can approach him with his sword.
18Jb 40:20 The hills bring him their produce, and all the wild animals play nearby.
18Jb 40:21 Under the lotus plants he lies, hidden among the reeds in the marsh.
18Jb 40:22 The lotuses conceal him in their shadow; the poplars by the stream surround him.
18Jb 40:23 When the river rages, he is not alarmed; he is secure, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.
18Jb 40:24 Can anyone capture him by the eyes, or trap him and pierce his nose?
18Jb 41:1 "Can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?
18Jb 41:2 Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
18Jb 41:3 Will he keep begging you for mercy? Will he speak to you with gentle words?
18Jb 41:4 Will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life?
18Jb 41:5 Can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls?
18Jb 41:6 Will traders barter for him? Will they divide him up among the merchants?
18Jb 41:7 Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?
18Jb 41:8 If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the struggle and never do it again!
18Jb 41:9 Any hope of subduing him is false; the mere sight of him is overpowering.
18Jb 41:10 No one is fierce enough to rouse him. Who then is able to stand against me?
18Jb 41:11 Who has a claim against me that I must pay? Everything under heaven belongs to me.
18Jb 41:12 "I will not fail to speak of his limbs, his strength and his graceful form.
18Jb 41:13 Who can strip off his outer coat? Who would approach him with a bridle?
18Jb 41:14 Who dares open the doors of his mouth, ringed about with his fearsome teeth?
18Jb 41:15 His back has rows of shields tightly sealed together;
18Jb 41:16 each is so close to the next that no air can pass between.
18Jb 41:17 They are joined fast to one another; they cling together and cannot be parted.
18Jb 41:18 His snorting throws out flashes of light; his eyes are like the rays of dawn.
18Jb 41:19 Firebrands stream from his mouth; sparks of fire shoot out.
18Jb 41:20 Smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.
18Jb 41:21 His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames dart from his mouth.
18Jb 41:22 Strength resides in his neck; dismay goes before him.
18Jb 41:23 The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.
18Jb 41:24 His chest is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone.
18Jb 41:25 When he rises up, the mighty are terrified; they retreat before his thrashing.
18Jb 41:26 The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin.
18Jb 41:27 Iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood.
18Jb 41:28 Arrows do not make him flee; slingstones are like chaff to him.
18Jb 41:29 A club seems to him but a piece of straw; he laughs at the rattling of the lance.
18Jb 41:30 His undersides are jagged potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.
18Jb 41:31 He makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment.
18Jb 41:32 Behind him he leaves a glistening wake; one would think the deep had white hair.
18Jb 41:33 Nothing on earth is his equal--a creature without fear.
18Jb 41:34 He looks down on all that are haughty; he is king over all that are proud."
18Jb 42:1 Then Job replied to the LORD£º
18Jb 42:2 "I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted.
18Jb 42:3 You asked,'Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.
18Jb 42:4 "You said,'Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.'
18Jb 42:5 My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you.
18Jb 42:6 Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."
18Jb 42:7 After the LORD had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.
18Jb 42:8 So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."
18Jb 42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the LORD told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.
18Jb 42:10 After Job had prayed for his friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before.
18Jb 42:11 All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.
18Jb 42:12 The LORD blessed the latter part of Job's life more than the first. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys.
18Jb 42:13 And he also had seven sons and three daughters.
18Jb 42:14 The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch.
18Jb 42:15 Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job's daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers.
18Jb 42:16 After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation.
18Jb 42:17 And so he died, old and full of years.
19

19Ps 34:14 Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
19Ps 34:15 The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their cry;
19Ps 34:16 the face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
19Ps 34:17 The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles.
19Ps 34:18 The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.

19Ps 34:20 he protects all his bones, not one of them will be broken.
19Ps 34:21 Evil will slay the wicked; the foes of the righteous will be condemned.
19Ps 34:22 The LORD redeems his servants; no one will be condemned who takes refuge in him.
19Ps 35:1 Of David. Contend, O LORD, with those who contend with me; fight against those who fight against me.
19Ps 35:2 Take up shield and buckler; arise and come to my aid.
19Ps 35:3 Brandish spear and javelin against those who pursue me. Say to my soul, "I am your salvation."
19Ps 35:4 May those who seek my life be disgraced and put to shame; may those who plot my ruin be turned back in dismay.
19Ps 35:5 May they be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the LORD driving them away;
19Ps 35:6 may their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the LORD pursuing them.
19Ps 35:7 Since they hid their net for me without cause and without cause dug a pit for me,
19Ps 35:8 may ruin overtake them by surprise--may the net they hid entangle them, may they fall into the pit, to their ruin.
19Ps 35:9 Then my soul will rejoice in the LORD and delight in his salvation.
19Ps 35:10 My whole being will exclaim, "Who is like you, O LORD? You rescue the poor from those too strong for them, the poor and needy from those who rob them."
19Ps 35:11 Ruthless witnesses come forward; they question me on things I know nothing about.
19Ps 35:12 They repay me evil for good and leave my soul forlorn.
19Ps 35:13 Yet when they were ill, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting. When my prayers returned to me unanswered,
19Ps 35:14 I went about mourning as though for my friend or brother. I bowed my head in grief as though weeping for my mother.
19Ps 35:15 But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee; attackers gathered against me when I was unaware. They slandered me without ceasing.
19Ps 35:16 Like the ungodly they maliciously mocked; they gnashed their teeth at me.
19Ps 35:17 O Lord, how long will you look on? Rescue my life from their ravages, my precious life from these lions.
19Ps 35:18 I will give you thanks in the great assembly; among throngs of people I will praise you.
19Ps 35:19 Let not those gloat over me who are my enemies without cause; let not those who hate me without reason maliciously wink the eye.
19Ps 35:20 They do not speak peaceably, but devise false accusations against those who live quietly in the land.
19Ps 35:21 They gape at me and say, "Aha! Aha! With our own eyes we have seen it."
19Ps 35:22 O LORD, you have seen this; be not silent. Do not be far from me, O Lord.
19Ps 35:23 Awake, and rise to my defense! Contend for me, my God and Lord.
19Ps 35:24 Vindicate me in your righteousness, O LORD my God; do not let them gloat over me.
19Ps 35:25 Do not let them think, "Aha, just what we wanted!" or say, "We have swallowed him up."
19Ps 35:26 May all who gloat over my distress be put to shame and confusion; may all who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and disgrace.

19Ps 35:28 My tongue will speak of your righteousness and of your praises all day long.
19Ps 36:1 For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD. An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of the wicked£º There is no fear of God before his eyes.
19Ps 36:2 For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin.
19Ps 36:3 The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and to do good.
19Ps 36:4 Even on his bed he plots evil; he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong.
19Ps 36:5 Your love, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness to the skies.
19Ps 36:6 Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your justice like the great deep. O LORD, you preserve both man and beast.
19Ps 36:7 How priceless is your unfailing love! Both high and low among men find refuge in the shadow of your wings.
19Ps 36:8 They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights.
19Ps 36:9 For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.

19Ps 37:7 Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for him; do not fret when men succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes.
19Ps 37:8 Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret--it leads only to evil.
19Ps 37:9 For evil men will be cut off, but those who hope in the LORD will inherit the land.
19Ps 37:10 A little while, and the wicked will be no more; though you look for them, they will not be found.
19Ps 37:11 But the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace.
19Ps 37:12 The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them;
19Ps 37:13 but the Lord laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
19Ps 37:14 The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose ways are upright.
19Ps 37:15 But their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.
19Ps 37:16 Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked;
19Ps 37:17 for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.
19Ps 37:18 The days of the blameless are known to the LORD, and their inheritance will endure forever.
19Ps 37:19 In times of disaster they will not wither; in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.
19Ps 37:20 But the wicked will perish£º The LORD'S enemies will be like the beauty of the fields, they will vanish--vanish like smoke.
19Ps 37:21 The wicked borrow and do not repay, but the righteous give generously;
19Ps 37:22 those the LORD blesses will inherit the land, but those he curses will be cut off.
19Ps 37:23 If the LORD delights in a man's way, he makes his steps firm;
19Ps 37:24 though he stumble, he will not fall, for the LORD upholds him with his hand.
19Ps 37:25 I was young and now I am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread.
19Ps 37:26 They are always generous and lend freely; their children will be blessed.
19Ps 37:27 Turn from evil and do good; then you will dwell in the land forever.
19Ps 37:28 For the LORD loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. They will be protected forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off;
19Ps 37:29 the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.
19Ps 37:30 The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks what is just.
19Ps 37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; his feet do not slip.
19Ps 37:32 The wicked lie in wait for the righteous, seeking their very lives;
19Ps 37:33 but the LORD will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial.
19Ps 37:34 Wait for the LORD and keep his way. He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.
19Ps 37:35 I have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil,
19Ps 37:36 but he soon passed away and was no more; though I looked for him, he could not be found.
19Ps 37:37 Consider the blameless, observe the upright; there is a future for the man of peace.
19Ps 37:38 But all sinners will be destroyed; the future of the wicked will be cut off.
19Ps 37:39 The salvation of the righteous comes from the LORD; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.
19Ps 37:40 The LORD helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in him.
19Ps 38:1 A psalm of David. A petition. O LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.

19Ps 38:8 I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.
19Ps 38:9 All my longings lie open before you, O Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you.
19Ps 38:10 My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes.
19Ps 38:11 My friends and companions avoid me because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away.
19Ps 38:12 Those who seek my life set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they plot deception.
19Ps 38:13 I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear, like a mute, who cannot open his mouth;
19Ps 38:14 I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply.
19Ps 38:15 I wait for you, O LORD; you will answer, O Lord my God.
19Ps 38:16 For I said, "Do not let them gloat or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."
19Ps 38:17 For I am about to fall, and my pain is ever with me.
19Ps 38:18 I confess my iniquity; I am troubled by my sin.
19Ps 38:19 Many are those who are my vigorous enemies; those who hate me without reason are numerous.
19Ps 38:20 Those who repay my good with evil slander me when I pursue what is good.

19Ps 39:1 For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David. I said, "I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will put a muzzle on my mouth as long as the wicked are in my presence."
19Ps 39:2 But when I was silent and still, not even saying anything good, my anguish increased.
19Ps 39:3 My heart grew hot within me, and as I meditated, the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue£º
19Ps 39:4 "Show me, O LORD, my life's end and the number of my days; let me know how fleeting is my life.

19Ps 39:6 Man is a mere phantom as he goes to and fro£º He bustles about, but only in vain; he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will get it.
19Ps 39:7 "But now, Lord, what do I look for? My hope is in you.
19Ps 39:8 Save me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of fools.
19Ps 39:9 I was silent; I would not open my mouth, for you are the one who has done this.
19Ps 39:10 Remove your scourge from me; I am overcome by the blow of your hand.

19Ps 39:13 Look away from me, that I may rejoice again before I depart and am no more."
19Ps 40:1 For the director of music. Of David. A psalm. I waited patiently for the LORD; he turned to me and heard my cry.
19Ps 40:2 He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand.
19Ps 40:3 He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.
19Ps 40:4 Blessed is the man who makes the LORD his trust, who does not look to the proud, to those who turn aside to false gods.
19Ps 40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are the wonders you have done. The things you planned for us no one can recount to you; were I to speak and tell of them, they would be too many to declare.
19Ps 40:6 Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but my ears you have pierced; burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not require.
19Ps 40:7 Then I said, "Here I am, I have come--it is written about me in the scroll.
19Ps 40:8 I desire to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."
19Ps 40:9 I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly; I do not seal my lips, as you know, O LORD.
19Ps 40:10 I do not hide your righteousness in my heart; I speak of your faithfulness and salvation. I do not conceal your love and your truth from the great assembly.
19Ps 40:11 Do not withhold your mercy from me, O LORD; may your love and your truth always protect me.
19Ps 40:12 For troubles without number surround me; my sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see. They are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails within me.
19Ps 40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to save me; O LORD, come quickly to help me.
19Ps 40:14 May all who seek to take my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.

19Ps 41:6 Whenever one comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it abroad.

19Ps 41:9 Even my close friend, whom I trusted, he who shared my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.

19Ps 42:3 My tears have been my food day and night, while men say to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
19Ps 42:4 These things I remember as I pour out my soul£º how I used to go with the multitude, leading the procession to the house of God, with shouts of joy and thanksgiving among the festive throng.
19Ps 42:5 Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and
19Ps 42:6 my God. My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon--from Mount Mizar.
19Ps 42:7 Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me.
19Ps 42:8 By day the LORD directs his love, at night his song is with me--a prayer to the God of my life.
19Ps 42:9 I say to God my Rock, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?"
19Ps 42:10 My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me, saying to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
19Ps 42:11 Why are you downcast, O my soul? Why so disturbed within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
19Ps 43:1 Vindicate me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; rescue me from deceitful and wicked men.
19Ps 43:2 You are God my stronghold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?

19Ps 43:4 Then will I go to the altar of God, to God, my joy and my delight. I will praise you with the harp, O God, my God.

19Ps 44:1 For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A maskil. We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us what you did in their days, in days long ago.
19Ps 44:2 With your hand you drove out the nations and planted our fathers; you crushed the peoples and made our fathers flourish.
19Ps 44:3 It was not by their sword that they won the land, nor did their arm bring them victory; it was your right hand, your arm, and the light of your face, for you loved them.
19Ps 44:4 You are my King and my God, who decrees victories for Jacob.
19Ps 44:5 Through you we push back our enemies; through your name we trample our foes.
19Ps 44:6 I do not trust in my bow, my sword does not bring me victory;
19Ps 44:7 but you give us victory over our enemies, you put our adversaries to shame.
19Ps 44:8 In God we make our boast all day long, and we will praise your name forever. Selah
19Ps 44:9 But now you have rejected and humbled us; you no longer go out with our armies.
19Ps 44:10 You made us retreat before the enemy, and our adversaries have plundered us.
19Ps 44:11 You gave us up to be devoured like sheep and have scattered us among the nations.
19Ps 44:12 You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale.
19Ps 44:13 You have made us a reproach to our neighbors, the scorn and derision of those around us.
19Ps 44:14 You have made us a byword among the nations; the peoples shake their heads at us.
19Ps 44:15 My disgrace is before me all day long, and my face is covered with shame
19Ps 44:16 at the taunts of those who reproach and revile me, because of the enemy, who is bent on revenge.
19Ps 44:17 All this happened to us, though we had not forgotten you or been false to your covenant.
19Ps 44:18 Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.
19Ps 44:19 But you crushed us and made us a haunt for jackals and covered us over with deep darkness.
19Ps 44:20 If we had forgotten the name of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god,
19Ps 44:21 would not God have discovered it, since he knows the secrets of the heart?
19Ps 44:22 Yet for your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
19Ps 44:23 Awake, O Lord! Why do you sleep? Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever.
19Ps 44:24 Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?
19Ps 44:25 We are brought down to the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.

19Ps 47:9 The nobles of the nations assemble as the people of the God of Abraham, for the kings of the earth belong to God; he is greatly exalted.
19Ps 48:1 A song. A psalm of the Sons of Korah. Great is the LORD, and most worthy of praise, in the city of our God, his holy mountain.
19Ps 48:2 It is beautiful in its loftiness, the joy of the whole earth. Like the utmost heights of Zaphon is Mount Zion, the city of the Great King.
19Ps 48:3 God is in her citadels; he has shown himself to be her fortress.
19Ps 48:4 When the kings joined forces, when they advanced together,
19Ps 48:5 they saw her and were astounded; they fled in terror.
19Ps 48:6 Trembling seized them there, pain like that of a woman in labor.
19Ps 48:7 You destroyed them like ships of Tarshish shattered by an east wind.
19Ps 48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD Almighty, in the city of our God£º God makes her secure forever. Selah

19Ps 49:1 For the director of music. Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm. Hear this, all you peoples; listen, all who live in this world,
19Ps 49:2 both low and high, rich and poor alike£º
19Ps 49:3 My mouth will speak words of wisdom; the utterance from my heart will give understanding.
19Ps 49:4 I will turn my ear to a proverb; with the harp I will expound my riddle£º
19Ps 49:5 Why should I fear when evil days come, when wicked deceivers surround me--
19Ps 49:6 those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches?
19Ps 49:7 No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him--
19Ps 49:8 the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough--
19Ps 49:9 that he should live on forever and not see decay.
19Ps 49:10 For all can see that wise men die; the foolish and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others.
19Ps 49:11 Their tombs will remain their houses forever, their dwellings for endless generations, though they had named lands after themselves.
19Ps 49:12 But man, despite his riches, does not endure; he is like the beasts that perish.
19Ps 49:13 This is the fate of those who trust in themselves, and of their followers, who approve their sayings. Selah
19Ps 49:14 Like sheep they are destined for the grave, and death will feed on them. The upright will rule over them in the morning; their forms will decay in the grave, far from their princely mansions.
19Ps 49:15 But God will redeem my life from the grave; he will surely take me to himself. Selah
19Ps 49:16 Do not be overawed when a man grows rich, when the splendor of his house increases;
19Ps 49:17 for he will take nothing with him when he dies, his splendor will not descend with him.
19Ps 49:18 Though while he lived he counted himself blessed--and men praise you when you prosper--
19Ps 49:19 he will join the generation of his fathers, who will never see the light of life.
19Ps 49:20 A man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish.
19Ps 50:1 A psalm of Asaph. The Mighty One, God, the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to the place where it sets.

19Ps 50:3 Our God comes and will not be silent; a fire devours before him, and around him a tempest rages.
19Ps 50:4 He summons the heavens above, and the earth, that he may judge his people£º
19Ps 50:5 "Gather to me my consecrated ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice."
19Ps 50:6 And the heavens proclaim his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah
19Ps 50:7 "Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, and I will testify against you£º I am God, your God.
19Ps 50:8 I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings, which are ever before me.
19Ps 50:9 I have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens,
19Ps 50:10 for every animal of the forest is mine, and the cattle on a thousand hills.
19Ps 50:11 I know every bird in the mountains, and the creatures of the field are mine.
19Ps 50:12 If I were hungry I would not tell you, for the world is mine, and all that is in it.
19Ps 50:13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
19Ps 50:14 Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High,
19Ps 50:15 and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me."
19Ps 50:16 But to the wicked, God says£º "What right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips?
19Ps 50:17 You hate my instruction and cast my words behind you.
19Ps 50:18 When you see a thief, you join with him; you throw in your lot with adulterers.
19Ps 50:19 You use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit.
19Ps 50:20 You speak continually against your brother and slander your own mother's son.
19Ps 50:21 These things you have done and I kept silent; you thought I was altogether like you. But I will rebuke you and accuse you to your face.
19Ps 50:22 "Consider this, you who forget God, or I will tear you to pieces, with none to rescue£º
19Ps 50:23 He who sacrifices thank offerings honors me, and he prepares the way so that I may show him the salvation of God."
19Ps 51:1 For the director of music. A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.
19Ps 51:2 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
19Ps 51:3 For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.
19Ps 51:4 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.
19Ps 51:5 Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.
19Ps 51:6 Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
19Ps 51:7 Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
19Ps 51:8 Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
19Ps 51:9 Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity.
19Ps 51:10 Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
19Ps 51:11 Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.
19Ps 51:12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit, to sustain me.
19Ps 51:13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will turn back to you.
19Ps 51:14 Save me from bloodguilt, O God, the God who saves me, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
19Ps 51:15 O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare your praise.
19Ps 51:16 You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.
19Ps 51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.
19Ps 51:18 In your good pleasure make Zion prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem.
19Ps 51:19 Then there will be righteous sacrifices, whole burnt offerings to delight you; then bulls will be offered on your altar.
19Ps 52:1 For the director of music. A maskil of David. When Doeg the Edomite had gone to Saul and told him£º "David has gone to the house of Ahimelech." Why do you boast of evil, you mighty man? Why do you boast all day long, you who are a disgrace in the eyes of God?
19Ps 52:2 Your tongue plots destruction; it is like a sharpened razor, you who practice deceit.
19Ps 52:3 You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than speaking the truth. Selah
19Ps 52:4 You love every harmful word, O you deceitful tongue!
19Ps 52:5 Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin£º He will snatch you up and tear you from your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living. Selah
19Ps 52:6 The righteous will see and fear; they will laugh at him, saying,
19Ps 52:7 "Here now is the man who did not make God his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others!"
19Ps 52:8 But I am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of God; I trust in God's unfailing love for ever and ever.
19Ps 52:9 I will praise you forever for what you have done; in your name I will hope, for your name is good. I will praise you in the presence of your saints.
19Ps 53:1 For the director of music. According to mahalath. A maskil of David. The fool says in his heart, "There is no God." They are corrupt, and their ways are vile; there is no one who does good.
19Ps 53:2 God looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand, any who seek God.
19Ps 53:3 Everyone has turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
19Ps 53:4 Will the evildoers never learn--those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on God?
19Ps 53:5 There they were, overwhelmed with dread, where there was nothing to dread. God scattered the bones of those who attacked you; you put them to shame, for God despised them.
19Ps 53:6 Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion! When God restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!
19Ps 54:1 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David. When the Ziphites had gone to Saul and said, "Is not David hiding among us?" Save me, O God, by your name; vindicate me by your might.
19Ps 54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth.
19Ps 54:3 Strangers are attacking me; ruthless men seek my life--men without regard for God. Selah
19Ps 54:4 Surely God is my help; the Lord is the one who sustains me.
19Ps 54:5 Let evil recoil on those who slander me; in your faithfulness destroy them.
19Ps 54:6 I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you; I will praise your name, O LORD, for it is good.
19Ps 54:7 For he has delivered me from all my troubles, and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes.
19Ps 55:1 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A maskil of David. Listen to my prayer, O God, do not ignore my plea;
19Ps 55:2 hear me and answer me. My thoughts trouble me and I am distraught
19Ps 55:3 at the voice of the enemy, at the stares of the wicked; for they bring down suffering upon me and revile me in their anger.
19Ps 55:4 My heart is in anguish within me; the terrors of death assail me.
19Ps 55:5 Fear and trembling have beset me; horror has overwhelmed me.
19Ps 55:6 I said, "Oh, that I had the wings of a dove! I would fly away and be at rest--
19Ps 55:7 I would flee far away and stay in the desert; Selah
19Ps 55:8 I would hurry to my place of shelter, far from the tempest and storm."
19Ps 55:9 Confuse the wicked, O Lord, confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city.
19Ps 55:10 Day and night they prowl about on its walls; malice and abuse are within it.
19Ps 55:11 Destructive forces are at work in the city; threats and lies never leave its streets.
19Ps 55:12 If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were raising himself against me, I could hide from him.
19Ps 55:13 But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend,
19Ps 55:14 with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship as we walked with the throng at the house of God.
19Ps 55:15 Let death take my enemies by surprise; let them go down alive to the grave, for evil finds lodging among them.
19Ps 55:16 But I call to God, and the LORD saves me.
19Ps 55:17 Evening, morning and noon I cry out in distress, and he hears my voice.
19Ps 55:18 He ransoms me unharmed from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.
19Ps 55:19 God, who is enthroned forever, will hear them and afflict them--Selah men who never change their ways and have no fear of God.
19Ps 55:20 My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.
19Ps 55:21 His speech is smooth as butter, yet war is in his heart; his words are more soothing than oil, yet they are drawn swords.
19Ps 55:22 Cast your cares on the LORD and he will sustain you; he will never let the righteous fall.
19Ps 55:23 But you, O God, will bring down the wicked into the pit of corruption; bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live out half their days. But as for me, I trust in you.
19Ps 56:1 For the director of music. To the tune of"A Dove on Distant Oaks." Of David. A miktam. When the Philistines had seized him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God, for men hotly pursue me; all day long they press their attack.
19Ps 56:2 My slanderers pursue me all day long; many are attacking me in their pride.
19Ps 56:3 When I am afraid, I will trust in you.
19Ps 56:4 In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can mortal man do to me?
19Ps 56:5 All day long they twist my words; they are always plotting to harm me.
19Ps 56:6 They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps, eager to take my life.
19Ps 56:7 On no account let them escape; in your anger, O God, bring down the nations.
19Ps 56:8 Record my lament; list my tears on your scroll--are they not in your record?
19Ps 56:9 Then my enemies will turn back when I call for help. By this I will know that God is for me.
19Ps 56:10 In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise--
19Ps 56:11 in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
19Ps 56:12 I am under vows to you, O God; I will present my thank offerings to you.
19Ps 56:13 For you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
19Ps 57:1 For the director of music. To the tune of"Do Not Destroy." Of David. A miktam. When he had fled from Saul into the cave. Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me, for in you my soul takes refuge. I will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed.
19Ps 57:2 I cry out to God Most High, to God, who fulfills his purpose for me.
19Ps 57:3 He sends from heaven and saves me, rebuking those who hotly pursue me; Selah God sends his love and his faithfulness.
19Ps 57:4 I am in the midst of lions; I lie among ravenous beasts--men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords.
19Ps 57:5 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
19Ps 57:6 They spread a net for my feet--I was bowed down in distress. They dug a pit in my path--but they have fallen into it themselves. Selah
19Ps 57:7 My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and make music.
19Ps 57:8 Awake, my soul! Awake, harp and lyre! I will awaken the dawn.
19Ps 57:9 I will praise you, O Lord, among the nations; I will sing of you among the peoples.
19Ps 57:10 For great is your love, reaching to the heavens; your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
19Ps 57:11 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; let your glory be over all the earth.
19Ps 58:1 For the director of music. To the tune of"Do Not Destroy." Of David. A miktam. Do you rulers indeed speak justly? Do you judge uprightly among men?
19Ps 58:2 No, in your heart you devise injustice, and your hands mete out violence on the earth.
19Ps 58:3 Even from birth the wicked go astray; from the womb they are wayward and speak lies.
19Ps 58:4 Their venom is like the venom of a snake, like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears,
19Ps 58:5 that will not heed the tune of the charmer, however skillful the enchanter may be.
19Ps 58:6 Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; tear out, O LORD, the fangs of the lions!
19Ps 58:7 Let them vanish like water that flows away; when they draw the bow, let their arrows be blunted.
19Ps 58:8 Like a slug melting away as it moves along, like a stillborn child, may they not see the sun.
19Ps 58:9 Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns--whether they be green or dry--the wicked will be swept away.
19Ps 58:10 The righteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
19Ps 58:11 Then men will say, "Surely the righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who judges the earth."
19Ps 59:1 For the director of music. To the tune of"Do Not Destroy." Of David. A miktam. When Saul had sent men to watch David's house in order to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O God; protect me from those who rise up against me.
19Ps 59:2 Deliver me from evildoers and save me from bloodthirsty men.
19Ps 59:3 See how they lie in wait for me! Fierce men conspire against me for no offense or sin of mine, O LORD.
19Ps 59:4 I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me. Arise to help me; look on my plight!
19Ps 59:5 O LORD God Almighty, the God of Israel, rouse yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to wicked traitors. Selah
19Ps 59:6 They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.
19Ps 59:7 See what they spew from their mouths--they spew out swords from their lips, and they say, "Who can hear us?"
19Ps 59:8 But you, O LORD, laugh at them; you scoff at all those nations.
19Ps 59:9 O my Strength, I watch for you; you, O God, are my fortress,
19Ps 59:10 my loving God. God will go before me and will let me gloat over those who slander me.
19Ps 59:11 But do not kill them, O Lord our shield, or my people will forget. In your might make them wander about, and bring them down.
19Ps 59:12 For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, let them be caught in their pride. For the curses and lies they utter,
19Ps 59:13 consume them in wrath, consume them till they are no more. Then it will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah
19Ps 59:14 They return at evening, snarling like dogs, and prowl about the city.
19Ps 59:15 They wander about for food and howl if not satisfied.
19Ps 59:16 But I will sing of your strength, in the morning I will sing of your love; for you are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.
19Ps 59:17 O my Strength, I sing praise to you; you, O God, are my fortress, my loving God.
19Ps 60:1 For the director of music. To the tune of"The Lily of the Covenant." A miktam of David. For teaching. When he fought Aram Naharaim and Aram Zobah, and when Joab returned and struck down twelve thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. You have rejected us, O God, and burst forth upon us; you have been angry--now restore us!
19Ps 60:2 You have shaken the land and torn it open; mend its fractures, for it is quaking.
19Ps 60:3 You have shown your people desperate times; you have given us wine that makes us stagger.
19Ps 60:4 But for those who fear you, you have raised a banner to be unfurled against the bow. Selah
19Ps 60:5 Save us and help us with your right hand, that those you love may be delivered.
19Ps 60:6 God has spoken from his sanctuary£º "In triumph I will parcel out Shechem and measure off the Valley of Succoth.
19Ps 60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my scepter.
19Ps 60:8 Moab is my washbasin, upon Edom I toss my sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph."
19Ps 60:9 Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
19Ps 60:10 Is it not you, O God, you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies?
19Ps 60:11 Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.
19Ps 60:12 With God we will gain the victory, and he will trample down our enemies.
19Ps 61:1 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. Of David. Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer.
19Ps 61:2 From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
19Ps 61:3 For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe.
19Ps 61:4 I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings. Selah
19Ps 61:5 For you have heard my vows, O God; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name.
19Ps 61:6 Increase the days of the king's life, his years for many generations.

19Ps 61:8 Then will I ever sing praise to your name and fulfill my vows day after day.
19Ps 62:1 For the director of music. For Jeduthun. A psalm of David. My soul finds rest in God alone; my salvation comes from him.
19Ps 62:2 He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will never be shaken.
19Ps 62:3 How long will you assault a man? Would all of you throw him down--this leaning wall, this tottering fence?
19Ps 62:4 They fully intend to topple him from his lofty place; they take delight in lies. With their mouths they bless, but in their hearts they curse. Selah
19Ps 62:5 Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; my hope comes from him.
19Ps 62:6 He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
19Ps 62:7 My salvation and my honor depend on God; he is my mighty rock, my refuge.

19Ps 62:9 Lowborn men are but a breath, the highborn are but a lie; if weighed on a balance, they are nothing; together they are only a breath.
19Ps 62:10 Do not trust in extortion or take pride in stolen goods; though your riches increase, do not set your heart on them.
19Ps 62:11 One thing God has spoken, two things have I heard£º that you, O God, are strong,
19Ps 62:12 and that you, O Lord, are loving. Surely you will reward each person according to what he has done.
19Ps 63:1 A psalm of David. When he was in the Desert of Judah. O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you; my soul thirsts for you, my body longs for you, in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
19Ps 63:2 I have seen you in the sanctuary and beheld your power and your glory.
19Ps 63:3 Because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.

19Ps 63:9 They who seek my life will be destroyed; they will go down to the depths of the earth.
19Ps 63:10 They will be given over to the sword and become food for jackals.

19Ps 64:2 Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, from that noisy crowd of evildoers.
19Ps 64:3 They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim their words like deadly arrows.
19Ps 64:4 They shoot from ambush at the innocent man; they shoot at him suddenly, without fear.
19Ps 64:5 They encourage each other in evil plans, they talk about hiding their snares; they say, "Who will see them?"
19Ps 64:6 They plot injustice and say, "We have devised a perfect plan!" Surely the mind and heart of man are cunning.
19Ps 64:7 But God will shoot them with arrows; suddenly they will be struck down.
19Ps 64:8 He will turn their own tongues against them and bring them to ruin; all who see them will shake their heads in scorn.

19Ps 65:5 You answer us with awesome deeds of righteousness, O God our Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of the farthest seas,
19Ps 65:6 who formed the mountains by your power, having armed yourself with strength,
19Ps 65:7 who stilled the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the turmoil of the nations.
19Ps 65:8 Those living far away fear your wonders; where morning dawns and evening fades you call forth songs of joy.
19Ps 65:9 You care for the land and water it; you enrich it abundantly. The streams of God are filled with water to provide the people with grain, for so you have ordained it.
19Ps 65:10 You drench its furrows and level its ridges; you soften it with showers and bless its crops.
19Ps 65:11 You crown the year with your bounty, and your carts overflow with abundance.

19Ps 66:12 You let men ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, but you brought us to a place of abundance.
19Ps 66:13 I will come to your temple with burnt offerings and fulfill my vows to you--
19Ps 66:14 vows my lips promised and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble.

19Ps 66:17 I cried out to him with my mouth; his praise was on my tongue.

19Ps 68:12 "Kings and armies flee in haste; in the camps men divide the plunder.

19Ps 68:23 that you may plunge your feet in the blood of your foes, while the tongues of your dogs have their share."
19Ps 68:24 Your procession has come into view, O God, the procession of my God and King into the sanctuary.
19Ps 68:25 In front are the singers, after them the musicians; with them are the maidens playing tambourines.
19Ps 68:26 Praise God in the great congregation; praise the LORD in the assembly of Israel.

19Ps 68:29 Because of your temple at Jerusalem kings will bring you gifts.
19Ps 68:30 Rebuke the beast among the reeds, the herd of bulls among the calves of the nations. Humbled, may it bring bars of silver. Scatter the nations who delight in war.

19Ps 68:32 Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth, sing praise to the Lord, Selah
19Ps 68:33 to him who rides the ancient skies above, who thunders with mighty voice.
19Ps 68:34 Proclaim the power of God, whose majesty is over Israel, whose power is in the skies.
19Ps 68:35 You are awesome, O God, in your sanctuary; the God of Israel gives power and strength to his people. Praise be to God!
19Ps 69:1 For the director of music. To the tune of"Lilies." Of David. Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.
19Ps 69:2 I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me.
19Ps 69:3 I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for my God.
19Ps 69:4 Those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head; many are my enemies without cause, those who seek to destroy me. I am forced to restore what I did not steal.
19Ps 69:5 You know my folly, O God; my guilt is not hidden from you.
19Ps 69:6 May those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the LORD Almighty; may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.
19Ps 69:7 For I endure scorn for your sake, and shame covers my face.
19Ps 69:8 I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my own mother's sons;
19Ps 69:9 for zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.
19Ps 69:10 When I weep and fast, I must endure scorn;
19Ps 69:11 when I put on sackcloth, people make sport of me.
19Ps 69:12 Those who sit at the gate mock me, and I am the song of the drunkards.
19Ps 69:13 But I pray to you, O LORD, in the time of your favor; in your great love, O God, answer me with your sure salvation.
19Ps 69:14 Rescue me from the mire, do not let me sink; deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep waters.
19Ps 69:15 Do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me.
19Ps 69:16 Answer me, O LORD, out of the goodness of your love; in your great mercy turn to me.
19Ps 69:17 Do not hide your face from your servant; answer me quickly, for I am in trouble.
19Ps 69:18 Come near and rescue me; redeem me because of my foes.
19Ps 69:19 You know how I am scorned, disgraced and shamed; all my enemies are before you.
19Ps 69:20 Scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless; I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but I found none.
19Ps 69:21 They put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst.
19Ps 69:22 May the table set before them become a snare; may it become retribution and a trap.
19Ps 69:23 May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.
19Ps 69:24 Pour out your wrath on them; let your fierce anger overtake them.
19Ps 69:25 May their place be deserted; let there be no one to dwell in their tents.
19Ps 69:26 For they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt.
19Ps 69:27 Charge them with crime upon crime; do not let them share in your salvation.
19Ps 69:28 May they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous.
19Ps 69:29 I am in pain and distress; may your salvation, O God, protect me.
19Ps 69:30 I will praise God's name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving.
19Ps 69:31 This will please the LORD more than an ox, more than a bull with its horns and hoofs.
19Ps 69:32 The poor will see and be glad--you who seek God, may your hearts live!
19Ps 69:33 The LORD hears the needy and does not despise his captive people.
19Ps 69:34 Let heaven and earth praise him, the seas and all that move in them,
19Ps 69:35 for God will save Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah. Then people will settle there and possess it;
19Ps 69:36 the children of his servants will inherit it, and those who love his name will dwell there.
19Ps 70:1 For the director of music. Of David. A petition. Hasten, O God, to save me; O LORD, come quickly to help me.
19Ps 70:2 May those who seek my life be put to shame and confusion; may all who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
19Ps 70:3 May those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!" turn back because of their shame.
19Ps 70:4 But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation always say, "Let God be exalted!"
19Ps 70:5 Yet I am poor and needy; come quickly to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.
19Ps 71:1 In you, O LORD, I have taken refuge; let me never be put to shame.
19Ps 71:2 Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness; turn your ear to me and save me.
19Ps 71:3 Be my rock of refuge, to which I can always go; give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
19Ps 71:4 Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of evil and cruel men.
19Ps 71:5 For you have been my hope, O Sovereign LORD, my confidence since my youth.
19Ps 71:6 From birth I have relied on you; you brought me forth from my mother's womb. I will ever praise you.
19Ps 71:7 I have become like a portent to many, but you are my strong refuge.
19Ps 71:8 My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long.
19Ps 71:9 Do not cast me away when I am old; do not forsake me when my strength is gone.
19Ps 71:10 For my enemies speak against me; those who wait to kill me conspire together.
19Ps 71:11 They say, "God has forsaken him; pursue him and seize him, for no one will rescue him."
19Ps 71:12 Be not far from me, O God; come quickly, O my God, to help me.
19Ps 71:13 May my accusers perish in shame; may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace.
19Ps 71:14 But as for me, I will always have hope; I will praise you more and more.
19Ps 71:15 My mouth will tell of your righteousness, of your salvation all day long, though I know not its measure.
19Ps 71:16 I will come and proclaim your mighty acts, O Sovereign LORD; I will proclaim your righteousness, yours alone.
19Ps 71:17 Since my youth, O God, you have taught me, and to this day I declare your marvelous deeds.
19Ps 71:18 Even when I am old and gray, do not forsake me, O God, till I declare your power to the next generation, your might to all who are to come.
19Ps 71:19 Your righteousness reaches to the skies, O God, you who have done great things. Who, O God, is like you?
19Ps 71:20 Though you have made me see troubles, many and bitter, you will restore my life again; from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up.
19Ps 71:21 You will increase my honor and comfort me once again.
19Ps 71:22 I will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, O my God; I will sing praise to you with the lyre, O Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 71:23 My lips will shout for joy when I sing praise to you--I, whom you have redeemed.
19Ps 71:24 My tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long, for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion.
19Ps 72:1 Of Solomon. Endow the king with your justice, O God, the royal son with your righteousness.
19Ps 72:2 He will judge your people in righteousness, your afflicted ones with justice.
19Ps 72:3 The mountains will bring prosperity to the people, the hills the fruit of righteousness.
19Ps 72:4 He will defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy; he will crush the oppressor.
19Ps 72:5 He will endure as long as the sun, as long as the moon, through all generations.
19Ps 72:6 He will be like rain falling on a mown field, like showers watering the earth.
19Ps 72:7 In his days the righteous will flourish; prosperity will abound till the moon is no more.
19Ps 72:8 He will rule from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth.
19Ps 72:9 The desert tribes will bow before him and his enemies will lick the dust.
19Ps 72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of distant shores will bring tribute to him; the kings of Sheba and Seba will present him gifts.
19Ps 72:11 All kings will bow down to him and all nations will serve him.
19Ps 72:12 For he will deliver the needy who cry out, the afflicted who have no one to help.
19Ps 72:13 He will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death.
19Ps 72:14 He will rescue them from oppression and violence, for precious is their blood in his sight.
19Ps 72:15 Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him and bless him all day long.
19Ps 72:16 Let grain abound throughout the land; on the tops of the hills may it sway. Let its fruit flourish like Lebanon; let it thrive like the grass of the field.
19Ps 72:17 May his name endure forever; may it continue as long as the sun. All nations will be blessed through him, and they will call him blessed.
19Ps 72:18 Praise be to the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
19Ps 72:19 Praise be to his glorious name forever; may the whole earth be filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.
19Ps 72:20 This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.
19Ps 73:1 A psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart.
19Ps 73:2 But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold.
19Ps 73:3 For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
19Ps 73:4 They have no struggles; their bodies are healthy and strong.
19Ps 73:5 They are free from the burdens common to man; they are not plagued by human ills.
19Ps 73:6 Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence.
19Ps 73:7 From their callous hearts comes iniquity; the evil conceits of their minds know no limits.
19Ps 73:8 They scoff, and speak with malice; in their arrogance they threaten oppression.
19Ps 73:9 Their mouths lay claim to heaven, and their tongues take possession of the earth.
19Ps 73:10 Therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance.
19Ps 73:11 They say, "How can God know? Does the Most High have knowledge?"
19Ps 73:12 This is what the wicked are like--always carefree, they increase in wealth.
19Ps 73:13 Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure; in vain have I washed my hands in innocence.
19Ps 73:14 All day long I have been plagued; I have been punished every morning.
19Ps 73:15 If I had said, "I will speak thus," I would have betrayed your children.
19Ps 73:16 When I tried to understand all this, it was oppressive to me
19Ps 73:17 till I entered the sanctuary of God; then I understood their final destiny.
19Ps 73:18 Surely you place them on slippery ground; you cast them down to ruin.
19Ps 73:19 How suddenly are they destroyed, completely swept away by terrors!
19Ps 73:20 As a dream when one awakes, so when you arise, O Lord, you will despise them as fantasies.
19Ps 73:21 When my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered,
19Ps 73:22 I was senseless and ignorant; I was a brute beast before you.
19Ps 73:23 Yet I am always with you; you hold me by my right hand.
19Ps 73:24 You guide me with your counsel, and afterward you will take me into glory.
19Ps 73:25 Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you.
19Ps 73:26 My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
19Ps 73:27 Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
19Ps 73:28 But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign LORD my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds.
19Ps 74:1 A maskil of Asaph. Why have you rejected us forever, O God? Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
19Ps 74:2 Remember the people you purchased of old, the tribe of your inheritance, whom you redeemed--Mount Zion, where you dwelt.
19Ps 74:3 Turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins, all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary.
19Ps 74:4 Your foes roared in the place where you met with us; they set up their standards as signs.
19Ps 74:5 They behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees.
19Ps 74:6 They smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets.
19Ps 74:7 They burned your sanctuary to the ground; they defiled the dwelling place of your Name.
19Ps 74:8 They said in their hearts, "We will crush them completely!" They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.
19Ps 74:9 We are given no miraculous signs; no prophets are left, and none of us knows how long this will be.
19Ps 74:10 How long will the enemy mock you, O God? Will the foe revile your name forever?
19Ps 74:11 Why do you hold back your hand, your right hand? Take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them!
19Ps 74:12 But you, O God, are my king from of old; you bring salvation upon the earth.
19Ps 74:13 It was you who split open the sea by your power; you broke the heads of the monster in the waters.
19Ps 74:14 It was you who crushed the heads of Leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert.
19Ps 74:15 It was you who opened up springs and streams; you dried up the ever flowing rivers.
19Ps 74:16 The day is yours, and yours also the night; you established the sun and moon.
19Ps 74:17 It was you who set all the boundaries of the earth; you made both summer and winter.
19Ps 74:18 Remember how the enemy has mocked you, O LORD, how foolish people have reviled your name.
19Ps 74:19 Do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts; do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever.
19Ps 74:20 Have regard for your covenant, because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land.
19Ps 74:21 Do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace; may the poor and needy praise your name.
19Ps 74:22 Rise up, O God, and defend your cause; remember how fools mock you all day long.
19Ps 74:23 Do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries, the uproar of your enemies, which rises continually.
19Ps 75:1 For the director of music. To the tune of"Do Not Destroy." A psalm of Asaph. A song. We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks, for your Name is near; men tell of your wonderful deeds.
19Ps 75:2 You say, "I choose the appointed time; it is I who judge uprightly.
19Ps 75:3 When the earth and all its people quake, it is I who hold its pillars firm. Selah
19Ps 75:4 To the arrogant I say, 'Boast no more,' and to the wicked, 'Do not lift up your horns.
19Ps 75:5 Do not lift your horns against heaven; do not speak with outstretched neck.'"
19Ps 75:6 No one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt a man.
19Ps 75:7 But it is God who judges£º He brings one down, he exalts another.
19Ps 75:8 In the hand of the LORD is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices; he pours it out, and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs.
19Ps 75:9 As for me, I will declare this forever; I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
19Ps 75:10 I will cut off the horns of all the wicked, but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
19Ps 76:1 For the director of music. With stringed instruments. A psalm of Asaph. A song. In Judah God is known; his name is great in Israel.
19Ps 76:2 His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion.
19Ps 76:3 There he broke the flashing arrows, the shields and the swords, the weapons of war. Selah
19Ps 76:4 You are resplendent with light, more majestic than mountains rich with game.
19Ps 76:5 Valiant men lie plundered, they sleep their last sleep; not one of the warriors can lift his hands.
19Ps 76:6 At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and chariot lie still.
19Ps 76:7 You alone are to be feared. Who can stand before you when you are angry?
19Ps 76:8 From heaven you pronounced judgment, and the land feared and was quiet--
19Ps 76:9 when you, O God, rose up to judge, to save all the afflicted of the land. Selah
19Ps 76:10 Surely your wrath against men brings you praise, and the survivors of your wrath are restrained.
19Ps 76:11 Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill them; let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the One to be feared.
19Ps 76:12 He breaks the spirit of rulers; he is feared by the kings of the earth.
19Ps 77:1 For the director of music. For Jeduthun. Of Asaph. A psalm. I cried out to God for help; I cried out to God to hear me.
19Ps 77:2 When I was in distress, I sought the Lord; at night I stretched out untiring hands and my soul refused to be comforted.
19Ps 77:3 I remembered you, O God, and I groaned; I mused, and my spirit grew faint. Selah
19Ps 77:4 You kept my eyes from closing; I was too troubled to speak.
19Ps 77:5 I thought about the former days, the years of long ago;
19Ps 77:6 I remembered my songs in the night. My heart mused and my spirit inquired£º
19Ps 77:7 "Will the Lord reject forever? Will he never show his favor again?
19Ps 77:8 Has his unfailing love vanished forever? Has his promise failed for all time?
19Ps 77:9 Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has he in anger withheld his compassion?" Selah
19Ps 77:10 Then I thought, "To this I will appeal£º the years of the right hand of the Most High."
19Ps 77:11 I will remember the deeds of the LORD; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.
19Ps 77:12 I will meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds.
19Ps 77:13 Your ways, O God, are holy. What god is so great as our God?
19Ps 77:14 You are the God who performs miracles; you display your power among the peoples.
19Ps 77:15 With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
19Ps 77:16 The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and writhed; the very depths were convulsed.
19Ps 77:17 The clouds poured down water, the skies resounded with thunder; your arrows flashed back and forth.
19Ps 77:18 Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, your lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.
19Ps 77:19 Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though your footprints were not seen.
19Ps 77:20 You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
19Ps 78:1 A maskil of Asaph. O my people, hear my teaching; listen to the words of my mouth.
19Ps 78:2 I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter hidden things, things from of old--
19Ps 78:3 what we have heard and known, what our fathers have told us.
19Ps 78:4 We will not hide them from their children; we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.
19Ps 78:5 He decreed statutes for Jacob and established the law in Israel, which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,
19Ps 78:6 so the next generation would know them, even the children yet to be born, and they in turn would tell their children.
19Ps 78:7 Then they would put their trust in God and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands.
19Ps 78:8 They would not be like their forefathers--a stubborn and rebellious generation, whose hearts were not loyal to God, whose spirits were not faithful to him.
19Ps 78:9 The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned back on the day of battle;
19Ps 78:10 they did not keep God's covenant and refused to live by his law.
19Ps 78:11 They forgot what he had done, the wonders he had shown them.
19Ps 78:12 He did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
19Ps 78:13 He divided the sea and led them through; he made the water stand firm like a wall.
19Ps 78:14 He guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night.
19Ps 78:15 He split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas;
19Ps 78:16 he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers.
19Ps 78:17 But they continued to sin against him, rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
19Ps 78:18 They willfully put God to the test by demanding the food they craved.
19Ps 78:19 They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert?
19Ps 78:20 When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?"
19Ps 78:21 When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel,
19Ps 78:22 for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance.
19Ps 78:23 Yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens;
19Ps 78:24 he rained down manna for the people to eat, he gave them the grain of heaven.
19Ps 78:25 Men ate the bread of angels; he sent them all the food they could eat.
19Ps 78:26 He let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power.
19Ps 78:27 He rained meat down on them like dust, flying birds like sand on the seashore.
19Ps 78:28 He made them come down inside their camp, all around their tents.
19Ps 78:29 They ate till they had more than enough, for he had given them what they craved.
19Ps 78:30 But before they turned from the food they craved, even while it was still in their mouths,
19Ps 78:31 God's anger rose against them; he put to death the sturdiest among them, cutting down the young men of Israel.
19Ps 78:32 In spite of all this, they kept on sinning; in spite of his wonders, they did not believe.
19Ps 78:33 So he ended their days in futility and their years in terror.
19Ps 78:34 Whenever God slew them, they would seek him; they eagerly turned to him again.
19Ps 78:35 They remembered that God was their Rock, that God Most High was their Redeemer.
19Ps 78:36 But then they would flatter him with their mouths, lying to him with their tongues;
19Ps 78:37 their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.
19Ps 78:38 Yet he was merciful; he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them. Time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath.
19Ps 78:39 He remembered that they were but flesh, a passing breeze that does not return.
19Ps 78:40 How often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland!
19Ps 78:41 Again and again they put God to the test; they vexed the Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 78:42 They did not remember his power--the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,
19Ps 78:43 the day he displayed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the region of Zoan.
19Ps 78:44 He turned their rivers to blood; they could not drink from their streams.
19Ps 78:45 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them, and frogs that devastated them.
19Ps 78:46 He gave their crops to the grasshopper, their produce to the locust.
19Ps 78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore-figs with sleet.
19Ps 78:48 He gave over their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.
19Ps 78:49 He unleashed against them his hot anger, his wrath, indignation and hostility--a band of destroying angels.
19Ps 78:50 He prepared a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague.
19Ps 78:51 He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt, the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.
19Ps 78:52 But he brought his people out like a flock; he led them like sheep through the desert.
19Ps 78:53 He guided them safely, so they were unafraid; but the sea engulfed their enemies.
19Ps 78:54 Thus he brought them to the border of his holy land, to the hill country his right hand had taken.
19Ps 78:55 He drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance; he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.
19Ps 78:56 But they put God to the test and rebelled against the Most High; they did not keep his statutes.
19Ps 78:57 Like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless, as unreliable as a faulty bow.
19Ps 78:58 They angered him with their high places; they aroused his jealousy with their idols.
19Ps 78:59 When God heard them, he was very angry; he rejected Israel completely.
19Ps 78:60 He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent he had set up among men.
19Ps 78:61 He sent the ark of his might into captivity, his splendor into the hands of the enemy.
19Ps 78:62 He gave his people over to the sword; he was very angry with his inheritance.
19Ps 78:63 Fire consumed their young men, and their maidens had no wedding songs;

19Ps 94:4 They pour out arrogant words; all the evildoers are full of boasting.
19Ps 94:5 They crush your people, O LORD; they oppress your inheritance.
19Ps 94:6 They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.
19Ps 94:7 They say, "The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed."
19Ps 94:8 Take heed, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise?
19Ps 94:9 Does he who implanted the ear not hear? Does he who formed the eye not see?
19Ps 94:10 Does he who disciplines nations not punish? Does he who teaches man lack knowledge?
19Ps 94:11 The LORD knows the thoughts of man; he knows that they are futile.
19Ps 94:12 Blessed is the man you discipline, O LORD, the man you teach from your law;
19Ps 94:13 you grant him relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.
19Ps 94:14 For the LORD will not reject his people; he will never forsake his inheritance.
19Ps 94:15 Judgment will again be founded on righteousness, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
19Ps 94:16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will take a stand for me against evildoers?
19Ps 94:17 Unless the LORD had given me help, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death.
19Ps 94:18 When I said, "My foot is slipping," your love, O LORD, supported me.
19Ps 94:19 When anxiety was great within me, your consolation brought joy to my soul.
19Ps 94:20 Can a corrupt throne be allied with you--one that brings on misery by its decrees?
19Ps 94:21 They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
19Ps 94:22 But the LORD has become my fortress, and my God the rock in whom I take refuge.
19Ps 94:23 He will repay them for their sins and destroy them for their wickedness; the LORD our God will destroy them.
19Ps 95:1 Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout aloud to the Rock of our salvation.
19Ps 95:2 Let us come before him with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.
19Ps 95:3 For the LORD is the great God, the great King above all gods.
19Ps 95:4 In his hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to him.
19Ps 95:5 The sea is his, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land.
19Ps 95:6 Come, let us bow down in worship, let us kneel before the LORD our Maker;
19Ps 95:7 for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture, the flock under his care. Today, if you hear his voice,
19Ps 95:8 do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, as you did that day at Massah in the desert,
19Ps 95:9 where your fathers tested and tried me, though they had seen what I did.
19Ps 95:10 For forty years I was angry with that generation; I said, "They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known my ways."
19Ps 95:11 So I declared on oath in my anger, "They shall never enter my rest."
19Ps 96:1 Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth.
19Ps 96:2 Sing to the LORD, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day.

19Ps 96:4 For great is the LORD and most worthy of praise; he is to be feared above all gods.
19Ps 96:5 For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the LORD made the heavens.

19Ps 96:12 let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy;
19Ps 96:13 they will sing before the LORD, for he comes, he comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in his truth.
19Ps 97:1 The LORD reigns, let the earth be glad; let the distant shores rejoice.
19Ps 97:2 Clouds and thick darkness surround him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
19Ps 97:3 Fire goes before him and consumes his foes on every side.
19Ps 97:4 His lightning lights up the world; the earth sees and trembles.
19Ps 97:5 The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.
19Ps 97:6 The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory.
19Ps 97:7 All who worship images are put to shame, those who boast in idols--worship him, all you gods!
19Ps 97:8 Zion hears and rejoices and the villages of Judah are glad because of your judgments, O LORD.
19Ps 97:9 For you, O LORD, are the Most High over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods.
19Ps 97:10 Let those who love the LORD hate evil, for he guards the lives of his faithful ones and delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
19Ps 97:11 Light is shed upon the righteous and joy on the upright in heart.
19Ps 97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, you who are righteous, and praise his holy name.
19Ps 98:1 A psalm. Sing to the LORD a new song, for he has done marvelous things; his right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
19Ps 98:2 The LORD has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the nations.
19Ps 98:3 He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
19Ps 98:4 Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth, burst into jubilant song with music;
19Ps 98:5 make music to the LORD with the harp, with the harp and the sound of singing,
19Ps 98:6 with trumpets and the blast of the ram's horn--shout for joy before the LORD, the King.
19Ps 98:7 Let the sea resound, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it.

19Ps 99:5 Exalt the LORD our God and worship at his footstool; he is holy.
19Ps 99:6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel was among those who called on his name; they called on the LORD and he answered them.
19Ps 99:7 He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept his statutes and the decrees he gave them.
19Ps 99:8 O LORD our God, you answered them; you were to Israel a forgiving God, though you punished their misdeeds.

19Ps 101:3 I will set before my eyes no vile thing. The deeds of faithless men I hate; they will not cling to me.
19Ps 101:4 Men of perverse heart shall be far from me; I will have nothing to do with evil.
19Ps 101:5 Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I put to silence; whoever has haughty eyes and a proud heart, him will I not endure.

19Ps 101:7 No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence.
19Ps 101:8 Every morning I will put to silence all the wicked in the land; I will cut off every evildoer from the city of the LORD.
19Ps 102:1 A prayer of an afflicted man. When he is faint and pours out his lament before the LORD. Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry for help come to you.
19Ps 102:2 Do not hide your face from me when I am in distress. Turn your ear to me; when I call, answer me quickly.
19Ps 102:3 For my days vanish like smoke; my bones burn like glowing embers.
19Ps 102:4 My heart is blighted and withered like grass; I forget to eat my food.
19Ps 102:5 Because of my loud groaning I am reduced to skin and bones.
19Ps 102:6 I am like a desert owl, like an owl among the ruins.
19Ps 102:7 I lie awake; I have become like a bird alone on a roof.
19Ps 102:8 All day long my enemies taunt me; those who rail against me use my name as a curse.
19Ps 102:9 For I eat ashes as my food and mingle my drink with tears
19Ps 102:10 because of your great wrath, for you have taken me up and thrown me aside.
19Ps 102:11 My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass.
19Ps 102:12 But you, O LORD, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through all generations.
19Ps 102:13 You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to her; the appointed time has come.
19Ps 102:14 For her stones are dear to your servants; her very dust moves them to pity.
19Ps 102:15 The nations will fear the name of the LORD, all the kings of the earth will revere your glory.
19Ps 102:16 For the LORD will rebuild Zion and appear in his glory.
19Ps 102:17 He will respond to the prayer of the destitute; he will not despise their plea.
19Ps 102:18 Let this be written for a future generation, that a people not yet created may praise the LORD£º
19Ps 102:19 "The LORD looked down from his sanctuary on high, from heaven he viewed the earth,
19Ps 102:20 to hear the groans of the prisoners and release those condemned to death."
19Ps 102:21 So the name of the LORD will be declared in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem
19Ps 102:22 when the peoples and the kingdoms assemble to worship the LORD.
19Ps 102:23 In the course of my life he broke my strength; he cut short my days.
19Ps 102:24 So I said£º "Do not take me away, O my God, in the midst of my days; your years go on through all generations.
19Ps 102:25 In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
19Ps 102:26 They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them and they will be discarded.
19Ps 102:27 But you remain the same, and your years will never end.
19Ps 102:28 The children of your servants will live in your presence; their descendants will be established before you."
19Ps 103:1 Of David. Praise the LORD, O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name.
19Ps 103:2 Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits--
19Ps 103:3 who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases,
19Ps 103:4 who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion,
19Ps 103:5 who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
19Ps 103:6 The LORD works righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
19Ps 103:7 He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the people of Israel£º
19Ps 103:8 The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love.
19Ps 103:9 He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever;
19Ps 103:10 he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities.
19Ps 103:11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him;
19Ps 103:12 as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
19Ps 103:13 As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him;
19Ps 103:14 for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust.
19Ps 103:15 As for man, his days are like grass, he flourishes like a flower of the field;
19Ps 103:16 the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.
19Ps 103:17 But from everlasting to everlasting the LORD'S love is with those who fear him, and his righteousness with their children's children--
19Ps 103:18 with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts.
19Ps 103:19 The LORD has established his throne in heaven, and his kingdom rules over all.
19Ps 103:20 Praise the LORD, you his angels, you mighty ones who do his bidding, who obey his word.
19Ps 103:21 Praise the LORD, all his heavenly hosts, you his servants who do his will.
19Ps 103:22 Praise the LORD, all his works everywhere in his dominion. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
19Ps 104:1 Praise the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, you are very great; you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
19Ps 104:2 He wraps himself in light as with a garment; he stretches out the heavens like a tent
19Ps 104:3 and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters. He makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind.
19Ps 104:4 He makes winds his messengers, flames of fire his servants.
19Ps 104:5 He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.
19Ps 104:6 You covered it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
19Ps 104:7 But at your rebuke the waters fled, at the sound of your thunder they took to flight;
19Ps 104:8 they flowed over the mountains, they went down into the valleys, to the place you assigned for them.
19Ps 104:9 You set a boundary they cannot cross; never again will they cover the earth.
19Ps 104:10 He makes springs pour water into the ravines; it flows between the mountains.
19Ps 104:11 They give water to all the beasts of the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
19Ps 104:12 The birds of the air nest by the waters; they sing among the branches.
19Ps 104:13 He waters the mountains from his upper chambers; the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work.
19Ps 104:14 He makes grass grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate--bringing forth food from the earth£º
19Ps 104:15 wine that gladdens the heart of man, oil to make his face shine, and bread that sustains his heart.
19Ps 104:16 The trees of the LORD are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
19Ps 104:17 There the birds make their nests; the stork has its home in the pine trees.
19Ps 104:18 The high mountains belong to the wild goats; the crags are a refuge for the coneys.
19Ps 104:19 The moon marks off the seasons, and the sun knows when to go down.
19Ps 104:20 You bring darkness, it becomes night, and all the beasts of the forest prowl.
19Ps 104:21 The lions roar for their prey and seek their food from God.
19Ps 104:22 The sun rises, and they steal away; they return and lie down in their dens.
19Ps 104:23 Then man goes out to his work, to his labor until evening.
19Ps 104:24 How many are your works, O LORD! In wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
19Ps 104:25 There is the sea, vast and spacious, teeming with creatures beyond number--living things both large and small.
19Ps 104:26 There the ships go to and fro, and the leviathan, which you formed to frolic there.
19Ps 104:27 These all look to you to give them their food at the proper time.
19Ps 104:28 When you give it to them, they gather it up; when you open your hand, they are satisfied with good things.
19Ps 104:29 When you hide your face, they are terrified; when you take away their breath, they die and return to the dust.
19Ps 104:30 When you send your Spirit, they are created, and you renew the face of the earth.
19Ps 104:31 May the glory of the LORD endure forever; may the LORD rejoice in his works--
19Ps 104:32 he who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.
19Ps 104:33 I will sing to the LORD all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.
19Ps 104:34 May my meditation be pleasing to him, as I rejoice in the LORD.
19Ps 104:35 But may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more. Praise the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD.
19Ps 105:1 Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done.
19Ps 105:2 Sing to him, sing praise to him; tell of all his wonderful acts.
19Ps 105:3 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice.
19Ps 105:4 Look to the LORD and his strength; seek his face always.
19Ps 105:5 Remember the wonders he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he pronounced,
19Ps 105:6 O descendants of Abraham his servant, O sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
19Ps 105:7 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
19Ps 105:8 He remembers his covenant forever, the word he commanded, for a thousand generations,
19Ps 105:9 the covenant he made with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.
19Ps 105:10 He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant£º
19Ps 105:11 "To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion you will inherit."
19Ps 105:12 When they were but few in number, few indeed, and strangers in it,
19Ps 105:13 they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
19Ps 105:14 He allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he rebuked kings£º
19Ps 105:15 "Do not touch my anointed ones; do my prophets no harm."
19Ps 105:16 He called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food;
19Ps 105:17 and he sent a man before them--Joseph, sold as a slave.
19Ps 105:18 They bruised his feet with shackles, his neck was put in irons,
19Ps 105:19 till what he foretold came to pass, till the word of the LORD proved him true.
19Ps 105:20 The king sent and released him, the ruler of peoples set him free.
19Ps 105:21 He made him master of his household, ruler over all he possessed,
19Ps 105:22 to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom.
19Ps 105:23 Then Israel entered Egypt; Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:24 The LORD made his people very fruitful; he made them too numerous for their foes,
19Ps 105:25 whose hearts he turned to hate his people, to conspire against his servants.
19Ps 105:26 He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
19Ps 105:27 They performed his miraculous signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:28 He sent darkness and made the land dark--for had they not rebelled against his words?
19Ps 105:29 He turned their waters into blood, causing their fish to die.
19Ps 105:30 Their land teemed with frogs, which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers.
19Ps 105:31 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country.
19Ps 105:32 He turned their rain into hail, with lightning throughout their land;
19Ps 105:33 he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country.
19Ps 105:34 He spoke, and the locusts came, grasshoppers without number;
19Ps 105:35 they ate up every green thing in their land, ate up the produce of their soil.
19Ps 105:36 Then he struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their manhood.
19Ps 105:37 He brought out Israel, laden with silver and gold, and from among their tribes no one faltered.
19Ps 105:38 Egypt was glad when they left, because dread of Israel had fallen on them.
19Ps 105:39 He spread out a cloud as a covering, and a fire to give light at night.
19Ps 105:40 They asked, and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
19Ps 105:41 He opened the rock, and water gushed out; like a river it flowed in the desert.
19Ps 105:42 For he remembered his holy promise given to his servant Abraham.
19Ps 105:43 He brought out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy;
19Ps 105:44 he gave them the lands of the nations, and they fell heir to what others had toiled for--
19Ps 105:45 that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws. Praise the LORD.
19Ps 106:1 Praise the LORD. Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever.
19Ps 106:2 Who can proclaim the mighty acts of the LORD or fully declare his praise?
19Ps 106:3 Blessed are they who maintain justice, who constantly do what is right.
19Ps 106:4 Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people, come to my aid when you save them,
19Ps 106:5 that I may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones, that I may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise.
19Ps 106:6 We have sinned, even as our fathers did; we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
19Ps 106:7 When our fathers were in Egypt, they gave no thought to your miracles; they did not remember your many kindnesses, and they rebelled by the sea, the Red Sea.
19Ps 106:8 Yet he saved them for his name's sake, to make his mighty power known.
19Ps 106:9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led them through the depths as through a desert.
19Ps 106:10 He saved them from the hand of the foe; from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them.
19Ps 106:11 The waters covered their adversaries; not one of them survived.
19Ps 106:12 Then they believed his promises and sang his praise.
19Ps 106:13 But they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel.
19Ps 106:14 In the desert they gave in to their craving; in the wasteland they put God to the test.
19Ps 106:15 So he gave them what they asked for, but sent a wasting disease upon them.
19Ps 106:16 In the camp they grew envious of Moses and of Aaron, who was consecrated to the LORD.
19Ps 106:17 The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it buried the company of Abiram.
19Ps 106:18 Fire blazed among their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.
19Ps 106:19 At Horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal.
19Ps 106:20 They exchanged their Glory for an image of a bull, which eats grass.
19Ps 106:21 They forgot the God who saved them, who had done great things in Egypt,
19Ps 106:22 miracles in the land of Ham and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
19Ps 106:23 So he said he would destroy them--had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them.
19Ps 106:24 Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promise.
19Ps 106:25 They grumbled in their tents and did not obey the LORD.
19Ps 106:26 So he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert,
19Ps 106:27 make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands.
19Ps 106:28 They yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods;
19Ps 106:29 they provoked the LORD to anger by their wicked deeds, and a plague broke out among them.
19Ps 106:30 But Phinehas stood up and intervened, and the plague was checked.
19Ps 106:31 This was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come.
19Ps 106:32 By the waters of Meribah they angered the LORD, and trouble came to Moses because of them;
19Ps 106:33 for they rebelled against the Spirit of God, and rash words came from Moses' lips.
19Ps 106:34 They did not destroy the peoples as the LORD had commanded them,
19Ps 106:35 but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs.
19Ps 106:36 They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
19Ps 106:37 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
19Ps 106:38 They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, and the land was desecrated by their blood.
19Ps 106:39 They defiled themselves by what they did; by their deeds they prostituted themselves.
19Ps 106:40 Therefore the LORD was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance.
19Ps 106:41 He handed them over to the nations, and their foes ruled over them.
19Ps 106:42 Their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power.
19Ps 106:43 Many times he delivered them, but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin.
19Ps 106:44 But he took note of their distress when he heard their cry;

19Ps 139:4 Before a word is on my tongue you know it completely, O LORD.
19Ps 139:5 You hem me in--behind and before; you have laid your hand upon me.
19Ps 139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, too lofty for me to attain.

19Ps 139:11 If I say, "Surely the darkness will hide me and the light become night around me,"

19Ps 139:13 For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.
19Ps 139:14 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.
19Ps 139:15 My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place. When I was woven together in the depths of the earth,
19Ps 139:16 your eyes saw my unformed body. All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.
19Ps 139:17 How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them!
19Ps 139:18 Were I to count them, they would outnumber the grains of sand. When I awake, I am still with you.
19Ps 139:19 If only you would slay the wicked, O God! Away from me, you bloodthirsty men!
19Ps 139:20 They speak of you with evil intent; your adversaries misuse your name.
19Ps 139:21 Do I not hate those who hate you, O LORD, and abhor those who rise up against you?

19Ps 141:3 Set a guard over my mouth, O LORD; keep watch over the door of my lips.
19Ps 141:4 Let not my heart be drawn to what is evil, to take part in wicked deeds with men who are evildoers; let me not eat of their delicacies.
19Ps 141:5 Let a righteous man strike me--it is a kindness; let him rebuke me--it is oil on my head. My head will not refuse it. Yet my prayer is ever against the deeds of evildoers;
19Ps 141:6 their rulers will be thrown down from the cliffs, and the wicked will learn that my words were well spoken.
19Ps 141:7 They will say,"As one plows and breaks up the earth, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of the grave."
19Ps 141:8 But my eyes are fixed on you, O Sovereign LORD; in you I take refuge--do not give me over to death.

19Ps 141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.
19Ps 142:1 A maskil of David. When he was in the cave. A prayer. I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy.
19Ps 142:2 I pour out my complaint before him; before him I tell my trouble.

19Ps 142:5 I cry to you, O LORD; I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the land of the living."
19Ps 142:6 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need; rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me.
19Ps 142:7 Set me free from my prison, that I may praise your name. Then the righteous will gather about me because of your goodness to me.

19Ps 143:3 The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in darkness like those long dead.
19Ps 143:4 So my spirit grows faint within me; my heart within me is dismayed.
19Ps 143:5 I remember the days of long ago; I meditate on all your works and consider what your hands have done.
19Ps 143:6 I spread out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land. Selah

19Ps 144:2 He is my loving God and my fortress, my stronghold and my deliverer, my shield, in whom I take refuge, who subdues peoples under me.
19Ps 144:3 O LORD, what is man that you care for him, the son of man that you think of him?
19Ps 144:4 Man is like a breath; his days are like a fleeting shadow.
19Ps 144:5 Part your heavens, O LORD, and come down; touch the mountains, so that they smoke.
19Ps 144:6 Send forth lightning and scatter the enemies; shoot your arrows and rout them.
19Ps 144:7 Reach down your hand from on high; deliver me and rescue me from the mighty waters, from the hands of foreigners
19Ps 144:8 whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.
19Ps 144:9 I will sing a new song to you, O God; on the ten-stringed lyre I will make music to you,
19Ps 144:10 to the One who gives victory to kings, who delivers his servant David from the deadly sword.
19Ps 144:11 Deliver me and rescue me from the hands of foreigners whose mouths are full of lies, whose right hands are deceitful.
19Ps 144:12 Then our sons in their youth will be like well-nurtured plants, and our daughters will be like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
19Ps 144:13 Our barns will be filled with every kind of provision. Our sheep will increase by thousands, by tens of thousands in our fields;
19Ps 144:14 our oxen will draw heavy loads. There will be no breaching of walls, no going into captivity, no cry of distress in our streets.

19Ps 146:4 When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing.
19Ps 146:5 Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God,

20Pr 1:1 The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel£º
20Pr 1:2 for attaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight;
20Pr 1:3 for acquiring a disciplined and prudent life, doing what is right and just and fair;
20Pr 1:4 for giving prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young--
20Pr 1:5 let the wise listen and add to their learning, and let the discerning get guidance--
20Pr 1:6 for understanding proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.
20Pr 1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
20Pr 1:8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction and do not forsake your mother's teaching.
20Pr 1:9 They will be a garland to grace your head and a chain to adorn your neck.
20Pr 1:10 My son, if sinners entice you, do not give in to them.
20Pr 1:11 If they say, "Come along with us; let's lie in wait for someone's blood, let's waylay some harmless soul;
20Pr 1:12 let's swallow them alive, like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;
20Pr 1:13 we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder;
20Pr 1:14 throw in your lot with us, and we will share a common purse"--
20Pr 1:15 my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;
20Pr 1:16 for their feet rush into sin, they are swift to shed blood.
20Pr 1:17 How useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds!
20Pr 1:18 These men lie in wait for their own blood; they waylay only themselves!
20Pr 1:19 Such is the end of all who go after ill-gotten gain; it takes away the lives of those who get it.
20Pr 1:20 Wisdom calls aloud in the street, she raises her voice in the public squares;
20Pr 1:21 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out, in the gateways of the city she makes her speech£º
20Pr 1:22 "How long will you simple ones love your simple ways? How long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge?
20Pr 1:23 If you had responded to my rebuke, I would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you.
20Pr 1:24 But since you rejected me when I called and no one gave heed when I stretched out my hand,
20Pr 1:25 since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke,
20Pr 1:26 I in turn will laugh at your disaster; I will mock when calamity overtakes you--
20Pr 1:27 when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind, when distress and trouble overwhelm you.
20Pr 1:28 "Then they will call to me but I will not answer; they will look for me but will not find me.
20Pr 1:29 Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD,
20Pr 1:30 since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,
20Pr 1:31 they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.
20Pr 1:32 For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;
20Pr 1:33 but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease, without fear of harm."
20Pr 2:1 My son, if you accept my words and store up my commands within you,
20Pr 2:2 turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding,
20Pr 2:3 and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding,
20Pr 2:4 and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,
20Pr 2:5 then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.
20Pr 2:6 For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
20Pr 2:7 He holds victory in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,
20Pr 2:8 for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones.
20Pr 2:9 Then you will understand what is right and just and fair--every good path.
20Pr 2:10 For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
20Pr 2:11 Discretion will protect you, and understanding will guard you.
20Pr 2:12 Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse,
20Pr 2:13 who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways,
20Pr 2:14 who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil,
20Pr 2:15 whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.
20Pr 2:16 It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words,
20Pr 2:17 who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.
20Pr 2:18 For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.
20Pr 2:19 None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.
20Pr 2:20 Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous.
20Pr 2:21 For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;
20Pr 2:22 but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it.
20Pr 3:1 My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart,
20Pr 3:2 for they will prolong your life many years and bring you prosperity.
20Pr 3:3 Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Pr 3:4 Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.
20Pr 3:5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;
20Pr 3:6 in all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.
20Pr 3:7 Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and shun evil.
20Pr 3:8 This will bring health to your body and nourishment to your bones.
20Pr 3:9 Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops;
20Pr 3:10 then your barns will be filled to overflowing, and your vats will brim over with new wine.
20Pr 3:11 My son, do not despise the LORD'S discipline and do not resent his rebuke,
20Pr 3:12 because the LORD disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in.
20Pr 3:13 Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gains understanding,
20Pr 3:14 for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold.
20Pr 3:15 She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.
20Pr 3:16 Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.
20Pr 3:17 Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peace.
20Pr 3:18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who lay hold of her will be blessed.
20Pr 3:19 By wisdom the LORD laid the earth's foundations, by understanding he set the heavens in place;
20Pr 3:20 by his knowledge the deeps were divided, and the clouds let drop the dew.
20Pr 3:21 My son, preserve sound judgment and discernment, do not let them out of your sight;
20Pr 3:22 they will be life for you, an ornament to grace your neck.
20Pr 3:23 Then you will go on your way in safety, and your foot will not stumble;
20Pr 3:24 when you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.
20Pr 3:25 Have no fear of sudden disaster or of the ruin that overtakes the wicked,
20Pr 3:26 for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being snared.
20Pr 3:27 Do not withhold good from those who deserve it, when it is in your power to act.
20Pr 3:28 Do not say to your neighbor, "Come back later; I'll give it tomorrow"--when you now have it with you.
20Pr 3:29 Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who lives trustfully near you.
20Pr 3:30 Do not accuse a man for no reason--when he has done you no harm.
20Pr 3:31 Do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways,
20Pr 3:32 for the LORD detests a perverse man but takes the upright into his confidence.
20Pr 3:33 The LORD'S curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the righteous.
20Pr 3:34 He mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble.
20Pr 3:35 The wise inherit honor, but fools he holds up to shame.
20Pr 4:1 Listen, my sons, to a father's instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.
20Pr 4:2 I give you sound learning, so do not forsake my teaching.
20Pr 4:3 When I was a boy in my father's house, still tender, and an only child of my mother,
20Pr 4:4 he taught me and said, "Lay hold of my words with all your heart; keep my commands and you will live.
20Pr 4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or swerve from them.
20Pr 4:6 Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will watch over you.
20Pr 4:7 Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding.
20Pr 4:8 Esteem her, and she will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you.
20Pr 4:9 She will set a garland of grace on your head and present you with a crown of splendor."
20Pr 4:10 Listen, my son, accept what I say, and the years of your life will be many.
20Pr 4:11 I guide you in the way of wisdom and lead you along straight paths.
20Pr 4:12 When you walk, your steps will not be hampered; when you run, you will not stumble.
20Pr 4:13 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; guard it well, for it is your life.
20Pr 4:14 Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evil men.
20Pr 4:15 Avoid it, do not travel on it; turn from it and go on your way.
20Pr 4:16 For they cannot sleep till they do evil; they are robbed of slumber till they make someone fall.
20Pr 4:17 They eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.
20Pr 4:18 The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.
20Pr 4:19 But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what makes them stumble.
20Pr 4:20 My son, pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words.
20Pr 4:21 Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;
20Pr 4:22 for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body.
20Pr 4:23 Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.
20Pr 4:24 Put away perversity from your mouth; keep corrupt talk far from your lips.
20Pr 4:25 Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you.
20Pr 4:26 Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm.
20Pr 4:27 Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.
20Pr 5:1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen well to my words of insight,
20Pr 5:2 that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.
20Pr 5:3 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;
20Pr 5:4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.
20Pr 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.
20Pr 5:6 She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she knows it not.
20Pr 5:7 Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say.
20Pr 5:8 Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house,
20Pr 5:9 lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who is cruel,
20Pr 5:10 lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another man's house.
20Pr 5:11 At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.
20Pr 5:12 You will say, "How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction!
20Pr 5:13 I would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors.
20Pr 5:14 I have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly."
20Pr 5:15 Drink water from your own cistern, running water from your own well.
20Pr 5:16 Should your springs overflow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?
20Pr 5:17 Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.
20Pr 5:18 May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth.
20Pr 5:19 A loving doe, a graceful deer--may her breasts satisfy you always, may you ever be captivated by her love.
20Pr 5:20 Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another man's wife?
20Pr 5:21 For a man's ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths.
20Pr 5:22 The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold him fast.
20Pr 5:23 He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.
20Pr 6:1 My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge for another,
20Pr 6:2 if you have been trapped by what you said, ensnared by the words of your mouth,
20Pr 6:3 then do this, my son, to free yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbor's hands£º Go and humble yourself; press your plea with your neighbor!
20Pr 6:4 Allow no sleep to your eyes, no slumber to your eyelids.
20Pr 6:5 Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.
20Pr 6:6 Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider its ways and be wise!
20Pr 6:7 It has no commander, no overseer or ruler,
20Pr 6:8 yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest.
20Pr 6:9 How long will you lie there, you sluggard? When will you get up from your sleep?
20Pr 6:10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest--
20Pr 6:11 and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.
20Pr 6:12 A scoundrel and villain, who goes about with a corrupt mouth,
20Pr 6:13 who winks with his eye, signals with his feet and motions with his fingers,
20Pr 6:14 who plots evil with deceit in his heart--he always stirs up dissension.
20Pr 6:15 Therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant; he will suddenly be destroyed--without remedy.
20Pr 6:16 There are six things the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to him£º
20Pr 6:17 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,
20Pr 6:18 a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil,
20Pr 6:19 a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.
20Pr 6:20 My son, keep your father's commands and do not forsake your mother's teaching.
20Pr 6:21 Bind them upon your heart forever; fasten them around your neck.
20Pr 6:22 When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.
20Pr 6:23 For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life,
20Pr 6:24 keeping you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife.
20Pr 6:25 Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes,
20Pr 6:26 for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.
20Pr 6:27 Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?
20Pr 6:28 Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?
20Pr 6:29 So is he who sleeps with another man's wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.
20Pr 6:30 Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving.
20Pr 6:31 Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house.
20Pr 6:32 But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.
20Pr 6:33 Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away;
20Pr 6:34 for jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
20Pr 6:35 He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse the bribe, however great it is.
20Pr 7:1 My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you.
20Pr 7:2 Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.
20Pr 7:3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.
20Pr 7:4 Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding your kinsman;
20Pr 7:5 they will keep you from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words.
20Pr 7:6 At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice.
20Pr 7:7 I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, a youth who lacked judgment.
20Pr 7:8 He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house
20Pr 7:9 at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in.
20Pr 7:10 Then out came a woman to meet him, dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent.
20Pr 7:11 (She is loud and defiant, her feet never stay at home;
20Pr 7:12 now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.)
20Pr 7:13 She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said£º
20Pr 7:14 "I have fellowship offerings at home; today I fulfilled my vows.
20Pr 7:15 So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you!
20Pr 7:16 I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt.
20Pr 7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
20Pr 7:18 Come, let's drink deep of love till morning; let's enjoy ourselves with love!
20Pr 7:19 My husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.
20Pr 7:20 He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon."
20Pr 7:21 With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk.
20Pr 7:22 All at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose
20Pr 7:23 till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.
20Pr 7:24 Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say.
20Pr 7:25 Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths.
20Pr 7:26 Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng.
20Pr 7:27 Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death.
20Pr 8:1 Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice?
20Pr 8:2 On the heights along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;
20Pr 8:3 beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrances, she cries aloud£º
20Pr 8:4 "To you, O men, I call out; I raise my voice to all mankind.
20Pr 8:5 You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, gain understanding.
20Pr 8:6 Listen, for I have worthy things to say; I open my lips to speak what is right.
20Pr 8:7 My mouth speaks what is true, for my lips detest wickedness.
20Pr 8:8 All the words of my mouth are just; none of them is crooked or perverse.
20Pr 8:9 To the discerning all of them are right; they are faultless to those who have knowledge.
20Pr 8:10 Choose my instruction instead of silver, knowledge rather than choice gold,
20Pr 8:11 for wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire can compare with her.
20Pr 8:12 "I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence; I possess knowledge and discretion.
20Pr 8:13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech.
20Pr 8:14 Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have understanding and power.
20Pr 8:15 By me kings reign and rulers make laws that are just;
20Pr 8:16 by me princes govern, and all nobles who rule on earth.
20Pr 8:17 I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me.
20Pr 8:18 With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and prosperity.
20Pr 8:19 My fruit is better than fine gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.
20Pr 8:20 I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,
20Pr 8:21 bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full.
20Pr 8:22 "The LORD brought me forth as the first of his works, before his deeds of old;
20Pr 8:23 I was appointed from eternity, from the beginning, before the world began.
20Pr 8:24 When there were no oceans, I was given birth, when there were no springs abounding with water;
20Pr 8:25 before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was given birth,
20Pr 8:26 before he made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world.
20Pr 8:27 I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep,
20Pr 8:28 when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,
20Pr 8:29 when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command, and when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
20Pr 8:30 Then I was the craftsman at his side. I was filled with delight day after day, rejoicing always in his presence,
20Pr 8:31 rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind.
20Pr 8:32 "Now then, my sons, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways.
20Pr 8:33 Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.
20Pr 8:34 Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at my doorway.
20Pr 8:35 For whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the LORD.
20Pr 8:36 But whoever fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death."
20Pr 9:1 Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out its seven pillars.
20Pr 9:2 She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
20Pr 9:3 She has sent out her maids, and she calls from the highest point of the city.
20Pr 9:4 "Let all who are simple come in here!" she says to those who lack judgment.
20Pr 9:5 "Come, eat my food and drink the wine I have mixed.
20Pr 9:6 Leave your simple ways and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.
20Pr 9:7 "Whoever corrects a mocker invites insult; whoever rebukes a wicked man incurs abuse.
20Pr 9:8 Do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man and he will love you.
20Pr 9:9 Instruct a wise man and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man and he will add to his learning.
20Pr 9:10 "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
20Pr 9:11 For through me your days will be many, and years will be added to your life.
20Pr 9:12 If you are wise, your wisdom will reward you; if you are a mocker, you alone will suffer."
20Pr 9:13 The woman Folly is loud; she is undisciplined and without knowledge.
20Pr 9:14 She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city,
20Pr 9:15 calling out to those who pass by, who go straight on their way.
20Pr 9:16 "Let all who are simple come in here!" she says to those who lack judgment.
20Pr 9:17 "Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious!"

20Pr 23:7 for he is the kind of man who is always thinking about the cost. "Eat and drink," he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
20Pr 23:8 You will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments.
20Pr 23:9 Do not speak to a fool, for he will scorn the wisdom of your words.
20Pr 23:10 Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
20Pr 23:11 for their Defender is strong; he will take up their case against you.
20Pr 23:12 Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge.
20Pr 23:13 Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with the rod, he will not die.
20Pr 23:14 Punish him with the rod and save his soul from death.
20Pr 23:15 My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad;
20Pr 23:16 my inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.
20Pr 23:17 Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the LORD.
20Pr 23:18 There is surely a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.
20Pr 23:19 Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path.
20Pr 23:20 Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat,
20Pr 23:21 for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags.
20Pr 23:22 Listen to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.
20Pr 23:23 Buy the truth and do not sell it; get wisdom, discipline and understanding.
20Pr 23:24 The father of a righteous man has great joy; he who has a wise son delights in him.
20Pr 23:25 May your father and mother be glad; may she who gave you birth rejoice!
20Pr 23:26 My son, give me your heart and let your eyes keep to my ways,
20Pr 23:27 for a prostitute is a deep pit and a wayward wife is a narrow well.
20Pr 23:28 Like a bandit she lies in wait, and multiplies the unfaithful among men.
20Pr 23:29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?
20Pr 23:30 Those who linger over wine, who go to sample bowls of mixed wine.
20Pr 23:31 Do not gaze at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly!
20Pr 23:32 In the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper.
20Pr 23:33 Your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things.
20Pr 23:34 You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the rigging.
20Pr 23:35 "They hit me," you will say, "but I'm not hurt! They beat me, but I don't feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?"
20Pr 24:1 Do not envy wicked men, do not desire their company;
20Pr 24:2 for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about making trouble.
20Pr 24:3 By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding it is established;
20Pr 24:4 through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures.
20Pr 24:5 A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength;
20Pr 24:6 for waging war you need guidance, and for victory many advisers.
20Pr 24:7 Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the assembly at the gate he has nothing to say.
20Pr 24:8 He who plots evil will be known as a schemer.
20Pr 24:9 The schemes of folly are sin, and men detest a mocker.
20Pr 24:10 If you falter in times of trouble, how small is your strength!
20Pr 24:11 Rescue those being led away to death; hold back those staggering toward slaughter.
20Pr 24:12 If you say, "But we knew nothing about this," does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who guards your life know it? Will he not repay each person according to what he has done?
20Pr 24:13 Eat honey, my son, for it is good; honey from the comb is sweet to your taste.
20Pr 24:14 Know also that wisdom is sweet to your soul; if you find it, there is a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.
20Pr 24:15 Do not lie in wait like an outlaw against a righteous man's house, do not raid his dwelling place;
20Pr 24:16 for though a righteous man falls seven times, he rises again, but the wicked are brought down by calamity.
20Pr 24:17 Do not gloat when your enemy falls; when he stumbles, do not let your heart rejoice,
20Pr 24:18 or the LORD will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from him.
20Pr 24:19 Do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked,
20Pr 24:20 for the evil man has no future hope, and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out.
20Pr 24:21 Fear the LORD and the king, my son, and do not join with the rebellious,
20Pr 24:22 for those two will send sudden destruction upon them, and who knows what calamities they can bring?
20Pr 24:23 These also are sayings of the wise£º To show partiality in judging is not good£º
20Pr 24:24 Whoever says to the guilty, "You are innocent"--peoples will curse him and nations denounce him.
20Pr 24:25 But it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and rich blessing will come upon them.
20Pr 24:26 An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.
20Pr 24:27 Finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready; after that, build your house.
20Pr 24:28 Do not testify against your neighbor without cause, or use your lips to deceive.
20Pr 24:29 Do not say, "I'll do to him as he has done to me; I'll pay that man back for what he did."
20Pr 24:30 I went past the field of the sluggard, past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment;
20Pr 24:31 thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins.
20Pr 24:32 I applied my heart to what I observed and learned a lesson from what I saw£º
20Pr 24:33 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest--
20Pr 24:34 and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man.
20Pr 25:1 These are more proverbs of Solomon, copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah£º
20Pr 25:2 It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; to search out a matter is the glory of kings.
20Pr 25:3 As the heavens are high and the earth is deep, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable.
20Pr 25:4 Remove the dross from the silver, and out comes material for the silversmith;
20Pr 25:5 remove the wicked from the king's presence, and his throne will be established through righteousness.
20Pr 25:6 Do not exalt yourself in the king's presence, and do not claim a place among great men;
20Pr 25:7 it is better for him to say to you, "Come up here," than for him to humiliate you before a nobleman. What you have seen with your eyes
20Pr 25:8 do not bring hastily to court, for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame?
20Pr 25:9 If you argue your case with a neighbor, do not betray another man's confidence,
20Pr 25:10 or he who hears it may shame you and you will never lose your bad reputation.

20Pr 25:12 Like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man's rebuke to a listening ear.
20Pr 25:13 Like the coolness of snow at harvest time is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him; he refreshes the spirit of his masters.
20Pr 25:14 Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give.
20Pr 25:15 Through patience a ruler can be persuaded, and a gentle tongue can break a bone.
20Pr 25:16 If you find honey, eat just enough--too much of it, and you will vomit.
20Pr 25:17 Seldom set foot in your neighbor's house--too much of you, and he will hate you.
20Pr 25:18 Like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is the man who gives false testimony against his neighbor.
20Pr 25:19 Like a bad tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in times of trouble.
20Pr 25:20 Like one who takes away a garment on a cold day, or like vinegar poured on soda, is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
20Pr 25:21 If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.
20Pr 25:22 In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you.
20Pr 25:23 As a north wind brings rain, so a sly tongue brings angry looks.
20Pr 25:24 Better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife.

20Pr 25:26 Like a muddied spring or a polluted well is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked.

20Pr 26:1 Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, honor is not fitting for a fool.
20Pr 26:2 Like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.
20Pr 26:3 A whip for the horse, a halter for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!
20Pr 26:4 Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you will be like him yourself.
20Pr 26:5 Answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes.
20Pr 26:6 Like cutting off one's feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool.
20Pr 26:7 Like a lame man's legs that hang limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
20Pr 26:8 Like tying a stone in a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.
20Pr 26:9 Like a thornbush in a drunkard's hand is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.
20Pr 26:10 Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or any passer-by.
20Pr 26:11 As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.
20Pr 26:12 Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.
20Pr 26:13 The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road, a fierce lion roaming the streets!"
20Pr 26:14 As a door turns on its hinges, so a sluggard turns on his bed.
20Pr 26:15 The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.
20Pr 26:16 The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly.
20Pr 26:17 Like one who seizes a dog by the ears is a passer-by who meddles in a quarrel not his own.
20Pr 26:18 Like a madman shooting firebrands or deadly arrows
20Pr 26:19 is a man who deceives his neighbor and says, "I was only joking!"
20Pr 26:20 Without wood a fire goes out; without gossip a quarrel dies down.
20Pr 26:21 As charcoal to embers and as wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.
20Pr 26:22 The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; they go down to a man's inmost parts.
20Pr 26:23 Like a coating of glaze over earthenware are fervent lips with an evil heart.
20Pr 26:24 A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but in his heart he harbors deceit.
20Pr 26:25 Though his speech is charming, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart.
20Pr 26:26 His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.
20Pr 26:27 If a man digs a pit, he will fall into it; if a man rolls a stone, it will roll back on him.
20Pr 26:28 A lying tongue hates those it hurts, and a flattering mouth works ruin.
20Pr 27:1 Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring forth.
20Pr 27:2 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips.
20Pr 27:3 Stone is heavy and sand a burden, but provocation by a fool is heavier than both.
20Pr 27:4 Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy?
20Pr 27:5 Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
20Pr 27:6 Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses.
20Pr 27:7 He who is full loathes honey, but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet.
20Pr 27:8 Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who strays from his home.
20Pr 27:9 Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of one's friend springs from his earnest counsel.
20Pr 27:10 Do not forsake your friend and the friend of your father, and do not go to your brother's house when disaster strikes you--better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.
20Pr 27:11 Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart; then I can answer anyone who treats me with contempt.
20Pr 27:12 The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and suffer for it.
20Pr 27:13 Take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger; hold it in pledge if he does it for a wayward woman.
20Pr 27:14 If a man loudly blesses his neighbor early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse.
20Pr 27:15 A quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day;
20Pr 27:16 restraining her is like restraining the wind or grasping oil with the hand.
20Pr 27:17 As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.
20Pr 27:18 He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who looks after his master will be honored.

20Pr 27:23 Be sure you know the condition of your flocks, give careful attention to your herds;
20Pr 27:24 for riches do not endure forever, and a crown is not secure for all generations.
20Pr 27:25 When the hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in,
20Pr 27:26 the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.
20Pr 27:27 You will have plenty of goats' milk to feed you and your family and to nourish your servant girls.

20Pr 29:15 The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but a child left to himself disgraces his mother.
20Pr 29:16 When the wicked thrive, so does sin, but the righteous will see their downfall.
20Pr 29:17 Discipline your son, and he will give you peace; he will bring delight to your soul.
20Pr 29:18 Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; but blessed is he who keeps the law.

20Pr 31:25 She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.
20Pr 31:26 She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.
20Pr 31:27 She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.
20Pr 31:28 Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her£º
20Pr 31:29 "Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all."
20Pr 31:30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
20Pr 31:31 Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.

21Ec 1:1 The words of the Teacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem£º
21Ec 1:2 "Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless."
21Ec 1:3 What does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun?
21Ec 1:4 Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.
21Ec 1:5 The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to where it rises.
21Ec 1:6 The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, ever returning on its course.
21Ec 1:7 All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.
21Ec 1:8 All things are wearisome, more than one can say. The eye never has enough of seeing, nor the ear its fill of hearing.
21Ec 1:9 What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.
21Ec 1:10 Is there anything of which one can say, "Look! This is something new"? It was here already, long ago; it was here before our time.
21Ec 1:11 There is no remembrance of men of old, and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow.
21Ec 1:12 I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
21Ec 1:13 I devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a heavy burden God has laid on men!
21Ec 1:14 I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21Ec 1:15 What is twisted cannot be straightened; what is lacking cannot be counted.
21Ec 1:16 I thought to myself, "Look, I have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge."
21Ec 1:17 Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind.
21Ec 1:18 For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.
21Ec 2:1 I thought in my heart, "Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good." But that also proved to be meaningless.
21Ec 2:2 "Laughter," I said, "is foolish. And what does pleasure accomplish?"
21Ec 2:3 I tried cheering myself with wine, and embracing folly--my mind still guiding me with wisdom. I wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives.
21Ec 2:4 I undertook great projects£º I built houses for myself and planted vineyards.
21Ec 2:5 I made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them.
21Ec 2:6 I made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.
21Ec 2:7 I bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in Jerusalem before me.
21Ec 2:8 I amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces. I acquired men and women singers, and a harem as well--the delights of the heart of man.
21Ec 2:9 I became greater by far than anyone in Jerusalem before me. In all this my wisdom stayed with me.
21Ec 2:10 I denied myself nothing my eyes desired; I refused my heart no pleasure. My heart took delight in all my work, and this was the reward for all my labor.
21Ec 2:11 Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun.
21Ec 2:12 Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, and also madness and folly. What more can the king's successor do than what has already been done?
21Ec 2:13 I saw that wisdom is better than folly, just as light is better than darkness.
21Ec 2:14 The wise man has eyes in his head, while the fool walks in the darkness; but I came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both.
21Ec 2:15 Then I thought in my heart, "The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then do I gain by being wise?" I said in my heart, "This too is meaningless."
21Ec 2:16 For the wise man, like the fool, will not be long remembered; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise man too must die!
21Ec 2:17 So I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21Ec 2:18 I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.
21Ec 2:19 And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have control over all the work into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.
21Ec 2:20 So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun.
21Ec 2:21 For a man may do his work with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.
21Ec 2:22 What does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun?
21Ec 2:23 All his days his work is pain and grief; even at night his mind does not rest. This too is meaningless.
21Ec 2:24 A man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,
21Ec 2:25 for without him, who can eat or find enjoyment?
21Ec 2:26 To the man who pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge and happiness, but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21Ec 3:1 There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under heaven£º
21Ec 3:2 a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot,
21Ec 3:3 a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build,
21Ec 3:4 a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,
21Ec 3:5 a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain,
21Ec 3:6 a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away,
21Ec 3:7 a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,
21Ec 3:8 a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.
21Ec 3:9 What does the worker gain from his toil?
21Ec 3:10 I have seen the burden God has laid on men.
21Ec 3:11 He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the hearts of men; yet they cannot fathom what God has done from beginning to end.
21Ec 3:12 I know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live.
21Ec 3:13 That everyone may eat and drink, and find satisfaction in all his toil--this is the gift of God.
21Ec 3:14 I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it. God does it so that men will revere him.
21Ec 3:15 Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God will call the past to account.
21Ec 3:16 And I saw something else under the sun£º In the place of judgment--wickedness was there, in the place of justice--wickedness was there.
21Ec 3:17 I thought in my heart, "God will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there will be a time for every activity, a time for every deed."
21Ec 3:18 I also thought, "As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.
21Ec 3:19 Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both£º As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless.
21Ec 3:20 All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.
21Ec 3:21 Who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth?"
21Ec 3:22 So I saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work, because that is his lot. For who can bring him to see what will happen after him?
21Ec 4:1 Again I looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun£º I saw the tears of the oppressed--and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors--and they have no comforter.
21Ec 4:2 And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive.
21Ec 4:3 But better than both is he who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.
21Ec 4:4 And I saw that all labor and all achievement spring from man's envy of his neighbor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21Ec 4:5 The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.
21Ec 4:6 Better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.
21Ec 4:7 Again I saw something meaningless under the sun£º
21Ec 4:8 There was a man all alone; he had neither son nor brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not content with his wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and why am I depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is meaningless--a miserable business!
21Ec 4:9 Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their work£º
21Ec 4:10 If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!
21Ec 4:11 Also, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?
21Ec 4:12 Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.
21Ec 4:13 Better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning.
21Ec 4:14 The youth may have come from prison to the kingship, or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom.
21Ec 4:15 I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth, the king's successor.
21Ec 4:16 There was no end to all the people who were before them. But those who came later were not pleased with the successor. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21Ec 5:1 Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong.
21Ec 5:2 Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few.
21Ec 5:3 As a dream comes when there are many cares, so the speech of a fool when there are many words.
21Ec 5:4 When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow.
21Ec 5:5 It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it.
21Ec 5:6 Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, "My vow was a mistake." Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands?
21Ec 5:7 Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore stand in awe of God.
21Ec 5:8 If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still.
21Ec 5:9 The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields.
21Ec 5:10 Whoever loves money never has money enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income. This too is meaningless.
21Ec 5:11 As goods increase, so do those who consume them. And what benefit are they to the owner except to feast his eyes on them?
21Ec 5:12 The sleep of a laborer is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of a rich man permits him no sleep.
21Ec 5:13 I have seen a grievous evil under the sun£º wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner,
21Ec 5:14 or wealth lost through some misfortune, so that when he has a son there is nothing left for him.
21Ec 5:15 Naked a man comes from his mother's womb, and as he comes, so he departs. He takes nothing from his labor that he can carry in his hand.
21Ec 5:16 This too is a grievous evil£º As a man comes, so he departs, and what does he gain, since he toils for the wind?
21Ec 5:17 All his days he eats in darkness, with great frustration, affliction and anger.
21Ec 5:18 Then I realized that it is good and proper for a man to eat and drink, and to find satisfaction in his toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given him--for this is his lot.
21Ec 5:19 Moreover, when God gives any man wealth and possessions, and enables him to enjoy them, to accept his lot and be happy in his work--this is a gift of God.
21Ec 5:20 He seldom reflects on the days of his life, because God keeps him occupied with gladness of heart.
21Ec 6:1 I have seen another evil under the sun, and it weighs heavily on men£º
21Ec 6:2 God gives a man wealth, possessions and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires, but God does not enable him to enjoy them, and a stranger enjoys them instead. This is meaningless, a grievous evil.
21Ec 6:3 A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.
21Ec 6:4 It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded.
21Ec 6:5 Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man--
21Ec 6:6 even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?
21Ec 6:7 All man's efforts are for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied.
21Ec 6:8 What advantage has a wise man over a fool? What does a poor man gain by knowing how to conduct himself before others?
21Ec 6:9 Better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
21Ec 6:10 Whatever exists has already been named, and what man is has been known; no man can contend with one who is stronger than he.
21Ec 6:11 The more the words, the less the meaning, and how does that profit anyone?
21Ec 6:12 For who knows what is good for a man in life, during the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow? Who can tell him what will happen under the sun after he is gone?
21Ec 7:1 A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth.
21Ec 7:2 It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of every man; the living should take this to heart.
21Ec 7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart.
21Ec 7:4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
21Ec 7:5 It is better to heed a wise man's rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.
21Ec 7:6 Like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is meaningless.
21Ec 7:7 Extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart.
21Ec 7:8 The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride.
21Ec 7:9 Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools.
21Ec 7:10 Do not say, "Why were the old days better than these?" For it is not wise to ask such questions.
21Ec 7:11 Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun.
21Ec 7:12 Wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is this£º that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor.
21Ec 7:13 Consider what God has done£º Who can straighten what he has made crooked?
21Ec 7:14 When times are good, be happy; but when times are bad, consider£º God has made the one as well as the other. Therefore, a man cannot discover anything about his future.
21Ec 7:15 In this meaningless life of mine I have seen both of these£º a righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.
21Ec 7:16 Do not be overrighteous, neither be overwise--why destroy yourself?
21Ec 7:17 Do not be overwicked, and do not be a fool--why die before your time?
21Ec 7:18 It is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other. The man who fears God will avoid all extremes.
21Ec 7:19 Wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city.
21Ec 7:20 There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.
21Ec 7:21 Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you--
21Ec 7:22 for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.
21Ec 7:23 All this I tested by wisdom and I said, "I am determined to be wise"--but this was beyond me.
21Ec 7:24 Whatever wisdom may be, it is far off and most profound--who can discover it?
21Ec 7:25 So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly.
21Ec 7:26 I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare.
21Ec 7:27 "Look," says the Teacher, "this is what I have discovered£º "Adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things--
21Ec 7:28 while I was still searching but not finding--I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.
21Ec 7:29 This only have I found£º God made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many schemes."
21Ec 8:1 Who is like the wise man? Who knows the explanation of things? Wisdom brightens a man's face and changes its hard appearance.
21Ec 8:2 Obey the king's command, I say, because you took an oath before God.
21Ec 8:3 Do not be in a hurry to leave the king's presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases.
21Ec 8:4 Since a king's word is supreme, who can say to him, "What are you doing?"
21Ec 8:5 Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.
21Ec 8:6 For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a man's misery weighs heavily upon him.
21Ec 8:7 Since no man knows the future, who can tell him what is to come?
21Ec 8:8 No man has power over the wind to contain it; so no one has power over the day of his death. As no one is discharged in time of war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.
21Ec 8:9 All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own hurt.
21Ec 8:10 Then too, I saw the wicked buried--those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless.
21Ec 8:11 When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do wrong.
21Ec 8:12 Although a wicked man commits a hundred crimes and still lives a long time, I know that it will go better with God-fearing men, who are reverent before God.
21Ec 8:13 Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow.
21Ec 8:14 There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth£º righteous men who get what the wicked deserve, and wicked men who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless.
21Ec 8:15 So I commend the enjoyment of life, because nothing is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life God has given him under the sun.
21Ec 8:16 When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe man's labor on earth--his eyes not seeing sleep day or night--
21Ec 8:17 then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all his efforts to search it out, man cannot discover its meaning. Even if a wise man claims he knows, he cannot really comprehend it.
21Ec 9:1 So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God's hands, but no man knows whether love or hate awaits him.
21Ec 9:2 All share a common destiny--the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good man, so with the sinner; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.
21Ec 9:3 This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun£º The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of men, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead.
21Ec 9:4 Anyone who is among the living has hope--even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!
21Ec 9:5 For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even the memory of them is forgotten.
21Ec 9:6 Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun.
21Ec 9:7 Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for it is now that God favors what you do.
21Ec 9:8 Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.
21Ec 9:9 Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun--all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun.
21Ec 9:10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.
21Ec 9:11 I have seen something else under the sun£º The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all.
21Ec 9:12 Moreover, no man knows when his hour will come£º As fish are caught in a cruel net, or birds are taken in a snare, so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them.
21Ec 9:13 I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me£º
21Ec 9:14 There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it.
21Ec 9:15 Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.
21Ec 9:16 So I said, "Wisdom is better than strength." But the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.
21Ec 9:17 The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.
21Ec 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
21Ec 10:1 As dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
21Ec 10:2 The heart of the wise inclines to the right, but the heart of the fool to the left.
21Ec 10:3 Even as he walks along the road, the fool lacks sense and shows everyone how stupid he is.
21Ec 10:4 If a ruler's anger rises against you, do not leave your post; calmness can lay great errors to rest.
21Ec 10:5 There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that arises from a ruler£º
21Ec 10:6 Fools are put in many high positions, while the rich occupy the low ones.
21Ec 10:7 I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.
21Ec 10:8 Whoever digs a pit may fall into it; whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
21Ec 10:9 Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them; whoever splits logs may be endangered by them.
21Ec 10:10 If the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed but skill will bring success.
21Ec 10:11 If a snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.
21Ec 10:12 Words from a wise man's mouth are gracious, but a fool is consumed by his own lips.
21Ec 10:13 At the beginning his words are folly; at the end they are wicked madness--
21Ec 10:14 and the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming--who can tell him what will happen after him?
21Ec 10:15 A fool's work wearies him; he does not know the way to town.
21Ec 10:16 Woe to you, O land whose king was a servant and whose princes feast in the morning.
21Ec 10:17 Blessed are you, O land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time--for strength and not for drunkenness.
21Ec 10:18 If a man is lazy, the rafters sag; if his hands are idle, the house leaks.
21Ec 10:19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.
21Ec 10:20 Do not revile the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich in your bedroom, because a bird of the air may carry your words, and a bird on the wing may report what you say.
21Ec 11:1 Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again.
21Ec 11:2 Give portions to seven, yes to eight, for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.
21Ec 11:3 If clouds are full of water, they pour rain upon the earth. Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls, there will it lie.
21Ec 11:4 Whoever watches the wind will not plant; whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.
21Ec 11:5 As you do not know the path of the wind, or how the body is formed in a mother's womb, so you cannot understand the work of God, the Maker of all things.
21Ec 11:6 Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let not your hands be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well.
21Ec 11:7 Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes to see the sun.
21Ec 11:8 However many years a man may live, let him enjoy them all. But let him remember the days of darkness, for they will be many. Everything to come is meaningless.
21Ec 11:9 Be happy, young man, while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see, but know that for all these things God will bring you to judgment.
21Ec 11:10 So then, banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body, for youth and vigor are meaningless.
21Ec 12:1 Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say, "I find no pleasure in them"--
21Ec 12:2 before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark, and the clouds return after the rain;
21Ec 12:3 when the keepers of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those looking through the windows grow dim;
21Ec 12:4 when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when men rise up at the sound of birds, but all their songs grow faint;
21Ec 12:5 when men are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags himself along and desire no longer is stirred. Then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets.
21Ec 12:6 Remember him--before the silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, or the wheel broken at the well,
21Ec 12:7 and the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
21Ec 12:8 "Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher. "Everything is meaningless!"
21Ec 12:9 Not only was the Teacher wise, but also he imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs.
21Ec 12:10 The Teacher searched to find just the right words, and what he wrote was upright and true.
21Ec 12:11 The words of the wise are like goads, their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails--given by one Shepherd.
21Ec 12:12 Be warned, my son, of anything in addition to them. Of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.
21Ec 12:13 Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter£º Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.
21Ec 12:14 For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.

22Sg 1:1 Solomon's Song of Songs.
22Sg 1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth--for your love is more delightful than wine.
22Sg 1:3 Pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes; your name is like perfume poured out. No wonder the maidens love you!
22Sg 1:4 Take me away with you--let us hurry! Let the king bring me into his chambers. We rejoice and delight in you; we will praise your love more than wine. How right they are to adore you!
22Sg 1:5 Dark am I, yet lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, dark like the tents of Kedar, like the tent curtains of Solomon.
22Sg 1:6 Do not stare at me because I am dark, because I am darkened by the sun. My mother's sons were angry with me and made me take care of the vineyards; my own vineyard I have neglected.
22Sg 1:7 Tell me, you whom I love, where you graze your flock and where you rest your sheep at midday. Why should I be like a veiled woman beside the flocks of your friends?
22Sg 1:8 If you do not know, most beautiful of women, follow the tracks of the sheep and graze your young goats by the tents of the shepherds.
22Sg 1:9 I liken you, my darling, to a mare harnessed to one of the chariots of Pharaoh.
22Sg 1:10 Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings, your neck with strings of jewels.
22Sg 1:11 We will make you earrings of gold, studded with silver.
22Sg 1:12 While the king was at his table, my perfume spread its fragrance.
22Sg 1:13 My lover is to me a sachet of myrrh resting between my breasts.
22Sg 1:14 My lover is to me a cluster of henna blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.
22Sg 1:15 How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are doves.
22Sg 1:16 How handsome you are, my lover! Oh, how charming! And our bed is verdant.
22Sg 1:17 The beams of our house are cedars; our rafters are firs.
22Sg 2:1 I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.
22Sg 2:2 Like a lily among thorns is my darling among the maidens.
22Sg 2:3 Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my lover among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
22Sg 2:4 He has taken me to the banquet hall, and his banner over me is love.
22Sg 2:5 Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.
22Sg 2:6 His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.
22Sg 2:7 Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field£º Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
22Sg 2:8 Listen! My lover! Look! Here he comes, leaping across the mountains, bounding over the hills.
22Sg 2:9 My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the lattice.
22Sg 2:10 My lover spoke and said to me, "Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, and come with me.
22Sg 2:11 See! The winter is past; the rains are over and gone.
22Sg 2:12 Flowers appear on the earth; the season of singing has come, the cooing of doves is heard in our land.
22Sg 2:13 The fig tree forms its early fruit; the blossoming vines spread their fragrance. Arise, come, my darling; my beautiful one, come with me."
22Sg 2:14 My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places on the mountainside, show me your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.
22Sg 2:15 Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that ruin the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom.
22Sg 2:16 My lover is mine and I am his; he browses among the lilies.
22Sg 2:17 Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the rugged hills.
22Sg 3:1 All night long on my bed I looked for the one my heart loves; I looked for him but did not find him.
22Sg 3:2 I will get up now and go about the city, through its streets and squares; I will search for the one my heart loves. So I looked for him but did not find him.
22Sg 3:3 The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. "Have you seen the one my heart loves?"
22Sg 3:4 Scarcely had I passed them when I found the one my heart loves. I held him and would not let him go till I had brought him to my mother's house, to the room of the one who conceived me.
22Sg 3:5 Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you by the gazelles and by the does of the field£º Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
22Sg 3:6 Who is this coming up from the desert like a column of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and incense made from all the spices of the merchant?
22Sg 3:7 Look! It is Solomon's carriage, escorted by sixty warriors, the noblest of Israel,
22Sg 3:8 all of them wearing the sword, all experienced in battle, each with his sword at his side, prepared for the terrors of the night.
22Sg 3:9 King Solomon made for himself the carriage; he made it of wood from Lebanon.
22Sg 3:10 Its posts he made of silver, its base of gold. Its seat was upholstered with purple, its interior lovingly inlaid by the daughters of Jerusalem.
22Sg 3:11 Come out, you daughters of Zion, and look at King Solomon wearing the crown, the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding, the day his heart rejoiced.
22Sg 4:1 How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes behind your veil are doves. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Mount Gilead.
22Sg 4:2 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep just shorn, coming up from the washing. Each has its twin; not one of them is alone.
22Sg 4:3 Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon; your mouth is lovely. Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
22Sg 4:4 Your neck is like the tower of David, built with elegance; on it hang a thousand shields, all of them shields of warriors.
22Sg 4:5 Your two breasts are like two fawns, like twin fawns of a gazelle that browse among the lilies.
22Sg 4:6 Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of incense.
22Sg 4:7 All beautiful you are, my darling; there is no flaw in you.
22Sg 4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. Descend from the crest of Amana, from the top of Senir, the summit of Hermon, from the lions' dens and the mountain haunts of the leopards.
22Sg 4:9 You have stolen my heart, my sister, my bride; you have stolen my heart with one glance of your eyes, with one jewel of your necklace.
22Sg 4:10 How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume than any spice!
22Sg 4:11 Your lips drop sweetness as the honeycomb, my bride; milk and honey are under your tongue. The fragrance of your garments is like that of Lebanon.
22Sg 4:12 You are a garden locked up, my sister, my bride; you are a spring enclosed, a sealed fountain.
22Sg 4:13 Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates with choice fruits, with henna and nard,
22Sg 4:14 nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree, with myrrh and aloes and all the finest spices.
22Sg 4:15 You are a garden fountain, a well of flowing water streaming down from Lebanon.
22Sg 4:16 Awake, north wind, and come, south wind! Blow on my garden, that its fragrance may spread abroad. Let my lover come into his garden and taste its choice fruits.
22Sg 5:1 I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, O friends, and drink; drink your fill, O lovers.
22Sg 5:2 I slept but my heart was awake. Listen! My lover is knocking£º "Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night."
22Sg 5:3 I have taken off my robe--must I put it on again? I have washed my feet--must I soil them again?
22Sg 5:4 My lover thrust his hand through the latch-opening; my heart began to pound for him.
22Sg 5:5 I arose to open for my lover, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh, on the handles of the lock.
22Sg 5:6 I opened for my lover, but my lover had left; he was gone. My heart sank at his departure. I looked for him but did not find him. I called him but he did not answer.
22Sg 5:7 The watchmen found me as they made their rounds in the city. They beat me, they bruised me; they took away my cloak, those watchmen of the walls!
22Sg 5:8 O daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you--if you find my lover, what will you tell him? Tell him I am faint with love.
22Sg 5:9 How is your beloved better than others, most beautiful of women? How is your beloved better than others, that you charge us so?
22Sg 5:10 My lover is radiant and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.
22Sg 5:11 His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.
22Sg 5:12 His eyes are like doves by the water streams, washed in milk, mounted like jewels.
22Sg 5:13 His cheeks are like beds of spice yielding perfume. His lips are like lilies dripping with myrrh.
22Sg 5:14 His arms are rods of gold set with chrysolite. His body is like polished ivory decorated with sapphires.
22Sg 5:15 His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice as its cedars.
22Sg 5:16 His mouth is sweetness itself; he is altogether lovely. This is my lover, this my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
22Sg 6:1 Where has your lover gone, most beautiful of women? Which way did your lover turn, that we may look for him with you?
22Sg 6:2 My lover has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to browse in the gardens and to gather lilies.
22Sg 6:3 I am my lover's and my lover is mine; he browses among the lilies.
22Sg 6:4 You are beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah, lovely as Jerusalem, majestic as troops with banners.
22Sg 6:5 Turn your eyes from me; they overwhelm me. Your hair is like a flock of goats descending from Gilead.
22Sg 6:6 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing. Each has its twin, not one of them is alone.
22Sg 6:7 Your temples behind your veil are like the halves of a pomegranate.
22Sg 6:8 Sixty queens there may be, and eighty concubines, and virgins beyond number;
22Sg 6:9 but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the only daughter of her mother, the favorite of the one who bore her. The maidens saw her and called her blessed; the queens and concubines praised her.
22Sg 6:10 Who is this that appears like the dawn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, majestic as the stars in procession?
22Sg 6:11 I went down to the grove of nut trees to look at the new growth in the valley, to see if the vines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom.
22Sg 6:12 Before I realized it, my desire set me among the royal chariots of my people.
22Sg 6:13 Come back, come back, O Shulammite; come back, come back, that we may gaze on you! Why would you gaze on the Shulammite as on the dance of Mahanaim?
22Sg 7:1 How beautiful your sandaled feet, O prince's daughter! Your graceful legs are like jewels, the work of a craftsman's hands.
22Sg 7:2 Your navel is a rounded goblet that never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by lilies.
22Sg 7:3 Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
22Sg 7:4 Your neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon looking toward Damascus.
22Sg 7:5 Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel. Your hair is like royal tapestry; the king is held captive by its tresses.
22Sg 7:6 How beautiful you are and how pleasing, O love, with your delights!
22Sg 7:7 Your stature is like that of the palm, and your breasts like clusters of fruit.
22Sg 7:8 I said, "I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit." May your breasts be like the clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples,
22Sg 7:9 and your mouth like the best wine. May the wine go straight to my lover, flowing gently over lips and teeth.
22Sg 7:10 I belong to my lover, and his desire is for me.
22Sg 7:11 Come, my lover, let us go to the countryside, let us spend the night in the villages.
22Sg 7:12 Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vines have budded, if their blossoms have opened, and if the pomegranates are in bloom--there I will give you my love.
22Sg 7:13 The mandrakes send out their fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, both new and old, that I have stored up for you, my lover.
22Sg 8:1 If only you were to me like a brother, who was nursed at my mother's breasts! Then, if I found you outside, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.
22Sg 8:2 I would lead you and bring you to my mother's house--she who has taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.
22Sg 8:3 His left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me.
22Sg 8:4 Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you£º Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires.
22Sg 8:5 Who is this coming up from the desert leaning on her lover? Under the apple tree I roused you; there your mother conceived you, there she who was in labor gave you birth.
22Sg 8:6 Place me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm; for love is as strong as death, its jealousy unyielding as the grave. It burns like blazing fire, like a mighty flame.
22Sg 8:7 Many waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot wash it away. If one were to give all the wealth of his house for love, it would be utterly scorned.
22Sg 8:8 We have a young sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister for the day she is spoken for?
22Sg 8:9 If she is a wall, we will build towers of silver on her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.
22Sg 8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. Thus I have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment.
22Sg 8:11 Solomon had a vineyard in Baal Hamon; he let out his vineyard to tenants. Each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels of silver.
22Sg 8:12 But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, O Solomon, and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.
22Sg 8:13 You who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!
22Sg 8:14 Come away, my lover, and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice-laden mountains.

23Is 1:1 The vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
23Is 1:2 Hear, O heavens! Listen, O earth! For the LORD has spoken£º "I reared children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against me.
23Is 1:3 The ox knows his master, the donkey his owner's manger, but Israel does not know, my people do not understand."
23Is 1:4 Ah, sinful nation, a people loaded with guilt, a brood of evildoers, children given to corruption! They have forsaken the LORD; they have spurned the Holy One of Israel and turned their backs on him.
23Is 1:5 Why should you be beaten anymore? Why do you persist in rebellion? Your whole head is injured, your whole heart afflicted.
23Is 1:6 From the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness--only wounds and welts and open sores, not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil.
23Is 1:7 Your country is desolate, your cities burned with fire; your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you, laid waste as when overthrown by strangers.
23Is 1:8 The Daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a city under siege.
23Is 1:9 Unless the LORD Almighty had left us some survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.
23Is 1:10 Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
23Is 1:11 "The multitude of your sacrifices--what are they to me?" says the LORD. "I have more than enough of burnt offerings, of rams and the fat of fattened animals; I have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats.
23Is 1:12 When you come to appear before me, who has asked this of you, this trampling of my courts?
23Is 1:13 Stop bringing meaningless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me. New Moons, Sabbaths and convocations--I cannot bear your evil assemblies.
23Is 1:14 Your New Moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They have become a burden to me; I am weary of bearing them.
23Is 1:15 When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you; even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood;
23Is 1:16 wash and make yourselves clean. Take your evil deeds out of my sight! Stop doing wrong,
23Is 1:17 learn to do right! Seek justice, encourage the oppressed. Defend the cause of the fatherless, plead the case of the widow.
23Is 1:18 "Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. "Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.
23Is 1:19 If you are willing and obedient, you will eat the best from the land;
23Is 1:20 but if you resist and rebel, you will be devoured by the sword." For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23Is 1:21 See how the faithful city has become a harlot! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her--but now murderers!
23Is 1:22 Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water.
23Is 1:23 Your rulers are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.
23Is 1:24 Therefore the Lord, the LORD Almighty, the Mighty One of Israel, declares£º "Ah, I will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies.
23Is 1:25 I will turn my hand against you; I will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities.
23Is 1:26 I will restore your judges as in days of old, your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you will be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City."
23Is 1:27 Zion will be redeemed with justice, her penitent ones with righteousness.
23Is 1:28 But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and those who forsake the LORD will perish.
23Is 1:29 "You will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted; you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen.
23Is 1:30 You will be like an oak with fading leaves, like a garden without water.
23Is 1:31 The mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark; both will burn together, with no one to quench the fire."
23Is 2:1 This is what Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem£º
23Is 2:2 In the last days the mountain of the LORD'S temple will be established as chief among the mountains; it will be raised above the hills, and all nations will stream to it.
23Is 2:3 Many peoples will come and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will teach us his ways, so that we may walk in his paths." The law will go out from Zion, the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
23Is 2:4 He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will not take up sword against nation, nor will they train for war anymore.
23Is 2:5 Come, O house of Jacob, let us walk in the light of the LORD.
23Is 2:6 You have abandoned your people, the house of Jacob. They are full of superstitions from the East; they practice divination like the Philistines and clasp hands with pagans.
23Is 2:7 Their land is full of silver and gold; there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses; there is no end to their chariots.
23Is 2:8 Their land is full of idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their fingers have made.
23Is 2:9 So man will be brought low and mankind humbled--do not forgive them.
23Is 2:10 Go into the rocks, hide in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty!
23Is 2:11 The eyes of the arrogant man will be humbled and the pride of men brought low; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
23Is 2:12 The LORD Almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty, for all that is exalted (and they will be humbled),
23Is 2:13 for all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and lofty, and all the oaks of Bashan,
23Is 2:14 for all the towering mountains and all the high hills,
23Is 2:15 for every lofty tower and every fortified wall,
23Is 2:16 for every trading ship and every stately vessel.
23Is 2:17 The arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled; the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,
23Is 2:18 and the idols will totally disappear.
23Is 2:19 Men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.
23Is 2:20 In that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold, which they made to worship.
23Is 2:21 They will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the LORD and the splendor of his majesty, when he rises to shake the earth.
23Is 2:22 Stop trusting in man, who has but a breath in his nostrils. Of what account is he?
23Is 3:1 See now, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, is about to take from Jerusalem and Judah both supply and support£º all supplies of food and all supplies of water,
23Is 3:2 the hero and warrior, the judge and prophet, the soothsayer and elder,
23Is 3:3 the captain of fifty and man of rank, the counselor, skilled craftsman and clever enchanter.
23Is 3:4 I will make boys their officials; mere children will govern them.
23Is 3:5 People will oppress each other--man against man, neighbor against neighbor. The young will rise up against the old, the base against the honorable.
23Is 3:6 A man will seize one of his brothers at his father's home, and say, "You have a cloak, you be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!"
23Is 3:7 But in that day he will cry out, "I have no remedy. I have no food or clothing in my house; do not make me the leader of the people."
23Is 3:8 Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.
23Is 3:9 The look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves.
23Is 3:10 Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds.
23Is 3:11 Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them! They will be paid back for what their hands have done.
23Is 3:12 Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.
23Is 3:13 The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people.
23Is 3:14 The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people£º "It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses.
23Is 3:15 What do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.
23Is 3:16 The LORD says, "The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles.
23Is 3:17 Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald."
23Is 3:18 In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery£º the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces,
23Is 3:19 the earrings and bracelets and veils,
23Is 3:20 the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms,
23Is 3:21 the signet rings and nose rings,
23Is 3:22 the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses
23Is 3:23 and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.
23Is 3:24 Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding.
23Is 3:25 Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle.
23Is 3:26 The gates of Zion will lament and mourn; destitute, she will sit on the ground.
23Is 4:1 In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, "We will eat our own food and provide our own clothes; only let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!"
23Is 4:2 In that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in Israel.
23Is 4:3 Those who are left in Zion, who remain in Jerusalem, will be called holy, all who are recorded among the living in Jerusalem.
23Is 4:4 The Lord will wash away the filth of the women of Zion; he will cleanse the bloodstains from Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.
23Is 4:5 Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night; over all the glory will be a canopy.
23Is 4:6 It will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain.
23Is 5:1 I will sing for the one I love a song about his vineyard£º My loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.
23Is 5:2 He dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it yielded only bad fruit.
23Is 5:3 "Now you dwellers in Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.
23Is 5:4 What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I looked for good grapes, why did it yield only bad?
23Is 5:5 Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard£º I will take away its hedge, and it will be destroyed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.
23Is 5:6 I will make it a wasteland, neither pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it."
23Is 5:7 The vineyard of the LORD Almighty is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden of his delight. And he looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.
23Is 5:8 Woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land.
23Is 5:9 The LORD Almighty has declared in my hearing£º "Surely the great houses will become desolate, the fine mansions left without occupants.
23Is 5:10 A ten-acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine, a homer of seed only an ephah of grain."
23Is 5:11 Woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine.
23Is 5:12 They have harps and lyres at their banquets, tambourines and flutes and wine, but they have no regard for the deeds of the LORD, no respect for the work of his hands.
23Is 5:13 Therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding; their men of rank will die of hunger and their masses will be parched with thirst.
23Is 5:14 Therefore the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit; into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers.
23Is 5:15 So man will be brought low and mankind humbled, the eyes of the arrogant humbled.
23Is 5:16 But the LORD Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will show himself holy by his righteousness.
23Is 5:17 Then sheep will graze as in their own pasture; lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich.
23Is 5:18 Woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes,
23Is 5:19 to those who say, "Let God hurry, let him hasten his work so we may see it. Let it approach, let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come, so we may know it."
23Is 5:20 Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.
23Is 5:21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight.
23Is 5:22 Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks,
23Is 5:23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice to the innocent.
23Is 5:24 Therefore, as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames, so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 5:25 Therefore the LORD'S anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23Is 5:26 He lifts up a banner for the distant nations, he whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily!
23Is 5:27 Not one of them grows tired or stumbles, not one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, not a sandal thong is broken.
23Is 5:28 Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are strung; their horses' hoofs seem like flint, their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.
23Is 5:29 Their roar is like that of the lion, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue.
23Is 5:30 In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, he will see darkness and distress; even the light will be darkened by the clouds.
23Is 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, and the train of his robe filled the temple.
23Is 6:2 Above him were seraphs, each with six wings£º With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
23Is 6:3 And they were calling to one another£º "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory."
23Is 6:4 At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke.
23Is 6:5 "Woe to me!" I cried. "I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty."
23Is 6:6 Then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.
23Is 6:7 With it he touched my mouth and said, "See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for."
23Is 6:8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?" And I said, "Here am I. Send me!"
23Is 6:9 He said, "Go and tell this people£º "'Be ever hearing, but never understanding; be ever seeing, but never perceiving.'
23Is 6:10 Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."
23Is 6:11 Then I said, "For how long, O Lord?" And he answered£º "Until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant, until the houses are left deserted and the fields ruined and ravaged,
23Is 6:12 until the LORD has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken.
23Is 6:13 And though a tenth remains in the land, it will again be laid waste. But as the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down, so the holy seed will be the stump in the land."
23Is 7:1 When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it.
23Is 7:2 Now the house of David was told, "Aram has allied itself with Ephraim"; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind.
23Is 7:3 Then the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub, to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field.
23Is 7:4 Say to him, 'Be careful, keep calm and don't be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood--because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
23Is 7:5 Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah's son have plotted your ruin, saying,
23Is 7:6 "Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it."
23Is 7:7 Yet this is what the Sovereign LORD says£º "'It will not take place, it will not happen,
23Is 7:8 for the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people.
23Is 7:9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah's son. If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.'"
23Is 7:10 Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,
23Is 7:11 "Ask the LORD your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights."
23Is 7:12 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask; I will not put the LORD to the test."
23Is 7:13 Then Isaiah said, "Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also?
23Is 7:14 Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign£º The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.
23Is 7:15 He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right.
23Is 7:16 But before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste.
23Is 7:17 The LORD will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah--he will bring the king of Assyria."
23Is 7:18 In that day the LORD will whistle for flies from the distant streams of Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria.
23Is 7:19 They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes.
23Is 7:20 In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the River--the king of Assyria--to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to take off your beards also.
23Is 7:21 In that day, a man will keep alive a young cow and two goats.
23Is 7:22 And because of the abundance of the milk they give, he will have curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey.
23Is 7:23 In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels, there will be only briers and thorns.
23Is 7:24 Men will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns.
23Is 7:25 As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run.
23Is 8:1 The LORD said to me, "Take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen£º Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
23Is 8:2 And I will call in Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me."
23Is 8:3 Then I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. And the LORD said to me, "Name him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
23Is 8:4 Before the boy knows how to say 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria."
23Is 8:5 The LORD spoke to me again£º
23Is 8:6 "Because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
23Is 8:7 therefore the Lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the River--the king of Assyria with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks
23Is 8:8 and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, O Immanuel!"
23Is 8:9 Raise the war cry, you nations, and be shattered! Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered! Prepare for battle, and be shattered!
23Is 8:10 Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; propose your plan, but it will not stand, for God is with us.
23Is 8:11 The LORD spoke to me with his strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people. He said£º
23Is 8:12 "Do not call conspiracy everything that these people call conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, and do not dread it.
23Is 8:13 The LORD Almighty is the one you are to regard as holy, he is the one you are to fear, he is the one you are to dread,
23Is 8:14 and he will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel he will be a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.
23Is 8:15 Many of them will stumble; they will fall and be broken, they will be snared and captured."
23Is 8:16 Bind up the testimony and seal up the law among my disciples.
23Is 8:17 I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob. I will put my trust in him.
23Is 8:18 Here am I, and the children the LORD has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the LORD Almighty, who dwells on Mount Zion.
23Is 8:19 When men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists, who whisper and mutter, should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?
23Is 8:20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, they have no light of dawn.
23Is 8:21 Distressed and hungry, they will roam through the land; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.
23Is 8:22 Then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom, and they will be thrust into utter darkness.
23Is 9:1 Nevertheless, there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress. In the past he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the future he will honor Galilee of the Gentiles, by the way of the sea, along the Jordan--
23Is 9:2 The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned.
23Is 9:3 You have enlarged the nation and increased their joy; they rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest, as men rejoice when dividing the plunder.
23Is 9:4 For as in the day of Midian's defeat, you have shattered the yoke that burdens them, the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor.
23Is 9:5 Every warrior's boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning, will be fuel for the fire.
23Is 9:6 For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
23Is 9:7 Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.
23Is 9:8 The Lord has sent a message against Jacob; it will fall on Israel.
23Is 9:9 All the people will know it--Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria--who say with pride and arrogance of heart,
23Is 9:10 "The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with dressed stone; the fig trees have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars."
23Is 9:11 But the LORD has strengthened Rezin's foes against them and has spurred their enemies on.
23Is 9:12 Arameans from the east and Philistines from the west have devoured Israel with open mouth. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23Is 9:13 But the people have not returned to him who struck them, nor have they sought the LORD Almighty.
23Is 9:14 So the LORD will cut off from Israel both head and tail, both palm branch and reed in a single day;
23Is 9:15 the elders and prominent men are the head, the prophets who teach lies are the tail.
23Is 9:16 Those who guide this people mislead them, and those who are guided are led astray.
23Is 9:17 Therefore the Lord will take no pleasure in the young men, nor will he pity the fatherless and widows, for everyone is ungodly and wicked, every mouth speaks vileness. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23Is 9:18 Surely wickedness burns like a fire; it consumes briers and thorns, it sets the forest thickets ablaze, so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke.
23Is 9:19 By the wrath of the LORD Almighty the land will be scorched and the people will be fuel for the fire; no one will spare his brother.
23Is 9:20 On the right they will devour, but still be hungry; on the left they will eat, but not be satisfied. Each will feed on the flesh of his own offspring£º
23Is 9:21 Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, and Ephraim on Manasseh; together they will turn against Judah. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23Is 10:1 Woe to those who make unjust laws, to those who issue oppressive decrees,
23Is 10:2 to deprive the poor of their rights and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people, making widows their prey and robbing the fatherless.
23Is 10:3 What will you do on the day of reckoning, when disaster comes from afar? To whom will you run for help? Where will you leave your riches?
23Is 10:4 Nothing will remain but to cringe among the captives or fall among the slain. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.
23Is 10:5 "Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of my anger, in whose hand is the club of my wrath!
23Is 10:6 I send him against a godless nation, I dispatch him against a people who anger me, to seize loot and snatch plunder, and to trample them down like mud in the streets.
23Is 10:7 But this is not what he intends, this is not what he has in mind; his purpose is to destroy, to put an end to many nations.
23Is 10:8 'Are not my commanders all kings?' he says.
23Is 10:9 'Has not Calno fared like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad, and Samaria like Damascus?
23Is 10:10 As my hand seized the kingdoms of the idols, kingdoms whose images excelled those of Jerusalem and Samaria--
23Is 10:11 shall I not deal with Jerusalem and her images as I dealt with Samaria and her idols?'"
23Is 10:12 When the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will say, "I will punish the king of Assyria for the willful pride of his heart and the haughty look in his eyes.
23Is 10:13 For he says£º "'By the strength of my hand I have done this, and by my wisdom, because I have understanding. I removed the boundaries of nations, I plundered their treasures; like a mighty one I subdued their kings.
23Is 10:14 As one reaches into a nest, so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations; as men gather abandoned eggs, so I gathered all the countries; not one flapped a wing, or opened its mouth to chirp.'"
23Is 10:15 Does the ax raise itself above him who swings it, or the saw boast against him who uses it? As if a rod were to wield him who lifts it up, or a club brandish him who is not wood!
23Is 10:16 Therefore, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will send a wasting disease upon his sturdy warriors; under his pomp a fire will be kindled like a blazing flame.
23Is 10:17 The Light of Israel will become a fire, their Holy One a flame; in a single day it will burn and consume his thorns and his briers.
23Is 10:18 The splendor of his forests and fertile fields it will completely destroy, as when a sick man wastes away.
23Is 10:19 And the remaining trees of his forests will be so few that a child could write them down.
23Is 10:20 In that day the remnant of Israel, the survivors of the house of Jacob, will no longer rely on him who struck them down but will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 10:21 A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God.
23Is 10:22 Though your people, O Israel, be like the sand by the sea, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, overwhelming and righteous.
23Is 10:23 The Lord, the LORD Almighty, will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land.
23Is 10:24 Therefore, this is what the Lord, the LORD Almighty, says£º "O my people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians, who beat you with a rod and lift up a club against you, as Egypt did.
23Is 10:25 Very soon my anger against you will end and my wrath will be directed to their destruction."
23Is 10:26 The LORD Almighty will lash them with a whip, as when he struck down Midian at the rock of Oreb; and he will raise his staff over the waters, as he did in Egypt.
23Is 10:27 In that day their burden will be lifted from your shoulders, their yoke from your neck; the yoke will be broken because you have grown so fat.
23Is 10:28 They enter Aiath; they pass through Migron; they store supplies at Micmash.
23Is 10:29 They go over the pass, and say, "We will camp overnight at Geba." Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees.
23Is 10:30 Cry out, O Daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! Poor Anathoth!
23Is 10:31 Madmenah is in flight; the people of Gebim take cover.
23Is 10:32 This day they will halt at Nob; they will shake their fist at the mount of the Daughter of Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.
23Is 10:33 See, the Lord, the LORD Almighty, will lop off the boughs with great power. The lofty trees will be felled, the tall ones will be brought low.
23Is 10:34 He will cut down the forest thickets with an ax; Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.
23Is 11:1 A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.
23Is 11:2 The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him--the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel and of power, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD--
23Is 11:3 and he will delight in the fear of the LORD. He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes, or decide by what he hears with his ears;
23Is 11:4 but with righteousness he will judge the needy, with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth. He will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked.
23Is 11:5 Righteousness will be his belt and faithfulness the sash around his waist.
23Is 11:6 The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them.
23Is 11:7 The cow will feed with the bear, their young will lie down together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox.
23Is 11:8 The infant will play near the hole of the cobra, and the young child put his hand into the viper's nest.
23Is 11:9 They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea.
23Is 11:10 In that day the Root of Jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples; the nations will rally to him, and his place of rest will be glorious.
23Is 11:11 In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the remnant that is left of his people from Assyria, from Lower Egypt, from Upper Egypt, from Cush, from Elam, from Babylonia, from Hamath and from the islands of the sea.
23Is 11:12 He will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of Israel; he will assemble the scattered people of Judah from the four quarters of the earth.
23Is 11:13 Ephraim's jealousy will vanish, and Judah's enemies will be cut off; Ephraim will not be jealous of Judah, nor Judah hostile toward Ephraim.
23Is 11:14 They will swoop down on the slopes of Philistia to the west; together they will plunder the people to the east. They will lay hands on Edom and Moab, and the Ammonites will be subject to them.
23Is 11:15 The LORD will dry up the gulf of the Egyptian sea; with a scorching wind he will sweep his hand over the Euphrates River. He will break it up into seven streams so that men can cross over in sandals.
23Is 11:16 There will be a highway for the remnant of his people that is left from Assyria, as there was for Israel when they came up from Egypt.
23Is 12:1 In that day you will say£º "I will praise you, O LORD. Although you were angry with me, your anger has turned away and you have comforted me.
23Is 12:2 Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The LORD, the LORD, is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation."
23Is 12:3 With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.
23Is 12:4 In that day you will say£º "Give thanks to the LORD, call on his name; make known among the nations what he has done, and proclaim that his name is exalted.
23Is 12:5 Sing to the LORD, for he has done glorious things; let this be known to all the world.
23Is 12:6 Shout aloud and sing for joy, people of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel among you."
23Is 13:1 An oracle concerning Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz saw£º
23Is 13:2 Raise a banner on a bare hilltop, shout to them; beckon to them to enter the gates of the nobles.
23Is 13:3 I have commanded my holy ones; I have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath--those who rejoice in my triumph.
23Is 13:4 Listen, a noise on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations massing together! The LORD Almighty is mustering an army for war.
23Is 13:5 They come from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens--the LORD and the weapons of his wrath--to destroy the whole country.
23Is 13:6 Wail, for the day of the LORD is near; it will come like destruction from the Almighty.
23Is 13:7 Because of this, all hands will go limp, every man's heart will melt.
23Is 13:8 Terror will seize them, pain and anguish will grip them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look aghast at each other, their faces aflame.
23Is 13:9 See, the day of the LORD is coming--a cruel day, with wrath and fierce anger--to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it.
23Is 13:10 The stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light. The rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light.
23Is 13:11 I will punish the world for its evil, the wicked for their sins. I will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless.
23Is 13:12 I will make man scarcer than pure gold, more rare than the gold of Ophir.
23Is 13:13 Therefore I will make the heavens tremble; and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the LORD Almighty, in the day of his burning anger.
23Is 13:14 Like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land.
23Is 13:15 Whoever is captured will be thrust through; all who are caught will fall by the sword.
23Is 13:16 Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives ravished.
23Is 13:17 See, I will stir up against them the Medes, who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold.
23Is 13:18 Their bows will strike down the young men; they will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children.
23Is 13:19 Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the glory of the Babylonians' pride, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.
23Is 13:20 She will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flocks there.
23Is 13:21 But desert creatures will lie there, jackals will fill her houses; there the owls will dwell, and there the wild goats will leap about.
23Is 13:22 Hyenas will howl in her strongholds, jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged.
23Is 14:1 The LORD will have compassion on Jacob; once again he will choose Israel and will settle them in their own land. Aliens will join them and unite with the house of Jacob.
23Is 14:2 Nations will take them and bring them to their own place. And the house of Israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the LORD'S land. They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors.
23Is 14:3 On the day the LORD gives you relief from suffering and turmoil and cruel bondage,
23Is 14:4 you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon£º How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!
23Is 14:5 The LORD has broken the rod of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers,
23Is 14:6 which in anger struck down peoples with unceasing blows, and in fury subdued nations with relentless aggression.
23Is 14:7 All the lands are at rest and at peace; they break into singing.
23Is 14:8 Even the pine trees and the cedars of Lebanon exult over you and say, "Now that you have been laid low, no woodsman comes to cut us down."
23Is 14:9 The grave below is all astir to meet you at your coming; it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you--all those who were leaders in the world; it makes them rise from their thrones--all those who were kings over the nations.
23Is 14:10 They will all respond, they will say to you, "You also have become weak, as we are; you have become like us."
23Is 14:11 All your pomp has been brought down to the grave, along with the noise of your harps; maggots are spread out beneath you and worms cover you.
23Is 14:12 How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!
23Is 14:13 You said in your heart, "I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain.
23Is 14:14 I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High."
23Is 14:15 But you are brought down to the grave, to the depths of the pit.
23Is 14:16 Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate£º "Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble,
23Is 14:17 the man who made the world a desert, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?"
23Is 14:18 All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb.
23Is 14:19 But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit. Like a corpse trampled underfoot,
23Is 14:20 you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again.
23Is 14:21 Prepare a place to slaughter his sons for the sins of their forefathers; they are not to rise to inherit the land and cover the earth with their cities.
23Is 14:22 "I will rise up against them," declares the LORD Almighty. "I will cut off from Babylon her name and survivors, her offspring and descendants," declares the LORD.
23Is 14:23 "I will turn her into a place for owls and into swampland; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction," declares the LORD Almighty.
23Is 14:24 The LORD Almighty has sworn, "Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand.
23Is 14:25 I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains I will trample him down. His yoke will be taken from my people, and his burden removed from their shoulders."
23Is 14:26 This is the plan determined for the whole world; this is the hand stretched out over all nations.
23Is 14:27 For the LORD Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart him? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?
23Is 14:28 This oracle came in the year King Ahaz died£º
23Is 14:29 Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that snake will spring up a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent.
23Is 14:30 The poorest of the poor will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But your root I will destroy by famine; it will slay your survivors.
23Is 14:31 Wail, O gate! Howl, O city! Melt away, all you Philistines! A cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there is not a straggler in its ranks.
23Is 14:32 What answer shall be given to the envoys of that nation? "The LORD has established Zion, and in her his afflicted people will find refuge."
23Is 15:1 An oracle concerning Moab£º Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night!
23Is 15:2 Dibon goes up to its temple, to its high places to weep; Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba. Every head is shaved and every beard cut off.
23Is 15:3 In the streets they wear sackcloth; on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail, prostrate with weeping.
23Is 15:4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, their voices are heard all the way to Jahaz. Therefore the armed men of Moab cry out, and their hearts are faint.
23Is 15:5 My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath Shelishiyah. They go up the way to Luhith, weeping as they go; on the road to Horonaim they lament their destruction.
23Is 15:6 The waters of Nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left.
23Is 15:7 So the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the Ravine of the Poplars.
23Is 15:8 Their outcry echoes along the border of Moab; their wailing reaches as far as Eglaim, their lamentation as far as Beer Elim.
23Is 15:9 Dimon's waters are full of blood, but I will bring still more upon Dimon--a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon those who remain in the land.
23Is 16:1 Send lambs as tribute to the ruler of the land, from Sela, across the desert, to the mount of the Daughter of Zion.
23Is 16:2 Like fluttering birds pushed from the nest, so are the women of Moab at the fords of the Arnon.
23Is 16:3 "Give us counsel, render a decision. Make your shadow like night--at high noon. Hide the fugitives, do not betray the refugees.
23Is 16:4 Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you; be their shelter from the destroyer." The oppressor will come to an end, and destruction will cease; the aggressor will vanish from the land.
23Is 16:5 In love a throne will be established; in faithfulness a man will sit on it--one from the house of David--one who in judging seeks justice and speeds the cause of righteousness.
23Is 16:6 We have heard of Moab's pride--her overweening pride and conceit, her pride and her insolence--but her boasts are empty.
23Is 16:7 Therefore the Moabites wail, they wail together for Moab. Lament and grieve for the men of Kir Hareseth.
23Is 16:8 The fields of Heshbon wither, the vines of Sibmah also. The rulers of the nations have trampled down the choicest vines, which once reached Jazer and spread toward the desert. Their shoots spread out and went as far as the sea.
23Is 16:9 So I weep, as Jazer weeps, for the vines of Sibmah. O Heshbon, O Elealeh, I drench you with tears! The shouts of joy over your ripened fruit and over your harvests have been stilled.
23Is 16:10 Joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards; no one sings or shouts in the vineyards; no one treads out wine at the presses, for I have put an end to the shouting.
23Is 16:11 My heart laments for Moab like a harp, my inmost being for Kir Hareseth.
23Is 16:12 When Moab appears at her high place, she only wears herself out; when she goes to her shrine to pray, it is to no avail.
23Is 16:13 This is the word the LORD has already spoken concerning Moab.
23Is 16:14 But now the LORD says£º "Within three years, as a servant bound by contract would count them, Moab's splendor and all her many people will be despised, and her survivors will be very few and feeble."
23Is 17:1 An oracle concerning Damascus£º "See, Damascus will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins.
23Is 17:2 The cities of Aroer will be deserted and left to flocks, which will lie down, with no one to make them afraid.
23Is 17:3 The fortified city will disappear from Ephraim, and royal power from Damascus; the remnant of Aram will be like the glory of the Israelites," declares the LORD Almighty.
23Is 17:4 "In that day the glory of Jacob will fade; the fat of his body will waste away.
23Is 17:5 It will be as when a reaper gathers the standing grain and harvests the grain with his arm--as when a man gleans heads of grain in the Valley of Rephaim.
23Is 17:6 Yet some gleanings will remain, as when an olive tree is beaten, leaving two or three olives on the topmost branches, four or five on the fruitful boughs," declares the LORD, the God of Israel.
23Is 17:7 In that day men will look to their Maker and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 17:8 They will not look to the altars, the work of their hands, and they will have no regard for the Asherah poles and the incense altars their fingers have made.
23Is 17:9 In that day their strong cities, which they left because of the Israelites, will be like places abandoned to thickets and undergrowth. And all will be desolation.
23Is 17:10 You have forgotten God your Savior; you have not remembered the Rock, your fortress. Therefore, though you set out the finest plants and plant imported vines,
23Is 17:11 though on the day you set them out, you make them grow, and on the morning when you plant them, you bring them to bud, yet the harvest will be as nothing in the day of disease and incurable pain.
23Is 17:12 Oh, the raging of many nations--they rage like the raging sea! Oh, the uproar of the peoples--they roar like the roaring of great waters!
23Is 17:13 Although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters, when he rebukes them they flee far away, driven before the wind like chaff on the hills, like tumbleweed before a gale.
23Is 17:14 In the evening, sudden terror! Before the morning, they are gone! This is the portion of those who loot us, the lot of those who plunder us.
23Is 18:1 Woe to the land of whirring wings along the rivers of Cush,
23Is 18:2 which sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats over the water. Go, swift messengers, to a people tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers.
23Is 18:3 All you people of the world, you who live on the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it, and when a trumpet sounds, you will hear it.
23Is 18:4 This is what the LORD says to me£º "I will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest."
23Is 18:5 For, before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, and cut down and take away the spreading branches.
23Is 18:6 They will all be left to the mountain birds of prey and to the wild animals; the birds will feed on them all summer, the wild animals all winter.
23Is 18:7 At that time gifts will be brought to the LORD Almighty from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people feared far and wide, an aggressive nation of strange speech, whose land is divided by rivers--the gifts will be brought to Mount Zion, the place of the Name of the LORD Almighty.
23Is 19:1 An oracle concerning Egypt£º See, the LORD rides on a swift cloud and is coming to Egypt. The idols of Egypt tremble before him, and the hearts of the Egyptians melt within them.
23Is 19:2 "I will stir up Egyptian against Egyptian--brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
23Is 19:3 The Egyptians will lose heart, and I will bring their plans to nothing; they will consult the idols and the spirits of the dead, the mediums and the spiritists.
23Is 19:4 I will hand the Egyptians over to the power of a cruel master, and a fierce king will rule over them," declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.
23Is 19:5 The waters of the river will dry up, and the riverbed will be parched and dry.
23Is 19:6 The canals will stink; the streams of Egypt will dwindle and dry up. The reeds and rushes will wither,
23Is 19:7 also the plants along the Nile, at the mouth of the river. Every sown field along the Nile will become parched, will blow away and be no more.
23Is 19:8 The fishermen will groan and lament, all who cast hooks into the Nile; those who throw nets on the water will pine away.
23Is 19:9 Those who work with combed flax will despair, the weavers of fine linen will lose hope.
23Is 19:10 The workers in cloth will be dejected, and all the wage earners will be sick at heart.
23Is 19:11 The officials of Zoan are nothing but fools; the wise counselors of Pharaoh give senseless advice. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am one of the wise men, a disciple of the ancient kings"?
23Is 19:12 Where are your wise men now? Let them show you and make known what the LORD Almighty has planned against Egypt.
23Is 19:13 The officials of Zoan have become fools, the leaders of Memphis are deceived; the cornerstones of her peoples have led Egypt astray.
23Is 19:14 The LORD has poured into them a spirit of dizziness; they make Egypt stagger in all that she does, as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit.
23Is 19:15 There is nothing Egypt can do--head or tail, palm branch or reed.
23Is 19:16 In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the LORD Almighty raises against them.
23Is 19:17 And the land of Judah will bring terror to the Egyptians; everyone to whom Judah is mentioned will be terrified, because of what the LORD Almighty is planning against them.
23Is 19:18 In that day five cities in Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the LORD Almighty. One of them will be called the City of Destruction.
23Is 19:19 In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the LORD at its border.
23Is 19:20 It will be a sign and witness to the LORD Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them.
23Is 19:21 So the LORD will make himself known to the Egyptians, and in that day they will acknowledge the LORD. They will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings; they will make vows to the LORD and keep them.
23Is 19:22 The LORD will strike Egypt with a plague; he will strike them and heal them. They will turn to the LORD, and he will respond to their pleas and heal them.
23Is 19:23 In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together.
23Is 19:24 In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth.
23Is 19:25 The LORD Almighty will bless them, saying, "Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance."
23Is 20:1 In the year that the supreme commander, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and attacked and captured it--
23Is 20:2 at that time the LORD spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz. He said to him, "Take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet." And he did so, going around stripped and barefoot.
23Is 20:3 Then the LORD said, "Just as my servant Isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years, as a sign and portent against Egypt and Cush,
23Is 20:4 so the king of Assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the Egyptian captives and Cushite exiles, young and old, with buttocks bared--to Egypt's shame.
23Is 20:5 Those who trusted in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be afraid and put to shame.
23Is 20:6 In that day the people who live on this coast will say, 'See what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then can we escape?'"
23Is 21:1 An oracle concerning the Desert by the Sea£º Like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror.
23Is 21:2 A dire vision has been shown to me£º The traitor betrays, the looter takes loot. Elam, attack! Media, lay siege! I will bring to an end all the groaning she caused.
23Is 21:3 At this my body is racked with pain, pangs seize me, like those of a woman in labor; I am staggered by what I hear, I am bewildered by what I see.
23Is 21:4 My heart falters, fear makes me tremble; the twilight I longed for has become a horror to me.
23Is 21:5 They set the tables, they spread the rugs, they eat, they drink! Get up, you officers, oil the shields!
23Is 21:6 This is what the Lord says to me£º "Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.
23Is 21:7 When he sees chariots with teams of horses, riders on donkeys or riders on camels, let him be alert, fully alert."
23Is 21:8 And the lookout shouted, "Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; every night I stay at my post.
23Is 21:9 Look, here comes a man in a chariot with a team of horses. And he gives back the answer£º 'Babylon has fallen, has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground!'"
23Is 21:10 O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, I tell you what I have heard from the LORD Almighty, from the God of Israel.
23Is 21:11 An oracle concerning Dumah£º Someone calls to me from Seir, "Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?"
23Is 21:12 The watchman replies, "Morning is coming, but also the night. If you would ask, then ask; and come back yet again."
23Is 21:13 An oracle concerning Arabia£º You caravans of Dedanites, who camp in the thickets of Arabia,
23Is 21:14 bring water for the thirsty; you who live in Tema, bring food for the fugitives.
23Is 21:15 They flee from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow and from the heat of battle.
23Is 21:16 This is what the Lord says to me£º "Within one year, as a servant bound by contract would count it, all the pomp of Kedar will come to an end.
23Is 21:17 The survivors of the bowmen, the warriors of Kedar, will be few." The LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.
23Is 22:1 An oracle concerning the Valley of Vision£º What troubles you now, that you have all gone up on the roofs,
23Is 22:2 O town full of commotion, O city of tumult and revelry? Your slain were not killed by the sword, nor did they die in battle.
23Is 22:3 All your leaders have fled together; they have been captured without using the bow. All you who were caught were taken prisoner together, having fled while the enemy was still far away.
23Is 22:4 Therefore I said, "Turn away from me; let me weep bitterly. Do not try to console me over the destruction of my people."
23Is 22:5 The Lord, the LORD Almighty, has a day of tumult and trampling and terror in the Valley of Vision, a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains.
23Is 22:6 Elam takes up the quiver, with her charioteers and horses; Kir uncovers the shield.
23Is 22:7 Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the city gates;
23Is 22:8 the defenses of Judah are stripped away. And you looked in that day to the weapons in the Palace of the Forest;
23Is 22:9 you saw that the City of David had many breaches in its defenses; you stored up water in the Lower Pool.
23Is 22:10 You counted the buildings in Jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the wall.
23Is 22:11 You built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the Old Pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or have regard for the One who planned it long ago.
23Is 22:12 The Lord, the LORD Almighty, called you on that day to weep and to wail, to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth.
23Is 22:13 But see, there is joy and revelry, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine! "Let us eat and drink," you say, "for tomorrow we die!"
23Is 22:14 The LORD Almighty has revealed this in my hearing£º "Till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for," says the Lord, the LORD Almighty.
23Is 22:15 This is what the Lord, the LORD Almighty, says£º "Go, say to this steward, to Shebna, who is in charge of the palace£º
23Is 22:16 What are you doing here and who gave you permission to cut out a grave for yourself here, hewing your grave on the height and chiseling your resting place in the rock?
23Is 22:17 "Beware, the LORD is about to take firm hold of you and hurl you away, O you mighty man.
23Is 22:18 He will roll you up tightly like a ball and throw you into a large country. There you will die and there your splendid chariots will remain--you disgrace to your master's house!
23Is 22:19 I will depose you from your office, and you will be ousted from your position.
23Is 22:20 "In that day I will summon my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
23Is 22:21 I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to those who live in Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
23Is 22:22 I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.
23Is 22:23 I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will be a seat of honor for the house of his father.
23Is 22:24 All the glory of his family will hang on him£º its offspring and offshoots--all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.
23Is 22:25 "In that day," declares the LORD Almighty, "the peg driven into the firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut down." The LORD has spoken.
23Is 23:1 An oracle concerning Tyre£º Wail, O ships of Tarshish! For Tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor. From the land of Cyprus word has come to them.
23Is 23:2 Be silent, you people of the island and you merchants of Sidon, whom the seafarers have enriched.
23Is 23:3 On the great waters came the grain of the Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre, and she became the marketplace of the nations.
23Is 23:4 Be ashamed, O Sidon, and you, O fortress of the sea, for the sea has spoken£º "I have neither been in labor nor given birth; I have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters."
23Is 23:5 When word comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report from Tyre.
23Is 23:6 Cross over to Tarshish; wail, you people of the island.
23Is 23:7 Is this your city of revelry, the old, old city, whose feet have taken her to settle in far-off lands?
23Is 23:8 Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traders are renowned in the earth?
23Is 23:9 The LORD Almighty planned it, to bring low the pride of all glory and to humble all who are renowned on the earth.
23Is 23:10 Till your land as along the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish, for you no longer have a harbor.
23Is 23:11 The LORD has stretched out his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble. He has given an order concerning Phoenicia that her fortresses be destroyed.
23Is 23:12 He said, "No more of your reveling, O Virgin Daughter of Sidon, now crushed! "Up, cross over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest."
23Is 23:13 Look at the land of the Babylonians, this people that is now of no account! The Assyrians have made it a place for desert creatures; they raised up their siege towers, they stripped its fortresses bare and turned it into a ruin.
23Is 23:14 Wail, you ships of Tarshish; your fortress is destroyed!
23Is 23:15 At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the span of a king's life. But at the end of these seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute£º
23Is 23:16 "Take up a harp, walk through the city, O prostitute forgotten; play the harp well, sing many a song, so that you will be remembered."
23Is 23:17 At the end of seventy years, the LORD will deal with Tyre. She will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
23Is 23:18 Yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the LORD; they will not be stored up or hoarded. Her profits will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothes.
23Is 24:1 See, the LORD is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it; he will ruin its face and scatter its inhabitants--
23Is 24:2 it will be the same for priest as for people, for master as for servant, for mistress as for maid, for seller as for buyer, for borrower as for lender, for debtor as for creditor.
23Is 24:3 The earth will be completely laid waste and totally plundered. The LORD has spoken this word.
23Is 24:4 The earth dries up and withers, the world languishes and withers, the exalted of the earth languish.
23Is 24:5 The earth is defiled by its people; they have disobeyed the laws, violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant.
23Is 24:6 Therefore a curse consumes the earth; its people must bear their guilt. Therefore earth's inhabitants are burned up, and very few are left.
23Is 24:7 The new wine dries up and the vine withers; all the merrymakers groan.
23Is 24:8 The gaiety of the tambourines is stilled, the noise of the revelers has stopped, the joyful harp is silent.
23Is 24:9 No longer do they drink wine with a song; the beer is bitter to its drinkers.
23Is 24:10 The ruined city lies desolate; the entrance to every house is barred.
23Is 24:11 In the streets they cry out for wine; all joy turns to gloom, all gaiety is banished from the earth.
23Is 24:12 The city is left in ruins, its gate is battered to pieces.
23Is 24:13 So will it be on the earth and among the nations, as when an olive tree is beaten, or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest.
23Is 24:14 They raise their voices, they shout for joy; from the west they acclaim the LORD'S majesty.
23Is 24:15 Therefore in the east give glory to the LORD; exalt the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, in the islands of the sea.
23Is 24:16 From the ends of the earth we hear singing£º "Glory to the Righteous One." But I said, "I waste away, I waste away! Woe to me! The treacherous betray! With treachery the treacherous betray!"
23Is 24:17 Terror and pit and snare await you, O people of the earth.
23Is 24:18 Whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit; whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare. The floodgates of the heavens are opened, the foundations of the earth shake.
23Is 24:19 The earth is broken up, the earth is split asunder, the earth is thoroughly shaken.
23Is 24:20 The earth reels like a drunkard, it sways like a hut in the wind; so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it falls--never to rise again.
23Is 24:21 In that day the LORD will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below.
23Is 24:22 They will be herded together like prisoners bound in a dungeon; they will be shut up in prison and be punished after many days.
23Is 24:23 The moon will be abashed, the sun ashamed; for the LORD Almighty will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before its elders, gloriously.
23Is 25:1 O LORD, you are my God; I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness you have done marvelous things, things planned long ago.
23Is 25:2 You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin, the foreigners' stronghold a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.
23Is 25:3 Therefore strong peoples will honor you; cities of ruthless nations will revere you.
23Is 25:4 You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge for the needy in his distress, a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall
23Is 25:5 and like the heat of the desert. You silence the uproar of foreigners; as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud, so the song of the ruthless is stilled.
23Is 25:6 On this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine--the best of meats and the finest of wines.
23Is 25:7 On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations;
23Is 25:8 he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from all faces; he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth. The LORD has spoken.
23Is 25:9 In that day they will say, "Surely this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the LORD, we trusted in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation."
23Is 25:10 The hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain; but Moab will be trampled under him as straw is trampled down in the manure.
23Is 25:11 They will spread out their hands in it, as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim. God will bring down their pride despite the cleverness of their hands.
23Is 25:12 He will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low; he will bring them down to the ground, to the very dust.
23Is 26:1 In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah£º We have a strong city; God makes salvation its walls and ramparts.
23Is 26:2 Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter, the nation that keeps faith.
23Is 26:3 You will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast, because he trusts in you.
23Is 26:4 Trust in the LORD forever, for the LORD, the LORD, is the Rock eternal.
23Is 26:5 He humbles those who dwell on high, he lays the lofty city low; he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust.
23Is 26:6 Feet trample it down--the feet of the oppressed, the footsteps of the poor.
23Is 26:7 The path of the righteous is level; O upright One, you make the way of the righteous smooth.
23Is 26:8 Yes, LORD, walking in the way of your laws, we wait for you; your name and renown are the desire of our hearts.
23Is 26:9 My soul yearns for you in the night; in the morning my spirit longs for you. When your judgments come upon the earth, the people of the world learn righteousness.
23Is 26:10 Though grace is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and regard not the majesty of the LORD.
23Is 26:11 O LORD, your hand is lifted high, but they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame; let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.
23Is 26:12 LORD, you establish peace for us; all that we have accomplished you have done for us.
23Is 26:13 O LORD, our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone do we honor.
23Is 26:14 They are now dead, they live no more; those departed spirits do not rise. You punished them and brought them to ruin; you wiped out all memory of them.
23Is 26:15 You have enlarged the nation, O LORD; you have enlarged the nation. You have gained glory for yourself; you have extended all the borders of the land.
23Is 26:16 LORD, they came to you in their distress; when you disciplined them, they could barely whisper a prayer.
23Is 26:17 As a woman with child and about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain, so were we in your presence, O LORD.
23Is 26:18 We were with child, we writhed in pain, but we gave birth to wind. We have not brought salvation to the earth; we have not given birth to people of the world.
23Is 26:19 But your dead will live; their bodies will rise. You who dwell in the dust, wake up and shout for joy. Your dew is like the dew of the morning; the earth will give birth to her dead.
23Is 26:20 Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you; hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by.
23Is 26:21 See, the LORD is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will disclose the blood shed upon her; she will conceal her slain no longer.
23Is 27:1 In that day, the LORD will punish with his sword, his fierce, great and powerful sword, Leviathan the gliding serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will slay the monster of the sea.
23Is 27:2 In that day--"Sing about a fruitful vineyard£º
23Is 27:3 I, the LORD, watch over it; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one may harm it.
23Is 27:4 I am not angry. If only there were briers and thorns confronting me! I would march against them in battle; I would set them all on fire.
23Is 27:5 Or else let them come to me for refuge; let them make peace with me, yes, let them make peace with me."
23Is 27:6 In days to come Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit.
23Is 27:7 Has the LORD struck her as he struck down those who struck her? Has she been killed as those were killed who killed her?
23Is 27:8 By warfare and exile you contend with her--with his fierce blast he drives her out, as on a day the east wind blows.
23Is 27:9 By this, then, will Jacob's guilt be atoned for, and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin£º When he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces, no Asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing.
23Is 27:10 The fortified city stands desolate, an abandoned settlement, forsaken like the desert; there the calves graze, there they lie down; they strip its branches bare.
23Is 27:11 When its twigs are dry, they are broken off and women come and make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.
23Is 27:12 In that day the LORD will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the Wadi of Egypt, and you, O Israelites, will be gathered up one by one.
23Is 27:13 And in that day a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the LORD on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
23Is 28:1 Woe to that wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, to the fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley--to that city, the pride of those laid low by wine!
23Is 28:2 See, the Lord has one who is powerful and strong. Like a hailstorm and a destructive wind, like a driving rain and a flooding downpour, he will throw it forcefully to the ground.
23Is 28:3 That wreath, the pride of Ephraim's drunkards, will be trampled underfoot.
23Is 28:4 That fading flower, his glorious beauty, set on the head of a fertile valley, will be like a fig ripe before harvest--as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand, he swallows it.
23Is 28:5 In that day the LORD Almighty will be a glorious crown, a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people.
23Is 28:6 He will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment, a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.
23Is 28:7 And these also stagger from wine and reel from beer£º Priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine; they reel from beer, they stagger when seeing visions, they stumble when rendering decisions.
23Is 28:8 All the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth.
23Is 28:9 "Who is it he is trying to teach? To whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to those just taken from the breast?
23Is 28:10 For it is£º Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there."
23Is 28:11 Very well then, with foreign lips and strange tongues God will speak to this people,
23Is 28:12 to whom he said, "This is the resting place, let the weary rest"; and, "This is the place of repose"--but they would not listen.
23Is 28:13 So then, the word of the LORD to them will become£º Do and do, do and do, rule on rule, rule on rule; a little here, a little there--so that they will go and fall backward, be injured and snared and captured.
23Is 28:14 Therefore hear the word of the LORD, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.
23Is 28:15 You boast, "We have entered into a covenant with death, with the grave we have made an agreement. When an overwhelming scourge sweeps by, it cannot touch us, for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood our hiding place."
23Is 28:16 So this is what the Sovereign LORD says£º "See, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who trusts will never be dismayed.
23Is 28:17 I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away your refuge, the lie, and water will overflow your hiding place.
23Is 28:18 Your covenant with death will be annulled; your agreement with the grave will not stand. When the overwhelming scourge sweeps by, you will be beaten down by it.
23Is 28:19 As often as it comes it will carry you away; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through." The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.
23Is 28:20 The bed is too short to stretch out on, the blanket too narrow to wrap around you.
23Is 28:21 The LORD will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon--to do his work, his strange work, and perform his task, his alien task.
23Is 28:22 Now stop your mocking, or your chains will become heavier; the Lord, the LORD Almighty, has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land.
23Is 28:23 Listen and hear my voice; pay attention and hear what I say.
23Is 28:24 When a farmer plows for planting, does he plow continually? Does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil?
23Is 28:25 When he has leveled the surface, does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin? Does he not plant wheat in its place, barley in its plot, and spelt in its field?
23Is 28:26 His God instructs him and teaches him the right way.
23Is 28:27 Caraway is not threshed with a sledge, nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin; caraway is beaten out with a rod, and cummin with a stick.
23Is 28:28 Grain must be ground to make bread; so one does not go on threshing it forever. Though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it, his horses do not grind it.
23Is 28:29 All this also comes from the LORD Almighty, wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom.
23Is 29:1 Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David settled! Add year to year and let your cycle of festivals go on.
23Is 29:2 Yet I will besiege Ariel; she will mourn and lament, she will be to me like an altar hearth.
23Is 29:3 I will encamp against you all around; I will encircle you with towers and set up my siege works against you.
23Is 29:4 Brought low, you will speak from the ground; your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will come ghostlike from the earth; out of the dust your speech will whisper.
23Is 29:5 But your many enemies will become like fine dust, the ruthless hordes like blown chaff. Suddenly, in an instant,
23Is 29:6 the LORD Almighty will come with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire.
23Is 29:7 Then the hordes of all the nations that fight against Ariel, that attack her and her fortress and besiege her, will be as it is with a dream, with a vision in the night--
23Is 29:8 as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating, but he awakens, and his hunger remains; as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking, but he awakens faint, with his thirst unquenched. So will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion.
23Is 29:9 Be stunned and amazed, blind yourselves and be sightless; be drunk, but not from wine, stagger, but not from beer.
23Is 29:10 The LORD has brought over you a deep sleep£º He has sealed your eyes (the prophets); he has covered your heads (the seers).
23Is 29:11 For you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll. And if you give the scroll to someone who can read, and say to him, "Read this, please," he will answer, "I can't; it is sealed."
23Is 29:12 Or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read, and say, "Read this, please," he will answer, "I don't know how to read."
23Is 29:13 The Lord says£º "These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men.
23Is 29:14 Therefore once more I will astound these people with wonder upon wonder; the wisdom of the wise will perish, the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish."
23Is 29:15 Woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the LORD, who do their work in darkness and think, "Who sees us? Who will know?"
23Is 29:16 You turn things upside down, as if the potter were thought to be like the clay! Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, "He did not make me"? Can the pot say of the potter, "He knows nothing"?
23Is 29:17 In a very short time, will not Lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest?
23Is 29:18 In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.
23Is 29:19 Once more the humble will rejoice in the LORD; the needy will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 29:20 The ruthless will vanish, the mockers will disappear, and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down--
23Is 29:21 those who with a word make a man out to be guilty, who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice.
23Is 29:22 Therefore this is what the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, says to the house of Jacob£º "No longer will Jacob be ashamed; no longer will their faces grow pale.
23Is 29:23 When they see among them their children, the work of my hands, they will keep my name holy; they will acknowledge the holiness of the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.
23Is 29:24 Those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding; those who complain will accept instruction."
23Is 30:1 "Woe to the obstinate children," declares the LORD, "to those who carry out plans that are not mine, forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit, heaping sin upon sin;
23Is 30:2 who go down to Egypt without consulting me; who look for help to Pharaoh's protection, to Egypt's shade for refuge.
23Is 30:3 But Pharaoh's protection will be to your shame, Egypt's shade will bring you disgrace.
23Is 30:4 Though they have officials in Zoan and their envoys have arrived in Hanes,
23Is 30:5 everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them, who bring neither help nor advantage, but only shame and disgrace."
23Is 30:6 An oracle concerning the animals of the Negev£º Through a land of hardship and distress, of lions and lionesses, of adders and darting snakes, the envoys carry their riches on donkeys' backs, their treasures on the humps of camels, to that unprofitable nation,
23Is 30:7 to Egypt, whose help is utterly useless. Therefore I call her Rahab the Do-Nothing.
23Is 30:8 Go now, write it on a tablet for them, inscribe it on a scroll, that for the days to come it may be an everlasting witness.
23Is 30:9 These are rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to the LORD'S instruction.
23Is 30:10 They say to the seers, "See no more visions!" and to the prophets, "Give us no more visions of what is right! Tell us pleasant things, prophesy illusions.
23Is 30:11 Leave this way, get off this path, and stop confronting us with the Holy One of Israel!"
23Is 30:12 Therefore, this is what the Holy One of Israel says£º "Because you have rejected this message, relied on oppression and depended on deceit,
23Is 30:13 this sin will become for you like a high wall, cracked and bulging, that collapses suddenly, in an instant.
23Is 30:14 It will break in pieces like pottery, shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern."
23Is 30:15 This is what the Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says£º "In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you would have none of it.
23Is 30:16 You said, 'No, we will flee on horses.' Therefore you will flee! You said, 'We will ride off on swift horses.' Therefore your pursuers will be swift!
23Is 30:17 A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee away, till you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill."
23Is 30:18 Yet the LORD longs to be gracious to you; he rises to show you compassion. For the LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him!
23Is 30:19 O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you.
23Is 30:20 Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your teachers will be hidden no more; with your own eyes you will see them.
23Is 30:21 Whether you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, "This is the way; walk in it."
23Is 30:22 Then you will defile your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them, "Away with you!"
23Is 30:23 He will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. In that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows.
23Is 30:24 The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash, spread out with fork and shovel.
23Is 30:25 In the day of great slaughter, when the towers fall, streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill.
23Is 30:26 The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted.
23Is 30:27 See, the Name of the LORD comes from afar, with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke; his lips are full of wrath, and his tongue is a consuming fire.
23Is 30:28 His breath is like a rushing torrent, rising up to the neck. He shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction; he places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray.
23Is 30:29 And you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people go up with flutes to the mountain of the LORD, to the Rock of Israel.
23Is 30:30 The LORD will cause men to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm and hail.
23Is 30:31 The voice of the LORD will shatter Assyria; with his scepter he will strike them down.
23Is 30:32 Every stroke the LORD lays on them with his punishing rod will be to the music of tambourines and harps, as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm.
23Is 30:33 Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king. Its fire pit has been made deep and wide, with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze.
23Is 31:1 Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in the multitude of their chariots and in the great strength of their horsemen, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel, or seek help from the LORD.
23Is 31:2 Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster; he does not take back his words. He will rise up against the house of the wicked, against those who help evildoers.
23Is 31:3 But the Egyptians are men and not God; their horses are flesh and not spirit. When the LORD stretches out his hand, he who helps will stumble, he who is helped will fall; both will perish together.
23Is 31:4 This is what the LORD says to me£º "As a lion growls, a great lion over his prey--and though a whole band of shepherds is called together against him, he is not frightened by their shouts or disturbed by their clamor--so the LORD Almighty will come down to do battle on Mount Zion and on its heights.
23Is 31:5 Like birds hovering overhead, the LORD Almighty will shield Jerusalem; he will shield it and deliver it, he will 'pass over' it and will rescue it."
23Is 31:6 Return to him you have so greatly revolted against, O Israelites.
23Is 31:7 For in that day every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold your sinful hands have made.
23Is 31:8 "Assyria will fall by a sword that is not of man; a sword, not of mortals, will devour them. They will flee before the sword and their young men will be put to forced labor.
23Is 31:9 Their stronghold will fall because of terror; at sight of the battle standard their commanders will panic," declares the LORD, whose fire is in Zion, whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
23Is 32:1 See, a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice.
23Is 32:2 Each man will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.
23Is 32:3 Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.
23Is 32:4 The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear.
23Is 32:5 No longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected.
23Is 32:6 For the fool speaks folly, his mind is busy with evil£º He practices ungodliness and spreads error concerning the LORD; the hungry he leaves empty and from the thirsty he withholds water.
23Is 32:7 The scoundrel's methods are wicked, he makes up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.
23Is 32:8 But the noble man makes noble plans, and by noble deeds he stands.
23Is 32:9 You women who are so complacent, rise up and listen to me; you daughters who feel secure, hear what I have to say!
23Is 32:10 In little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble; the grape harvest will fail, and the harvest of fruit will not come.
23Is 32:11 Tremble, you complacent women; shudder, you daughters who feel secure! Strip off your clothes, put sackcloth around your waists.
23Is 32:12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines
23Is 32:13 and for the land of my people, a land overgrown with thorns and briers--yes, mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry.
23Is 32:14 The fortress will be abandoned, the noisy city deserted; citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever, the delight of donkeys, a pasture for flocks,
23Is 32:15 till the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the desert becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field seems like a forest.
23Is 32:16 Justice will dwell in the desert and righteousness live in the fertile field.
23Is 32:17 The fruit of righteousness will be peace; the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever.
23Is 32:18 My people will live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest.
23Is 32:19 Though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely,
23Is 32:20 how blessed you will be, sowing your seed by every stream, and letting your cattle and donkeys range free.
23Is 33:1 Woe to you, O destroyer, you who have not been destroyed! Woe to you, O traitor, you who have not been betrayed! When you stop destroying, you will be destroyed; when you stop betraying, you will be betrayed.
23Is 33:2 O LORD, be gracious to us; we long for you. Be our strength every morning, our salvation in time of distress.
23Is 33:3 At the thunder of your voice, the peoples flee; when you rise up, the nations scatter.
23Is 33:4 Your plunder, O nations, is harvested as by young locusts; like a swarm of locusts men pounce on it.
23Is 33:5 The LORD is exalted, for he dwells on high; he will fill Zion with justice and righteousness.
23Is 33:6 He will be the sure foundation for your times, a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the LORD is the key to this treasure.
23Is 33:7 Look, their brave men cry aloud in the streets; the envoys of peace weep bitterly.
23Is 33:8 The highways are deserted, no travelers are on the roads. The treaty is broken, its witnesses are despised, no one is respected.
23Is 33:9 The land mourns and wastes away, Lebanon is ashamed and withers; Sharon is like the Arabah, and Bashan and Carmel drop their leaves.
23Is 33:10 "Now will I arise," says the LORD. "Now will I be exalted; now will I be lifted up.
23Is 33:11 You conceive chaff, you give birth to straw; your breath is a fire that consumes you.
23Is 33:12 The peoples will be burned as if to lime; like cut thornbushes they will be set ablaze."
23Is 33:13 You who are far away, hear what I have done; you who are near, acknowledge my power!
23Is 33:14 The sinners in Zion are terrified; trembling grips the godless£º "Who of us can dwell with the consuming fire? Who of us can dwell with everlasting burning?"
23Is 33:15 He who walks righteously and speaks what is right, who rejects gain from extortion and keeps his hand from accepting bribes, who stops his ears against plots of murder and shuts his eyes against contemplating evil--
23Is 33:16 this is the man who will dwell on the heights, whose refuge will be the mountain fortress. His bread will be supplied, and water will not fail him.
23Is 33:17 Your eyes will see the king in his beauty and view a land that stretches afar.
23Is 33:18 In your thoughts you will ponder the former terror£º "Where is that chief officer? Where is the one who took the revenue? Where is the officer in charge of the towers?"
23Is 33:19 You will see those arrogant people no more, those people of an obscure speech, with their strange, incomprehensible tongue.
23Is 33:20 Look upon Zion, the city of our festivals; your eyes will see Jerusalem, a peaceful abode, a tent that will not be moved; its stakes will never be pulled up, nor any of its ropes broken.
23Is 33:21 There the LORD will be our Mighty One. It will be like a place of broad rivers and streams. No galley with oars will ride them, no mighty ship will sail them.
23Is 33:22 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; it is he who will save us.
23Is 33:23 Your rigging hangs loose£º The mast is not held secure, the sail is not spread. Then an abundance of spoils will be divided and even the lame will carry off plunder.
23Is 33:24 No one living in Zion will say, "I am ill"; and the sins of those who dwell there will be forgiven.
23Is 34:1 Come near, you nations, and listen; pay attention, you peoples! Let the earth hear, and all that is in it, the world, and all that comes out of it!
23Is 34:2 The LORD is angry with all nations; his wrath is upon all their armies. He will totally destroy them, he will give them over to slaughter.
23Is 34:3 Their slain will be thrown out, their dead bodies will send up a stench; the mountains will be soaked with their blood.
23Is 34:4 All the stars of the heavens will be dissolved and the sky rolled up like a scroll; all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine, like shriveled figs from the fig tree.
23Is 34:5 My sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; see, it descends in judgment on Edom, the people I have totally destroyed.
23Is 34:6 The sword of the LORD is bathed in blood, it is covered with fat--the blood of lambs and goats, fat from the kidneys of rams. For the LORD has a sacrifice in Bozrah and a great slaughter in Edom.
23Is 34:7 And the wild oxen will fall with them, the bull calves and the great bulls. Their land will be drenched with blood, and the dust will be soaked with fat.
23Is 34:8 For the LORD has a day of vengeance, a year of retribution, to uphold Zion's cause.
23Is 34:9 Edom's streams will be turned into pitch, her dust into burning sulfur; her land will become blazing pitch!
23Is 34:10 It will not be quenched night and day; its smoke will rise forever. From generation to generation it will lie desolate; no one will ever pass through it again.
23Is 34:11 The desert owl and screech owl will possess it; the great owl and the raven will nest there. God will stretch out over Edom the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation.
23Is 34:12 Her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom, all her princes will vanish away.
23Is 34:13 Thorns will overrun her citadels, nettles and brambles her strongholds. She will become a haunt for jackals, a home for owls.
23Is 34:14 Desert creatures will meet with hyenas, and wild goats will bleat to each other; there the night creatures will also repose and find for themselves places of rest.
23Is 34:15 The owl will nest there and lay eggs, she will hatch them, and care for her young under the shadow of her wings; there also the falcons will gather, each with its mate.
23Is 34:16 Look in the scroll of the LORD and read£º None of these will be missing, not one will lack her mate. For it is his mouth that has given the order, and his Spirit will gather them together.
23Is 34:17 He allots their portions; his hand distributes them by measure. They will possess it forever and dwell there from generation to generation.
23Is 35:1 The desert and the parched land will be glad; the wilderness will rejoice and blossom. Like the crocus,
23Is 35:2 it will burst into bloom; it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of the LORD, the splendor of our God.
23Is 35:3 Strengthen the feeble hands, steady the knees that give way;
23Is 35:4 say to those with fearful hearts, "Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you."
23Is 35:5 Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
23Is 35:6 Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy. Water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert.
23Is 35:7 The burning sand will become a pool, the thirsty ground bubbling springs. In the haunts where jackals once lay, grass and reeds and papyrus will grow.
23Is 35:8 And a highway will be there; it will be called the Way of Holiness. The unclean will not journey on it; it will be for those who walk in that Way; wicked fools will not go about on it.
23Is 35:9 No lion will be there, nor will any ferocious beast get up on it; they will not be found there. But only the redeemed will walk there,
23Is 35:10 and the ransomed of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
23Is 36:1 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
23Is 36:2 Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Washerman's Field,
23Is 36:3 Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him.
23Is 36:4 The field commander said to them, "Tell Hezekiah, "'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says£º On what are you basing this confidence of yours?
23Is 36:5 You say you have strategy and military strength--but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me?
23Is 36:6 Look now, you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces a man's hand and wounds him if he leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him.
23Is 36:7 And if you say to me, "We are depending on the LORD our God"--isn't he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, "You must worship before this altar"?
23Is 36:8 "'Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria£º I will give you two thousand horses--if you can put riders on them!
23Is 36:9 How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master's officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
23Is 36:10 Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the LORD? The LORD himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.'"
23Is 36:11 Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don't speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall."
23Is 36:12 But the commander replied, "Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the men sitting on the wall--who, like you, will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine?"
23Is 36:13 Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, "Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!
23Is 36:14 This is what the king says£º Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you!
23Is 36:15 Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, 'The LORD will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.'
23Is 36:16 "Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says£º Make peace with me and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,
23Is 36:17 until I come and take you to a land like your own--a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
23Is 36:18 "Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, 'The LORD will deliver us.' Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
23Is 36:19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
23Is 36:20 Who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?"
23Is 36:21 But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, "Do not answer him."
23Is 36:22 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said.
23Is 37:1 When King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the LORD.
23Is 37:2 He sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
23Is 37:3 They told him, "This is what Hezekiah says£º This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.
23Is 37:4 It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to ridicule the living God, and that he will rebuke him for the words the LORD your God has heard. Therefore pray for the remnant that still survives."
23Is 37:5 When King Hezekiah's officials came to Isaiah,
23Is 37:6 Isaiah said to them, "Tell your master, 'This is what the LORD says£º Do not be afraid of what you have heard--those words with which the underlings of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.
23Is 37:7 Listen! I am going to put a spirit in him so that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own country, and there I will have him cut down with the sword.'"
23Is 37:8 When the field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish, he withdrew and found the king fighting against Libnah.
23Is 37:9 Now Sennacherib received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt, was marching out to fight against him. When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah with this word£º
23Is 37:10 "Say to Hezekiah king of Judah£º Do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says, 'Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
23Is 37:11 Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries, destroying them completely. And will you be delivered?
23Is 37:12 Did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them--the gods of Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the people of Eden who were in Tel Assar?
23Is 37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena or Ivvah?"
23Is 37:14 Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the temple of the LORD and spread it out before the LORD.
23Is 37:15 And Hezekiah prayed to the LORD£º
23Is 37:16 "O LORD Almighty, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.
23Is 37:17 Give ear, O LORD, and hear; open your eyes, O LORD, and see; listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to insult the living God.
23Is 37:18 "It is true, O LORD, that the Assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands.
23Is 37:19 They have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them, for they were not gods but only wood and stone, fashioned by human hands.
23Is 37:20 Now, O LORD our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone, O LORD, are God."
23Is 37:21 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah£º "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
23Is 37:22 this is the word the LORD has spoken against him£º "The Virgin Daughter of Zion despises and mocks you. The Daughter of Jerusalem tosses her head as you flee.
23Is 37:23 Who is it you have insulted and blasphemed? Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!
23Is 37:24 By your messengers you have heaped insults on the Lord. And you have said, 'With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, the utmost heights of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, the choicest of its pines. I have reached its remotest heights, the finest of its forests.
23Is 37:25 I have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there. With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.'
23Is 37:26 "Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone.
23Is 37:27 Their people, drained of power, are dismayed and put to shame. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass sprouting on the roof, scorched before it grows up.
23Is 37:28 "But I know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me.
23Is 37:29 Because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth, and I will make you return by the way you came.
23Is 37:30 "This will be the sign for you, O Hezekiah£º "This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23Is 37:31 Once more a remnant of the house of Judah will take root below and bear fruit above.
23Is 37:32 For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the LORD Almighty will accomplish this.
23Is 37:33 "Therefore this is what the LORD says concerning the king of Assyria£º "He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here. He will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it.
23Is 37:34 By the way that he came he will return; he will not enter this city," declares the LORD.
23Is 37:35 "I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!"
23Is 37:36 Then the angel of the LORD went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning--there were all the dead bodies!
23Is 37:37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there.
23Is 37:38 One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer cut him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king.
23Is 38:1 In those days Hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to him and said, "This is what the LORD says£º Put your house in order, because you are going to die; you will not recover."
23Is 38:2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
23Is 38:3 "Remember, O LORD, how I have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes." And Hezekiah wept bitterly.
23Is 38:4 Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah£º
23Is 38:5 "Go and tell Hezekiah, 'This is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says£º I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life.
23Is 38:6 And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.
23Is 38:7 "'This is the LORD'S sign to you that the LORD will do what he has promised£º
23Is 38:8 I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.'" So the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down.
23Is 38:9 A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery£º
23Is 38:10 I said, "In the prime of my life must I go through the gates of death and be robbed of the rest of my years?"
23Is 38:11 I said, "I will not again see the LORD, the LORD, in the land of the living; no longer will I look on mankind, or be with those who now dwell in this world.
23Is 38:12 Like a shepherd's tent my house has been pulled down and taken from me. Like a weaver I have rolled up my life, and he has cut me off from the loom; day and night you made an end of me.
23Is 38:13 I waited patiently till dawn, but like a lion he broke all my bones; day and night you made an end of me.
23Is 38:14 I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned like a mourning dove. My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am troubled; O Lord, come to my aid!"
23Is 38:15 But what can I say? He has spoken to me, and he himself has done this. I will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of my soul.
23Is 38:16 Lord, by such things men live; and my spirit finds life in them too. You restored me to health and let me live.
23Is 38:17 Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such anguish. In your love you kept me from the pit of destruction; you have put all my sins behind your back.
23Is 38:18 For the grave cannot praise you, death cannot sing your praise; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.
23Is 38:19 The living, the living--they praise you, as I am doing today; fathers tell their children about your faithfulness.
23Is 38:20 The LORD will save me, and we will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the temple of the LORD.
23Is 38:21 Isaiah had said, "Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover."
23Is 38:22 Hezekiah had asked, "What will be the sign that I will go up to the temple of the LORD?"
23Is 39:1 At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan king of Babylon sent Hezekiah letters and a gift, because he had heard of his illness and recovery.
23Is 39:2 Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses--the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine oil, his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
23Is 39:3 Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, "What did those men say, and where did they come from?" "From a distant land," Hezekiah replied. "They came to me from Babylon."
23Is 39:4 The prophet asked, "What did they see in your palace?" "They saw everything in my palace," Hezekiah said. "There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them."
23Is 39:5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the LORD Almighty£º
23Is 39:6 The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your fathers have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.
23Is 39:7 And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon."
23Is 39:8 "The word of the LORD you have spoken is good," Hezekiah replied. For he thought, "There will be peace and security in my lifetime."
23Is 40:1 Comfort, comfort my people, says your God.
23Is 40:2 Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed, that her sin has been paid for, that she has received from the LORD'S hand double for all her sins.
23Is 40:3 A voice of one calling£º "In the desert prepare the way for the LORD; make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God.
23Is 40:4 Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain.
23Is 40:5 And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all mankind together will see it. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
23Is 40:6 A voice says, "Cry out." And I said, "What shall I cry?" "All men are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field.
23Is 40:7 The grass withers and the flowers fall, because the breath of the LORD blows on them. Surely the people are grass.
23Is 40:8 The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever."
23Is 40:9 You who bring good tidings to Zion, go up on a high mountain. You who bring good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with a shout, lift it up, do not be afraid; say to the towns of Judah, "Here is your God!"
23Is 40:10 See, the Sovereign LORD comes with power, and his arm rules for him. See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.
23Is 40:11 He tends his flock like a shepherd£º He gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart; he gently leads those that have young.
23Is 40:12 Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens? Who has held the dust of the earth in a basket, or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance?
23Is 40:13 Who has understood the mind of the LORD, or instructed him as his counselor?
23Is 40:14 Whom did the LORD consult to enlighten him, and who taught him the right way? Who was it that taught him knowledge or showed him the path of understanding?
23Is 40:15 Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are regarded as dust on the scales; he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust.
23Is 40:16 Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires, nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.
23Is 40:17 Before him all the nations are as nothing; they are regarded by him as worthless and less than nothing.
23Is 40:18 To whom, then, will you compare God? What image will you compare him to?
23Is 40:19 As for an idol, a craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it.
23Is 40:20 A man too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot. He looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple.
23Is 40:21 Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the earth was founded?
23Is 40:22 He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
23Is 40:23 He brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.
23Is 40:24 No sooner are they planted, no sooner are they sown, no sooner do they take root in the ground, than he blows on them and they wither, and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff.
23Is 40:25 "To whom will you compare me? Or who is my equal?" says the Holy One.
23Is 40:26 Lift your eyes and look to the heavens£º Who created all these? He who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name. Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.
23Is 40:27 Why do you say, O Jacob, and complain, O Israel, "My way is hidden from the LORD; my cause is disregarded by my God"?
23Is 40:28 Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.
23Is 40:29 He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.
23Is 40:30 Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall;
23Is 40:31 but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.
23Is 41:1 "Be silent before me, you islands! Let the nations renew their strength! Let them come forward and speak; let us meet together at the place of judgment.
23Is 41:2 "Who has stirred up one from the east, calling him in righteousness to his service? He hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him. He turns them to dust with his sword, to windblown chaff with his bow.
23Is 41:3 He pursues them and moves on unscathed, by a path his feet have not traveled before.
23Is 41:4 Who has done this and carried it through, calling forth the generations from the beginning? I, the LORD--with the first of them and with the last--I am he."
23Is 41:5 The islands have seen it and fear; the ends of the earth tremble. They approach and come forward;
23Is 41:6 each helps the other and says to his brother, "Be strong!"
23Is 41:7 The craftsman encourages the goldsmith, and he who smooths with the hammer spurs on him who strikes the anvil. He says of the welding, "It is good." He nails down the idol so it will not topple.
23Is 41:8 "But you, O Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, you descendants of Abraham my friend,
23Is 41:9 I took you from the ends of the earth, from its farthest corners I called you. I said, 'You are my servant'; I have chosen you and have not rejected you.
23Is 41:10 So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
23Is 41:11 "All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced; those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish.
23Is 41:12 Though you search for your enemies, you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all.
23Is 41:13 For I am the LORD, your God, who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you.
23Is 41:14 Do not be afraid, O worm Jacob, O little Israel, for I myself will help you," declares the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 41:15 "See, I will make you into a threshing sledge, new and sharp, with many teeth. You will thresh the mountains and crush them, and reduce the hills to chaff.
23Is 41:16 You will winnow them, the wind will pick them up, and a gale will blow them away. But you will rejoice in the LORD and glory in the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 41:17 "The poor and needy search for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. But I the LORD will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.
23Is 41:18 I will make rivers flow on barren heights, and springs within the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water, and the parched ground into springs.
23Is 41:19 I will put in the desert the cedar and the acacia, the myrtle and the olive. I will set pines in the wasteland, the fir and the cypress together,
23Is 41:20 so that people may see and know, may consider and understand, that the hand of the LORD has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it.
23Is 41:21 "Present your case," says the LORD. "Set forth your arguments," says Jacob's King.
23Is 41:22 "Bring in your idols to tell us what is going to happen. Tell us what the former things were, so that we may consider them and know their final outcome. Or declare to us the things to come,
23Is 41:23 tell us what the future holds, so we may know that you are gods. Do something, whether good or bad, so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear.
23Is 41:24 But you are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless; he who chooses you is detestable.
23Is 41:25 "I have stirred up one from the north, and he comes--one from the rising sun who calls on my name. He treads on rulers as if they were mortar, as if he were a potter treading the clay.
23Is 41:26 Who told of this from the beginning, so we could know, or beforehand, so we could say, 'He was right'? No one told of this, no one foretold it, no one heard any words from you.
23Is 41:27 I was the first to tell Zion, 'Look, here they are!' I gave to Jerusalem a messenger of good tidings.
23Is 41:28 I look but there is no one--no one among them to give counsel, no one to give answer when I ask them.
23Is 41:29 See, they are all false! Their deeds amount to nothing; their images are but wind and confusion.
23Is 42:1 "Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations.
23Is 42:2 He will not shout or cry out, or raise his voice in the streets.
23Is 42:3 A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out. In faithfulness he will bring forth justice;
23Is 42:4 he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth. In his law the islands will put their hope."
23Is 42:5 This is what God the LORD says--he who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and all that comes out of it, who gives breath to its people, and life to those who walk on it£º
23Is 42:6 "I, the LORD, have called you in righteousness; I will take hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the Gentiles,
23Is 42:7 to open eyes that are blind, to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness.
23Is 42:8 "I am the LORD; that is my name! I will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols.
23Is 42:9 See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce them to you."
23Is 42:10 Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live in them.
23Is 42:11 Let the desert and its towns raise their voices; let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops.
23Is 42:12 Let them give glory to the LORD and proclaim his praise in the islands.
23Is 42:13 The LORD will march out like a mighty man, like a warrior he will stir up his zeal; with a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies.
23Is 42:14 "For a long time I have kept silent, I have been quiet and held myself back. But now, like a woman in childbirth, I cry out, I gasp and pant.
23Is 42:15 I will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools.
23Is 42:16 I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them; I will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do; I will not forsake them.
23Is 42:17 But those who trust in idols, who say to images, 'You are our gods,' will be turned back in utter shame.
23Is 42:18 "Hear, you deaf; look, you blind, and see!
23Is 42:19 Who is blind but my servant, and deaf like the messenger I send? Who is blind like the one committed to me, blind like the servant of the LORD?
23Is 42:20 You have seen many things, but have paid no attention; your ears are open, but you hear nothing."
23Is 42:21 It pleased the LORD for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious.
23Is 42:22 But this is a people plundered and looted, all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, "Send them back."
23Is 42:23 Which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come?
23Is 42:24 Who handed Jacob over to become loot, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the LORD, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways; they did not obey his law.
23Is 42:25 So he poured out on them his burning anger, the violence of war. It enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they did not take it to heart.
23Is 43:1 But now, this is what the LORD says--he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed you, O Israel£º "Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine.
23Is 43:2 When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.
23Is 43:3 For I am the LORD, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I give Egypt for your ransom, Cush and Seba in your stead.
23Is 43:4 Since you are precious and honored in my sight, and because I love you, I will give men in exchange for you, and people in exchange for your life.
23Is 43:5 Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bring your children from the east and gather you from the west.
23Is 43:6 I will say to the north, 'Give them up!' and to the south, 'Do not hold them back.' Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth--
23Is 43:7 everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made."
23Is 43:8 Lead out those who have eyes but are blind, who have ears but are deaf.
23Is 43:9 All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble. Which of them foretold this and proclaimed to us the former things? Let them bring in their witnesses to prove they were right, so that others may hear and say, "It is true."
23Is 43:10 "You are my witnesses," declares the LORD, "and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me.
23Is 43:11 I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no savior.
23Is 43:12 I have revealed and saved and proclaimed--I, and not some foreign god among you. You are my witnesses," declares the LORD, "that I am God.
23Is 43:13 Yes, and from ancient days I am he. No one can deliver out of my hand. When I act, who can reverse it?"
23Is 43:14 This is what the LORD says--your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel£º "For your sake I will send to Babylon and bring down as fugitives all the Babylonians, in the ships in which they took pride.
23Is 43:15 I am the LORD, your Holy One, Israel's Creator, your King."
23Is 43:16 This is what the LORD says--he who made a way through the sea, a path through the mighty waters,
23Is 43:17 who drew out the chariots and horses, the army and reinforcements together, and they lay there, never to rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick£º
23Is 43:18 "Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past.
23Is 43:19 See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.
23Is 43:20 The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the desert and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen,
23Is 43:21 the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise.
23Is 43:22 "Yet you have not called upon me, O Jacob, you have not wearied yourselves for me, O Israel.
23Is 43:23 You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honored me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with grain offerings nor wearied you with demands for incense.
23Is 43:24 You have not bought any fragrant calamus for me, or lavished on me the fat of your sacrifices. But you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your offenses.
23Is 43:25 "I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.
23Is 43:26 Review the past for me, let us argue the matter together; state the case for your innocence.
23Is 43:27 Your first father sinned; your spokesmen rebelled against me.
23Is 43:28 So I will disgrace the dignitaries of your temple, and I will consign Jacob to destruction and Israel to scorn.
23Is 44:1 "But now listen, O Jacob, my servant, Israel, whom I have chosen.
23Is 44:2 This is what the LORD says--he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you£º Do not be afraid, O Jacob, my servant, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
23Is 44:3 For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants.
23Is 44:4 They will spring up like grass in a meadow, like poplar trees by flowing streams.
23Is 44:5 One will say, 'I belong to the LORD'; another will call himself by the name of Jacob; still another will write on his hand, 'The LORD'S,' and will take the name Israel.
23Is 44:6 "This is what the LORD says--Israel's King and Redeemer, the LORD Almighty£º I am the first and I am the last; apart from me there is no God.
23Is 44:7 Who then is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and lay out before me what has happened since I established my ancient people, and what is yet to come--yes, let him foretell what will come.
23Is 44:8 Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim this and foretell it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one."
23Is 44:9 All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Those who would speak up for them are blind; they are ignorant, to their own shame.
23Is 44:10 Who shapes a god and casts an idol, which can profit him nothing?
23Is 44:11 He and his kind will be put to shame; craftsmen are nothing but men. Let them all come together and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror and infamy.
23Is 44:12 The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers, he forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses his strength; he drinks no water and grows faint.
23Is 44:13 The carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker; he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in the form of man, of man in all his glory, that it may dwell in a shrine.
23Is 44:14 He cut down cedars, or perhaps took a cypress or oak. He let it grow among the trees of the forest, or planted a pine, and the rain made it grow.
23Is 44:15 It is man's fuel for burning; some of it he takes and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it.
23Is 44:16 Half of the wood he burns in the fire; over it he prepares his meal, he roasts his meat and eats his fill. He also warms himself and says, "Ah! I am warm; I see the fire."
23Is 44:17 From the rest he makes a god, his idol; he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says, "Save me; you are my god."
23Is 44:18 They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see, and their minds closed so they cannot understand.
23Is 44:19 No one stops to think, no one has the knowledge or understanding to say, "Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?"
23Is 44:20 He feeds on ashes, a deluded heart misleads him; he cannot save himself, or say, "Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?"
23Is 44:21 "Remember these things, O Jacob, for you are my servant, O Israel. I have made you, you are my servant; O Israel, I will not forget you.
23Is 44:22 I have swept away your offenses like a cloud, your sins like the morning mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed you."
23Is 44:23 Sing for joy, O heavens, for the LORD has done this; shout aloud, O earth beneath. Burst into song, you mountains, you forests and all your trees, for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, he displays his glory in Israel.
23Is 44:24 "This is what the LORD says--your Redeemer, who formed you in the womb£º I am the LORD, who has made all things, who alone stretched out the heavens, who spread out the earth by myself,
23Is 44:25 who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners, who overthrows the learning of the wise and turns it into nonsense,
23Is 44:26 who carries out the words of his servants and fulfills the predictions of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, 'It shall be inhabited,' of the towns of Judah, 'They shall be built,' and of their ruins, 'I will restore them,'
23Is 44:27 who says to the watery deep, 'Be dry, and I will dry up your streams,'
23Is 44:28 who says of Cyrus, 'He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please; he will say of Jerusalem, "Let it be rebuilt," and of the temple, "Let its foundations be laid." '
23Is 45:1 "This is what the LORD says to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him and to strip kings of their armor, to open doors before him so that gates will not be shut£º
23Is 45:2 I will go before you and will level the mountains; I will break down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron.
23Is 45:3 I will give you the treasures of darkness, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the LORD, the God of Israel, who summons you by name.
23Is 45:4 For the sake of Jacob my servant, of Israel my chosen, I summon you by name and bestow on you a title of honor, though you do not acknowledge me.
23Is 45:5 I am the LORD, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged me,
23Is 45:6 so that from the rising of the sun to the place of its setting men may know there is none besides me. I am the LORD, and there is no other.
23Is 45:7 I form the light and create darkness, I bring prosperity and create disaster; I, the LORD, do all these things.
23Is 45:8 "You heavens above, rain down righteousness; let the clouds shower it down. Let the earth open wide, let salvation spring up, let righteousness grow with it; I, the LORD, have created it.
23Is 45:9 "Woe to him who quarrels with his Maker, to him who is but a potsherd among the potsherds on the ground. Does the clay say to the potter, 'What are you making?' Does your work say, 'He has no hands'?
23Is 45:10 Woe to him who says to his father, 'What have you begotten?' or to his mother, 'What have you brought to birth?'
23Is 45:11 "This is what the LORD says--the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker£º Concerning things to come, do you question me about my children, or give me orders about the work of my hands?
23Is 45:12 It is I who made the earth and created mankind upon it. My own hands stretched out the heavens; I marshaled their starry hosts.
23Is 45:13 I will raise up Cyrus in my righteousness£º I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward, says the LORD Almighty."
23Is 45:14 This is what the LORD says£º "The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush, and those tall Sabeans--they will come over to you and will be yours; they will trudge behind you, coming over to you in chains. They will bow down before you and plead with you, saying, 'Surely God is with you, and there is no other; there is no other god.'"
23Is 45:15 Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God and Savior of Israel.
23Is 45:16 All the makers of idols will be put to shame and disgraced; they will go off into disgrace together.
23Is 45:17 But Israel will be saved by the LORD with an everlasting salvation; you will never be put to shame or disgraced, to ages everlasting.
23Is 45:18 For this is what the LORD says--he who created the heavens, he is God; he who fashioned and made the earth, he founded it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited--he says£º "I am the LORD, and there is no other.
23Is 45:19 I have not spoken in secret, from somewhere in a land of darkness; I have not said to Jacob's descendants, 'Seek me in vain.' I, the LORD, speak the truth; I declare what is right.
23Is 45:20 "Gather together and come; assemble, you fugitives from the nations. Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood, who pray to gods that cannot save.
23Is 45:21 Declare what is to be, present it--let them take counsel together. Who foretold this long ago, who declared it from the distant past? Was it not I, the LORD? And there is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Savior; there is none but me.
23Is 45:22 "Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.
23Is 45:23 By myself I have sworn, my mouth has uttered in all integrity a word that will not be revoked£º Before me every knee will bow; by me every tongue will swear.
23Is 45:24 They will say of me, 'In the LORD alone are righteousness and strength.'" All who have raged against him will come to him and be put to shame.
23Is 45:25 But in the LORD all the descendants of Israel will be found righteous and will exult.
23Is 46:1 Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low; their idols are borne by beasts of burden. The images that are carried about are burdensome, a burden for the weary.
23Is 46:2 They stoop and bow down together; unable to rescue the burden, they themselves go off into captivity.
23Is 46:3 "Listen to me, O house of Jacob, all you who remain of the house of Israel, you whom I have upheld since you were conceived, an have carried since your birth.
23Is 46:4 Even to your old age and gray hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have made you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.
23Is 46:5 "To whom will you compare me or count me equal? To whom will you liken me that we may be compared?
23Is 46:6 Some pour out gold from their bags and weigh out silver on the scales; they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god, and they bow down and worship it.
23Is 46:7 They lift it to their shoulders and carry it; they set it up in its place, and there it stands. From that spot it cannot move. Though one cries out to it, it does not answer; it cannot save him from his troubles.
23Is 46:8 "Remember this, fix it in mind, take it to heart, you rebels.
23Is 46:9 Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me.
23Is 46:10 I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come. I say£º My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.
23Is 46:11 From the east I summon a bird of prey; from a far-off land, a man to fulfill my purpose. What I have said, that will I bring about; what I have planned, that will I do.
23Is 46:12 Listen to me, you stubborn-hearted, you who are far from righteousness.
23Is 46:13 I am bringing my righteousness near, it is not far away; and my salvation will not be delayed. I will grant salvation to Zion, my splendor to Israel.
23Is 47:1 "Go down, sit in the dust, Virgin Daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, Daughter of the Babylonians. No more will you be called tender or delicate.
23Is 47:2 Take millstones and grind flour; take off your veil. Lift up your skirts, bare your legs, and wade through the streams.
23Is 47:3 Your nakedness will be exposed and your shame uncovered. I will take vengeance; I will spare no one."
23Is 47:4 Our Redeemer--the LORD Almighty is his name--is the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 47:5 "Sit in silence, go into darkness, Daughter of the Babylonians; no more will you be called queen of kingdoms.
23Is 47:6 I was angry with my people and desecrated my inheritance; I gave them into your hand, and you showed them no mercy. Even on the aged you laid a very heavy yoke.
23Is 47:7 You said, 'I will continue forever--the eternal queen!' But you did not consider these things or reflect on what might happen.
23Is 47:8 "Now then, listen, you wanton creature, lounging in your security and saying to yourself, 'I am, and there is none besides me. I will never be a widow or suffer the loss of children.'
23Is 47:9 Both of these will overtake you in a moment, on a single day£º loss of children and widowhood. They will come upon you in full measure, in spite of your many sorceries and all your potent spells.
23Is 47:10 You have trusted in your wickedness and have said, 'No one sees me.' Your wisdom and knowledge mislead you when you say to yourself, 'I am, and there is none besides me.'
23Is 47:11 Disaster will come upon you, and you will not know how to conjure it away. A calamity will fall upon you that you cannot ward off with a ransom; a catastrophe you cannot foresee will suddenly come upon you.
23Is 47:12 "Keep on, then, with your magic spells and with your many sorceries, which you have labored at since childhood. Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you will cause terror.
23Is 47:13 All the counsel you have received has only worn you out! Let your astrologers come forward, those stargazers who make predictions month by month, let them save you from what is coming upon you.
23Is 47:14 Surely they are like stubble; the fire will burn them up. They cannot even save themselves from the power of the flame. Here are no coals to warm anyone; here is no fire to sit by.
23Is 47:15 That is all they can do for you--these you have labored with and trafficked with since childhood. Each of them goes on in his error; there is not one that can save you.
23Is 48:1 "Listen to this, O house of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel and come from the line of Judah, you who take oaths in the name of the LORD and invoke the God of Israel--but not in truth or righteousness--
23Is 48:2 you who call yourselves citizens of the holy city and rely on the God of Israel--the LORD Almighty is his name£º
23Is 48:3 I foretold the former things long ago, my mouth announced them and I made them known; then suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.
23Is 48:4 For I knew how stubborn you were; the sinews of your neck were iron, your forehead was bronze.
23Is 48:5 Therefore I told you these things long ago; before they happened I announced them to you so that you could not say, 'My idols did them; my wooden image and metal god ordained them.'
23Is 48:6 You have heard these things; look at them all. Will you not admit them? "From now on I will tell you of new things, of hidden things unknown to you.
23Is 48:7 They are created now, and not long ago; you have not heard of them before today. So you cannot say, 'Yes, I knew of them.'
23Is 48:8 You have neither heard nor understood; from of old your ear has not been open. Well do I know how treacherous you are; you were called a rebel from birth.
23Is 48:9 For my own name's sake I delay my wrath; for the sake of my praise I hold it back from you, so as not to cut you off.
23Is 48:10 See, I have refined you, though not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.
23Is 48:11 For my own sake, for my own sake, I do this. How can I let myself be defamed? I will not yield my glory to another.
23Is 48:12 "Listen to me, O Jacob, Israel, whom I have called£º I am he; I am the first and I am the last.
23Is 48:13 My own hand laid the foundations of the earth, and my right hand spread out the heavens; when I summon them, they all stand up together.
23Is 48:14 "Come together, all of you, and listen£º Which of the idols has foretold these things? The LORD'S chosen ally will carry out his purpose against Babylon; his arm will be against the Babylonians.
23Is 48:15 I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him. I will bring him, and he will succeed in his mission.
23Is 48:16 "Come near me and listen to this£º "From the first announcement I have not spoken in secret; at the time it happens, I am there." And now the Sovereign LORD has sent me, with his Spirit.
23Is 48:17 This is what the LORD says--your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel£º "I am the LORD your God, who teaches you what is best for you, who directs you in the way you should go.
23Is 48:18 If only you had paid attention to my commands, your peace would have been like a river, your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
23Is 48:19 Your descendants would have been like the sand, your children like its numberless grains; their name would never be cut off nor destroyed from before me."
23Is 48:20 Leave Babylon, flee from the Babylonians! Announce this with shouts of joy and proclaim it. Send it out to the ends of the earth; say, "The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob."
23Is 48:21 They did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he made water flow for them from the rock; he split the rock and water gushed out.
23Is 48:22 "There is no peace," says the LORD, "for the wicked."
23Is 49:1 Listen to me, you islands; hear this, you distant nations£º Before I was born the LORD called me; from my birth he has made mention of my name.
23Is 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharpened sword, in the shadow of his hand he hid me; he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver.
23Is 49:3 He said to me, "You are my servant, Israel, in whom I will display my splendor."
23Is 49:4 But I said, "I have labored to no purpose; I have spent my strength in vain and for nothing. Yet what is due me is in the LORD'S hand, and my reward is with my God."
23Is 49:5 And now the LORD says--he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring Jacob back to him and gather Israel to himself, for I am honored in the eyes of the LORD and my God has been my strength--
23Is 49:6 he says£º "It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept. I will also make you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth."
23Is 49:7 This is what the LORD says--the Redeemer and Holy One of Israel--to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation, to the servant of rulers£º "Kings will see you and rise up, princes will see and bow down, because of the LORD, who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you."
23Is 49:8 This is what the LORD says£º "In the time of my favor I will answer you, and in the day of salvation I will help you; I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people, to restore the land and to reassign its desolate inheritances,
23Is 49:9 to say to the captives, 'Come out,' and to those in darkness, 'Be free!' "They will feed beside the roads and find pasture on every barren hill.
23Is 49:10 They will neither hunger nor thirst, nor will the desert heat or the sun beat upon them. He who has compassion on them will guide them and lead them beside springs of water.
23Is 49:11 I will turn all my mountains into roads, and my highways will be raised up.
23Is 49:12 See, they will come from afar--some from the north, some from the west, some from the region of Aswan."
23Is 49:13 Shout for joy, O heavens; rejoice, O earth; burst into song, O mountains! For the LORD comforts his people and will have compassion on his afflicted ones.
23Is 49:14 But Zion said, "The LORD has forsaken me, the Lord has forgotten me."
23Is 49:15 "Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you!
23Is 49:16 See, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are ever before me.
23Is 49:17 Your sons hasten back, and those who laid you waste depart from you.
23Is 49:18 Lift up your eyes and look around; all your sons gather and come to you. As surely as I live," declares the LORD, "you will wear them all as ornaments; you will put them on, like a bride.
23Is 49:19 "Though you were ruined and made desolate and your land laid waste, now you will be too small for your people, and those who devoured you will be far away.
23Is 49:20 The children born during your bereavement will yet say in your hearing, 'This place is too small for us; give us more space to live in.'
23Is 49:21 Then you will say in your heart, 'Who bore me these? I was bereaved and barren; I was exiled and rejected. Who brought these up? I was left all alone, but these--where have they come from?'"
23Is 49:22 This is what the Sovereign LORD says£º "See, I will beckon to the Gentiles, I will lift up my banner to the peoples; they will bring your sons in their arms and carry your daughters on their shoulders.
23Is 49:23 Kings will be your foster fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers. They will bow down before you with their faces to the ground; they will lick the dust at your feet. Then you will know that I am the LORD; those who hope in me will not be disappointed."
23Is 49:24 Can plunder be taken from warriors, or captives rescued from the fierce?
23Is 49:25 But this is what the LORD says£º "Yes, captives will be taken from warriors, and plunder retrieved from the fierce; I will contend with those who contend with you, and your children I will save.
23Is 49:26 I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh; they will be drunk on their own blood, as with wine. Then all mankind will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob."
23Is 50:1 This is what the LORD says£º "Where is your mother's certificate of divorce with which I sent her away? Or to which of my creditors did I sell you? Because of your sins you were sold; because of your transgressions your mother was sent away.
23Is 50:2 When I came, why was there no one? When I called, why was there no one to answer? Was my arm too short to ransom you? Do I lack the strength to rescue you? By a mere rebuke I dry up the sea, I turn rivers into a desert; their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst.
23Is 50:3 I clothe the sky with darkness and make sackcloth its covering."
23Is 50:4 The Sovereign LORD has given me an instructed tongue, to know the word that sustains the weary. He wakens me morning by morning, wakens my ear to listen like one being taught.
23Is 50:5 The Sovereign LORD has opened my ears, and I have not been rebellious; I have not drawn back.
23Is 50:6 I offered my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard; I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting.
23Is 50:7 Because the Sovereign LORD helps me, I will not be disgraced. Therefore have I set my face like flint, and I know I will not be put to shame.
23Is 50:8 He who vindicates me is near. Who then will bring charges against me? Let us face each other! Who is my accuser? Let him confront me!
23Is 50:9 It is the Sovereign LORD who helps me. Who is he that will condemn me? They will all wear out like a garment; the moths will eat them up.
23Is 50:10 Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the word of his servant? Let him who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the LORD and rely on his God.
23Is 50:11 But now, all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches, go, walk in the light of your fires and of the torches you have set ablaze. This is what you shall receive from my hand£º You will lie down in torment.
23Is 51:1 "Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness and who seek the LORD£º Look to the rock from which you were cut and to the quarry from which you were hewn;
23Is 51:2 look to Abraham, your father, and to Sarah, who gave you birth. When I called him he was but one, and I blessed him and made him many.
23Is 51:3 The LORD will surely comfort Zion and will look with compassion on all her ruins; he will make her deserts like Eden, her wastelands like the garden of the LORD. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the sound of singing.
23Is 51:4 "Listen to me, my people; hear me, my nation£º The law will go out from me; my justice will become a light to the nations.
23Is 51:5 My righteousness draws near speedily, my salvation is on the way, and my arm will bring justice to the nations. The islands will look to me and wait in hope for my arm.
23Is 51:6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, look at the earth beneath; the heavens will vanish like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment and its inhabitants die like flies. But my salvation will last forever, my righteousness will never fail.
23Is 51:7 "Hear me, you who know what is right, you people who have my law in your hearts£º Do not fear the reproach of men or be terrified by their insults.
23Is 51:8 For the moth will eat them up like a garment; the worm will devour them like wool. But my righteousness will last forever, my salvation through all generations."
23Is 51:9 Awake, awake! Clothe yourself with strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in days gone by, as in generations of old. Was it not you who cut Rahab to pieces, who pierced that monster through?
23Is 51:10 Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made a road in the depths of the sea so that the redeemed might cross over?
23Is 51:11 The ransomed of the LORD will return. They will enter Zion with singing; everlasting joy will crown their heads. Gladness and joy will overtake them, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
23Is 51:12 "I, even I, am he who comforts you. Who are you that you fear mortal men, the sons of men, who are but grass,
23Is 51:13 that you forget the LORD your Maker, who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, that you live in constant terror every day because of the wrath of the oppressor, who is bent on destruction? For where is the wrath of the oppressor?
23Is 51:14 The cowering prisoners will soon be set free; they will not die in their dungeon, nor will they lack bread.
23Is 51:15 For I am the LORD your God, who churns up the sea so that its waves roar--the LORD Almighty is his name.
23Is 51:16 I have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand--I who set the heavens in place, who laid the foundations of the earth, and who say to Zion, 'You are my people.'"
23Is 51:17 Awake, awake! Rise up, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of the LORD the cup of his wrath, you who have drained to its dregs the goblet that makes men stagger.
23Is 51:18 Of all the sons she bore there was none to guide her; of all the sons she reared there was none to take her by the hand.
23Is 51:19 These double calamities have come upon you--who can comfort you?--ruin and destruction, famine and sword--who can console you?
23Is 51:20 Your sons have fainted; they lie at the head of every street, like antelope caught in a net. They are filled with the wrath of the LORD and the rebuke of your God.
23Is 51:21 Therefore hear this, you afflicted one, made drunk, but not with wine.
23Is 51:22 This is what your Sovereign LORD says, your God, who defends his people£º "See, I have taken out of your hand the cup that made you stagger; from that cup, the goblet of my wrath, you will never drink again.
23Is 51:23 I will put it into the hands of your tormentors, who said to you, 'Fall prostrate that we may walk over you.' And you made your back like the ground, like a street to be walked over."
23Is 52:1 Awake, awake, O Zion, clothe yourself with strength. Put on your garments of splendor, O Jerusalem, the holy city. The uncircumcised and defiled will not enter you again.
23Is 52:2 Shake off your dust; rise up, sit enthroned, O Jerusalem. Free yourself from the chains on your neck, O captive Daughter of Zion.
23Is 52:3 For this is what the LORD says£º "You were sold for nothing, and without money you will be redeemed."
23Is 52:4 For this is what the Sovereign LORD says£º "At first my people went down to Egypt to live; lately, Assyria has oppressed them.
23Is 52:5 "And now what do I have here?" declares the LORD. "For my people have been taken away for nothing, and those who rule them mock," declares the LORD. "And all day long my name is constantly blasphemed.
23Is 52:6 Therefore my people will know my name; therefore in that day they will know that it is I who foretold it. Yes, it is I."
23Is 52:7 How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, "Your God reigns!"
23Is 52:8 Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices; together they shout for joy. When the LORD returns to Zion, they will see it with their own eyes.
23Is 52:9 Burst into songs of joy together, you ruins of Jerusalem, for the LORD has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.
23Is 52:10 The LORD will lay bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God.
23Is 52:11 Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no unclean thing! Come out from it and be pure, you who carry the vessels of the LORD.
23Is 52:12 But you will not leave in haste or go in flight; for the LORD will go before you, the God of Israel will be your rear guard.
23Is 52:13 See, my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.
23Is 52:14 Just as there were many who were appalled at him--his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness--
23Is 52:15 so will he sprinkle many nations, and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand.
23Is 53:1 Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
23Is 53:2 He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
23Is 53:3 He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering. Like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
23Is 53:4 Surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows, yet we considered him stricken by God, smitten by him, and afflicted.
23Is 53:5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.
23Is 53:6 We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
23Is 53:7 He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.
23Is 53:8 By oppression and judgment he was taken away. And who can speak of his descendants? For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken.
23Is 53:9 He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.
23Is 53:10 Yet it was the LORD'S will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the LORD makes his life a guilt offering, he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will prosper in his hand.
23Is 53:11 After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.
23Is 53:12 Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
23Is 54:1 "Sing, O barren woman, you who never bore a child; burst into song, shout for joy, you who were never in labor; because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband," says the LORD.
23Is 54:2 "Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back; lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes.
23Is 54:3 For you will spread out to the right and to the left; your descendants will dispossess nations and settle in their desolate cities.
23Is 54:4 "Do not be afraid; you will not suffer shame. Do not fear disgrace; you will not be humiliated. You will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood.
23Is 54:5 For your Maker is your husband--the LORD Almighty is his name--the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; he is called the God of all the earth.
23Is 54:6 The LORD will call you back as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit--a wife who married young, only to be rejected," says your God.
23Is 54:7 "For a brief moment I abandoned you, but with deep compassion I will bring you back.
23Is 54:8 In a surge of anger I hid my face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness I will have compassion on you," says the LORD your Redeemer.
23Is 54:9 "To me this is like the days of Noah, when I swore that the waters of Noah would never again cover the earth. So now I have sworn not to be angry with you, never to rebuke you again.
23Is 54:10 Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed," says the LORD, who has compassion on you.
23Is 54:11 "O afflicted city, lashed by storms and not comforted, I will build you with stones of turquoise, your foundations with sapphires.
23Is 54:12 I will make your battlements of rubies, your gates of sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.
23Is 54:13 All your sons will be taught by the LORD, and great will be your children's peace.
23Is 54:14 In righteousness you will be established£º Tyranny will be far from you; you will have nothing to fear. Terror will be far removed; it will not come near you.
23Is 54:15 If anyone does attack you, it will not be my doing; whoever attacks you will surrender to you.
23Is 54:16 "See, it is I who created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon fit for its work. And it is I who have created the destroyer to work havoc;
23Is 54:17 no weapon forged against you will prevail, and you will refute every tongue that accuses you. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and this is their vindication from me," declares the LORD.
23Is 55:1 "Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you who have no money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.
23Is 55:2 Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in the richest of fare.
23Is 55:3 Give ear and come to me; hear me, that your soul may live. I will make an everlasting covenant with you, my faithful love promised to David.
23Is 55:4 See, I have made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander of the peoples.
23Is 55:5 Surely you will summon nations you know not, and nations that do not know you will hasten to you, because of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has endowed you with splendor."
23Is 55:6 Seek the LORD while he may be found; call on him while he is near.
23Is 55:7 Let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts. Let him turn to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him, and to our God, for he will freely pardon.
23Is 55:8 "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways," declares the LORD.
23Is 55:9 "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.
23Is 55:10 As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater,
23Is 55:11 so is my word that goes out from my mouth£º It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it.
23Is 55:12 You will go out in joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
23Is 55:13 Instead of the thornbush will grow the pine tree, and instead of briers the myrtle will grow. This will be for the LORD'S renown, for an everlasting sign, which will not be destroyed."
23Is 56:1 This is what the LORD says£º "Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed.
23Is 56:2 Blessed is the man who does this, the man who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil."
23Is 56:3 Let no foreigner who has bound himself to the LORD say, "The LORD will surely exclude me from his people." And let not any eunuch complain, "I am only a dry tree."
23Is 56:4 For this is what the LORD says£º "To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant--
23Is 56:5 to them I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters; I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.
23Is 56:6 And foreigners who bind themselves to the LORD to serve him, to love the name of the LORD, and to worship him, all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant--
23Is 56:7 these I will bring to my holy mountain and give them joy in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations."
23Is 56:8 The Sovereign LORD declares--he who gathers the exiles of Israel£º "I will gather still others to them besides those already gathered."
23Is 56:9 Come, all you beasts of the field, come and devour, all you beasts of the forest!
23Is 56:10 Israel's watchmen are blind, they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they lie around and dream, they love to sleep.
23Is 56:11 They are dogs with mighty appetites; they never have enough. They are shepherds who lack understanding; they all turn to their own way, each seeks his own gain.
23Is 56:12 "Come," each one cries, "let me get wine! Let us drink our fill of beer! And tomorrow will be like today, or even far better."
23Is 57:1 The righteous perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; devout men are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil.
23Is 57:2 Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death.
23Is 57:3 "But you--come here, you sons of a sorceress, you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes!
23Is 57:4 Whom are you mocking? At whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, the offspring of liars?
23Is 57:5 You burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree; you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags.
23Is 57:6 The idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion; they, they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. In the light of these things, should I relent?
23Is 57:7 You have made your bed on a high and lofty hill; there you went up to offer your sacrifices.
23Is 57:8 Behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you looked on their nakedness.
23Is 57:9 You went to Molech with olive oil and increased your perfumes. You sent your ambassadors far away; you descended to the grave itself!
23Is 57:10 You were wearied by all your ways, but you would not say, 'It is hopeless.' You found renewal of your strength, and so you did not faint.
23Is 57:11 "Whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have been false to me, and have neither remembered me nor pondered this in your hearts? Is it not because I have long been silent that you do not fear me?
23Is 57:12 I will expose your righteousness and your works, and they will not benefit you.
23Is 57:13 When you cry out for help, let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry all of them off, a mere breath will blow them away. But the man who makes me his refuge will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain."
23Is 57:14 And it will be said£º "Build up, build up, prepare the road! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people."
23Is 57:15 For this is what the high and lofty One says--he who lives forever, whose name is holy£º "I live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.
23Is 57:16 I will not accuse forever, nor will I always be angry, for then the spirit of man would grow faint before me--the breath of man that I have created.
23Is 57:17 I was enraged by his sinful greed; I punished him, and hid my face in anger, yet he kept on in his willful ways.
23Is 57:18 I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will guide him and restore comfort to him,
23Is 57:19 creating praise on the lips of the mourners in Israel. Peace, peace, to those far and near," says the LORD. "And I will heal them."
23Is 57:20 But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waves cast up mire and mud.
23Is 57:21 "There is no peace," says my God, "for the wicked."
23Is 58:1 "Shout it aloud, do not hold back. Raise your voice like a trumpet. Declare to my people their rebellion and to the house of Jacob their sins.
23Is 58:2 For day after day they seek me out; they seem eager to know my ways, as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its God. They ask me for just decisions and seem eager for God to come near them.
23Is 58:3 'Why have we fasted,' they say, 'and you have not seen it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you have not noticed?' "Yet on the day of your fasting, you do as you please and exploit all your workers.
23Is 58:4 Your fasting ends in quarreling and strife, and in striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high.
23Is 58:5 Is this the kind of fast I have chosen, only a day for a man to humble himself? Is it only for bowing one's head like a reed and for lying on sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call a fast, a day acceptable to the LORD?
23Is 58:6 "Is not this the kind of fasting I have chosen£º to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke?
23Is 58:7 Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter--when you see the naked, to clothe him, and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood?
23Is 58:8 Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; then your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the LORD will be your rear guard.
23Is 58:9 Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; you will cry for help, and he will say£º Here am I. "If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with the pointing finger and malicious talk,
23Is 58:10 and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your night will become like the noonday.
23Is 58:11 The LORD will guide you always; he will satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land and will strengthen your frame. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters never fail.
23Is 58:12 Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called Repairer of Broken Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings.
23Is 58:13 "If you keep your feet from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the LORD'S holy day honorable, and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words,
23Is 58:14 then you will find your joy in the LORD, and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father Jacob." The mouth of the LORD has spoken.
23Is 59:1 Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear.
23Is 59:2 But your iniquities have separated you from your God; your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.
23Is 59:3 For your hands are stained with blood, your fingers with guilt. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters wicked things.
23Is 59:4 No one calls for justice; no one pleads his case with integrity. They rely on empty arguments and speak lies; they conceive trouble and give birth to evil.
23Is 59:5 They hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spider's web. Whoever eats their eggs will die, and when one is broken, an adder is hatched.
23Is 59:6 Their cobwebs are useless for clothing; they cannot cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are evil deeds, and acts of violence are in their hands.
23Is 59:7 Their feet rush into sin; they are swift to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are evil thoughts; ruin and destruction mark their ways.
23Is 59:8 The way of peace they do not know; there is no justice in their paths. They have turned them into crooked roads; no one who walks in them will know peace.
23Is 59:9 So justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We look for light, but all is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in deep shadows.
23Is 59:10 Like the blind we grope along the wall, feeling our way like men without eyes. At midday we stumble as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead.
23Is 59:11 We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away.
23Is 59:12 For our offenses are many in your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our offenses are ever with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities£º
23Is 59:13 rebellion and treachery against the LORD, turning our backs on our God, fomenting oppression and revolt, uttering lies our hearts have conceived.
23Is 59:14 So justice is driven back, and righteousness stands at a distance; truth has stumbled in the streets, honesty cannot enter.
23Is 59:15 Truth is nowhere to be found, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The LORD looked and was displeased that there was no justice.
23Is 59:16 He saw that there was no one, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene; so his own arm worked salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him.
23Is 59:17 He put on righteousness as his breastplate, and the helmet of salvation on his head; he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak.
23Is 59:18 According to what they have done, so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes; he will repay the islands their due.
23Is 59:19 From the west, men will fear the name of the LORD, and from the rising of the sun, they will revere his glory. For he will come like a pent-up flood that the breath of the LORD drives along.
23Is 59:20 "The Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who repent of their sins," declares the LORD.
23Is 59:21 "As for me, this is my covenant with them," says the LORD. "My Spirit, who is on you, and my words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth, or from the mouths of your children, or from the mouths of their descendants from this time on and forever," says the LORD.
23Is 60:1 "Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the LORD rises upon you.
23Is 60:2 See, darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples, but the LORD rises upon you and his glory appears over you.
23Is 60:3 Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn.
23Is 60:4 "Lift up your eyes and look about you£º All assemble and come to you; your sons come from afar, and your daughters are carried on the arm.
23Is 60:5 Then you will look and be radiant, your heart will throb and swell with joy; the wealth on the seas will be brought to you, to you the riches of the nations will come.
23Is 60:6 Herds of camels will cover your land, young camels of Midian and Ephah. And all from Sheba will come, bearing gold and incense and proclaiming the praise of the LORD.
23Is 60:7 All Kedar's flocks will be gathered to you, the rams of Nebaioth will serve you; they will be accepted as offerings on my altar, and I will adorn my glorious temple.
23Is 60:8 "Who are these that fly along like clouds, like doves to their nests?
23Is 60:9 Surely the islands look to me; in the lead are the ships of Tarshish, bringing your sons from afar, with their silver and gold, to the honor of the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has endowed you with splendor.
23Is 60:10 "Foreigners will rebuild your walls, and their kings will serve you. Though in anger I struck you, in favor I will show you compassion.
23Is 60:11 Your gates will always stand open, they will never be shut, day or night, so that men may bring you the wealth of the nations--their kings led in triumphal procession.
23Is 60:12 For the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish; it will be utterly ruined.
23Is 60:13 "The glory of Lebanon will come to you, the pine, the fir and the cypress together, to adorn the place of my sanctuary; and I will glorify the place of my feet.
23Is 60:14 The sons of your oppressors will come bowing before you; all who despise you will bow down at your feet and will call you the City of the LORD, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 60:15 "Although you have been forsaken and hated, with no one traveling through, I will make you the everlasting pride and the joy of all generations.
23Is 60:16 You will drink the milk of nations and be nursed at royal breasts. Then you will know that I, the LORD, am your Savior, your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
23Is 60:17 Instead of bronze I will bring you gold, and silver in place of iron. Instead of wood I will bring you bronze, and iron in place of stones. I will make peace your governor and righteousness your ruler.
23Is 60:18 No longer will violence be heard in your land, nor ruin or destruction within your borders, but you will call your walls Salvation and your gates Praise.
23Is 60:19 The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you, for the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.
23Is 60:20 Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the LORD will be your everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.
23Is 60:21 Then will all your people be righteous and they will possess the land forever. They are the shoot I have planted, the work of my hands, for the display of my splendor.
23Is 60:22 The least of you will become a thousand, the smallest a mighty nation. I am the LORD; in its time I will do this swiftly."
23Is 61:1 The Spirit of the Sovereign LORD is on me, because the LORD has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners,
23Is 61:2 to proclaim the year of the LORD'S favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn,
23Is 61:3 and provide for those who grieve in Zion--to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the LORD for the display of his splendor.
23Is 61:4 They will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated; they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations.
23Is 61:5 Aliens will shepherd your flocks; foreigners will work your fields and vineyards.
23Is 61:6 And you will be called priests of the LORD, you will be named ministers of our God. You will feed on the wealth of nations, and in their riches you will boast.
23Is 61:7 Instead of their shame my people will receive a double portion, and instead of disgrace they will rejoice in their inheritance; and so they will inherit a double portion in their land, and everlasting joy will be theirs.
23Is 61:8 "For I, the LORD, love justice; I hate robbery and iniquity. In my faithfulness I will reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them.
23Is 61:9 Their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the LORD has blessed."
23Is 61:10 I delight greatly in the LORD; my soul rejoices in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
23Is 61:11 For as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign LORD will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations.
23Is 62:1 For Zion's sake I will not keep silent, for Jerusalem's sake I will not remain quiet, till her righteousness shines out like the dawn, her salvation like a blazing torch.
23Is 62:2 The nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory; you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will bestow.
23Is 62:3 You will be a crown of splendor in the LORD'S hand, a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
23Is 62:4 No longer will they call you Deserted, or name your land Desolate. But you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for the LORD will take delight in you, and your land will be married.
23Is 62:5 As a young man marries a maiden, so will your sons marry you; as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God rejoice over you.
23Is 62:6 I have posted watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD, give yourselves no rest,
23Is 62:7 and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.
23Is 62:8 The LORD has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm£º "Never again will I give your grain as food for your enemies, and never again will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled;
23Is 62:9 but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary."
23Is 62:10 Pass through, pass through the gates! Prepare the way for the people. Build up, build up the highway! Remove the stones. Raise a banner for the nations.
23Is 62:11 The LORD has made proclamation to the ends of the earth£º "Say to the Daughter of Zion, 'See, your Savior comes! See, his reward is with him, and his recompense accompanies him.'"
23Is 62:12 They will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of the LORD; and you will be called Sought After, the City No Longer Deserted.
23Is 63:1 Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah, with his garments stained crimson? Who is this, robed in splendor, striding forward in the greatness of his strength? "It is I, speaking in righteousness, mighty to save."
23Is 63:2 Why are your garments red, like those of one treading the winepress?
23Is 63:3 "I have trodden the winepress alone; from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath; their blood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing.
23Is 63:4 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redemption has come.
23Is 63:5 I looked, but there was no one to help, I was appalled that no one gave support; so my own arm worked salvation for me, and my own wrath sustained me.
23Is 63:6 I trampled the nations in my anger; in my wrath I made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground."
23Is 63:7 I will tell of the kindnesses of the LORD, the deeds for which he is to be praised, according to all the LORD has done for us--yes, the many good things he has done for the house of Israel, according to his compassion and many kindnesses.
23Is 63:8 He said, "Surely they are my people, sons who will not be false to me"; and so he became their Savior.
23Is 63:9 In all their distress he too was distressed, and the angel of his presence saved them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old.
23Is 63:10 Yet they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them.
23Is 63:11 Then his people recalled the days of old, the days of Moses and his people--where is he who brought them through the sea, with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who set his Holy Spirit among them,
23Is 63:12 who sent his glorious arm of power to be at Moses' right hand, who divided the waters before them, to gain for himself everlasting renown,
23Is 63:13 who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble;
23Is 63:14 like cattle that go down to the plain, they were given rest by the Spirit of the LORD. This is how you guided your people to make for yourself a glorious name.
23Is 63:15 Look down from heaven and see from your lofty throne, holy and glorious. Where are your zeal and your might? Your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us.
23Is 63:16 But you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us or Israel acknowledge us; you, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.
23Is 63:17 Why, O LORD, do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts so we do not revere you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes that are your inheritance.
23Is 63:18 For a little while your people possessed your holy place, but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary.
23Is 63:19 We are yours from of old; but you have not ruled over them, they have not been called by your name.
23Is 64:1 Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains would tremble before you!
23Is 64:2 As when fire sets twigs ablaze and causes water to boil, come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause the nations to quake before you!
23Is 64:3 For when you did awesome things that we did not expect, you came down, and the mountains trembled before you.
23Is 64:4 Since ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.
23Is 64:5 You come to the help of those who gladly do right, who remember your ways. But when we continued to sin against them, you were angry. How then can we be saved?
23Is 64:6 All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.
23Is 64:7 No one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away because of our sins.
23Is 64:8 Yet, O LORD, you are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.
23Is 64:9 Do not be angry beyond measure, O LORD; do not remember our sins forever. Oh, look upon us, we pray, for we are all your people.
23Is 64:10 Your sacred cities have become a desert; even Zion is a desert, Jerusalem a desolation.
23Is 64:11 Our holy and glorious temple, where our fathers praised you, has been burned with fire, and all that we treasured lies in ruins.
23Is 64:12 After all this, O LORD, will you hold yourself back? Will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure?
23Is 65:1 "I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me; I was found by those who did not seek me. To a nation that did not call on my name, I said, 'Here am I, here am I.'
23Is 65:2 All day long I have held out my hands to an obstinate people, who walk in ways not good, pursuing their own imaginations--
23Is 65:3 a people who continually provoke me to my very face, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick;
23Is 65:4 who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil; who eat the flesh of pigs, and whose pots hold broth of unclean meat;
23Is 65:5 who say, 'Keep away; don't come near me, for I am too sacred for you!' Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that keeps burning all day.
23Is 65:6 "See, it stands written before me£º I will not keep silent but will pay back in full; I will pay it back into their laps--
23Is 65:7 both your sins and the sins of your fathers," says the LORD. "Because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills, I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds."
23Is 65:8 This is what the LORD says£º "As when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and men say, 'Don't destroy it, there is yet some good in it,' so will I do in behalf of my servants; I will not destroy them all.
23Is 65:9 I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah those who will possess my mountains; my chosen people will inherit them, and there will my servants live.
23Is 65:10 Sharon will become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me.
23Is 65:11 "But as for you who forsake the LORD and forget my holy mountain, who spread a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
23Is 65:12 I will destine you for the sword, and you will all bend down for the slaughter; for I called but you did not answer, I spoke but you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me."
23Is 65:13 Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says£º "My servants will eat, but you will go hungry; my servants will drink, but you will go thirsty; my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.
23Is 65:14 My servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit.
23Is 65:15 You will leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse; the Sovereign LORD will put you to death, but to his servants he will give another name.
23Is 65:16 Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth; he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.
23Is 65:17 "Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth. The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.
23Is 65:18 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy.
23Is 65:19 I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.
23Is 65:20 "Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not live out his years; he who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth; he who fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed.
23Is 65:21 They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
23Is 65:22 No longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat. For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands.
23Is 65:23 They will not toil in vain or bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the LORD, they and their descendants with them.
23Is 65:24 Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.
23Is 65:25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain," says the LORD.
23Is 66:1 This is what the LORD says£º "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you will build for me? Where will my resting place be?
23Is 66:2 Has not my hand made all these things, and so they came into being?" declares the LORD. "This is the one I esteem£º he who is humble and contrite in spirit, and trembles at my word.
23Is 66:3 But whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a man, and whoever offers a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck; whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pig's blood, and whoever burns memorial incense, like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and their souls delight in their abominations;
23Is 66:4 so I also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring upon them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered, when I spoke, no one listened. They did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me."
23Is 66:5 Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word£º "Your brothers who hate you, and exclude you because of my name, have said, 'Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy!' Yet they will be put to shame.
23Is 66:6 Hear that uproar from the city, hear that noise from the temple! It is the sound of the LORD repaying his enemies all they deserve.
23Is 66:7 "Before she goes into labor, she gives birth; before the pains come upon her, she delivers a son.
23Is 66:8 Who has ever heard of such a thing? Who has ever seen such things? Can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet no sooner is Zion in labor than she gives birth to her children.
23Is 66:9 Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?" says the LORD. "Do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?" says your God.
23Is 66:10 "Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly with her, all you who mourn over her.
23Is 66:11 For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance."
23Is 66:12 For this is what the LORD says£º "I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.
23Is 66:13 As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you; and you will be comforted over Jerusalem."
23Is 66:14 When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass; the hand of the LORD will be made known to his servants, but his fury will be shown to his foes.
23Is 66:15 See, the LORD is coming with fire, and his chariots are like a whirlwind; he will bring down his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
23Is 66:16 For with fire and with his sword the LORD will execute judgment upon all men, and many will be those slain by the LORD.
23Is 66:17 "Those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following the one in the midst of those who eat the flesh of pigs and rats and other abominable things--they will meet their end together," declares the LORD.
23Is 66:18 "And I, because of their actions and their imaginations, am about to come and gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see my glory.
23Is 66:19 "I will set a sign among them, and I will send some of those who survive to the nations--to Tarshish, to the Libyans and Lydians (famous as archers), to Tubal and Greece, and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.
23Is 66:20 And they will bring all your brothers, from all the nations, to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the LORD--on horses, in chariots and wagons, and on mules and camels," says the LORD. "They will bring them, as the Israelites bring their grain offerings, to the temple of the LORD in ceremonially clean vessels.
23Is 66:21 And I will select some of them also to be priests and Levites," says the LORD.
23Is 66:22 "As the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me," declares the LORD, "so will your name and descendants endure.
23Is 66:23 From one New Moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come and bow down before me," says the LORD.
23Is 66:24 "And they will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me; their worm will not die, nor will their fire be quenched, and they will be loathsome to all mankind."
