01Gn 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
01Gn 1:2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
01Gn 1:3 And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
01Gn 1:4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
01Gn 1:5 God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning--the first day.
01Gn 1:6 And God said, "Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water."
01Gn 1:7 So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it. And it was so.
01Gn 1:8 God called the expanse "sky." And there was evening, and there was morning--the second day.
01Gn 1:9 And God said, "Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear." And it was so.
01Gn 1:10 God called the dry ground "land," and the gathered waters he called "seas." And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:11 Then God said, "Let the land produce vegetation£º seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds." And it was so.
01Gn 1:12 The land produced vegetation£º plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:13 And there was evening, and there was morning--the third day.
01Gn 1:14 And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years,
01Gn 1:15 and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth." And it was so.
01Gn 1:16 God made two great lights--the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.
01Gn 1:17 God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth,
01Gn 1:18 to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:19 And there was evening, and there was morning--the fourth day.
01Gn 1:20 And God said, "Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky."
01Gn 1:21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:22 God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth."
01Gn 1:23 And there was evening, and there was morning--the fifth day.
01Gn 1:24 And God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds£º livestock, creatures that move along the ground, and wild animals, each according to its kind." And it was so.
01Gn 1:25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:26 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the ground."
01Gn 1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.
01Gn 1:28 God blessed them and said to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground."
01Gn 1:29 Then God said, "I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.
01Gn 1:30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground--everything that has the breath of life in it--I give every green plant for food." And it was so.
01Gn 1:31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning--the sixth day.
01Gn 2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
01Gn 2:2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work.
01Gn 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.
01Gn 2:4 This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens--
01Gn 2:5 and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up, for the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground,
01Gn 2:6 but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground--
01Gn 2:7 the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
01Gn 2:8 Now the LORD God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed.
01Gn 2:9 And the LORD God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground--trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
01Gn 2:10 A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters.
01Gn 2:11 The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold.
01Gn 2:12 (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.)
01Gn 2:13 The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush.
01Gn 2:14 The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
01Gn 2:15 The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.
01Gn 2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;
01Gn 2:17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die."
01Gn 2:18 The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."
01Gn 2:19 Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
01Gn 2:20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.
01Gn 2:21 So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs and closed up the place with flesh.
01Gn 2:22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.
01Gn 2:23 The man said, "This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man."
01Gn 2:24 For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
01Gn 2:25 The man and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.
01Gn 3:1 Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"
01Gn 3:2 The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden,
01Gn 3:3 but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.'"
01Gn 3:4 "You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman.
01Gn 3:5 "For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."
01Gn 3:6 When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.
01Gn 3:7 Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
01Gn 3:8 Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
01Gn 3:9 But the LORD God called to the man, "Where are you?"
01Gn 3:10 He answered, "I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."
01Gn 3:11 And he said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"
01Gn 3:12 The man said, "The woman you put here with me--she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it."
01Gn 3:13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
01Gn 3:14 So the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, "Cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
01Gn 3:15 And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."
01Gn 3:16 To the woman he said, "I will greatly increase your pains in childbearing; with pain you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."
01Gn 3:17 To Adam he said, "Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat of it,' "Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
01Gn 3:18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
01Gn 3:19 By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return."
01Gn 3:20 Adam named his wife Eve, because she would become the mother of all the living.
01Gn 3:21 The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.
01Gn 3:22 And the LORD God said, "The man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever."
01Gn 3:23 So the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken.
01Gn 3:24 After he drove the man out, he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
01Gn 4:1 Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, "With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man."
01Gn 4:2 Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.
01Gn 4:3 In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the LORD.
01Gn 4:4 But Abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
01Gn 4:5 but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast.
01Gn 4:6 Then the LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?
01Gn 4:7 If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it."
01Gn 4:8 Now Cain said to his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the field." And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
01Gn 4:9 Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he replied. "Am I my brother's keeper?"
01Gn 4:10 The LORD said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground.
01Gn 4:11 Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
01Gn 4:12 When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth."
01Gn 4:13 Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is more than I can bear.
01Gn 4:14 Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."
01Gn 4:15 But the LORD said to him, "Not so; if anyone kills Cain, he will suffer vengeance seven times over." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.
01Gn 4:16 So Cain went out from the LORD'S presence and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
01Gn 4:17 Cain lay with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.
01Gn 4:18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.
01Gn 4:19 Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.
01Gn 4:20 Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.
01Gn 4:21 His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.
01Gn 4:22 Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.
01Gn 4:23 Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.
01Gn 4:24 If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times."
01Gn 4:25 Adam lay with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, "God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."
01Gn 4:26 Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time men began to call on the name of the LORD.
01Gn 5:1 This is the written account of Adam's line. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.
01Gn 5:2 He created them male and female and blessed them. And when they were created, he called them "man."
01Gn 5:3 When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son in his own likeness, in his own image; and he named him Seth.
01Gn 5:4 After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:5 Altogether, Adam lived 930 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:6 When Seth had lived 105 years, he became the father of Enosh.
01Gn 5:7 And after he became the father of Enosh, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:8 Altogether, Seth lived 912 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:9 When Enosh had lived 90 years, he became the father of Kenan.
01Gn 5:10 And after he became the father of Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:11 Altogether, Enosh lived 905 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:12 When Kenan had lived 70 years, he became the father of Mahalalel.
01Gn 5:13 And after he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:14 Altogether, Kenan lived 910 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:15 When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he became the father of Jared.
01Gn 5:16 And after he became the father of Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:17 Altogether, Mahalalel lived 895 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:18 When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch.
01Gn 5:19 And after he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:20 Altogether, Jared lived 962 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:21 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah.
01Gn 5:22 And after he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:23 Altogether, Enoch lived 365 years.
01Gn 5:24 Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.
01Gn 5:25 When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he became the father of Lamech.
01Gn 5:26 And after he became the father of Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:27 Altogether, Methuselah lived 969 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:28 When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son.
01Gn 5:29 He named him Noah and said, "He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the LORD has cursed."
01Gn 5:30 After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:31 Altogether, Lamech lived 777 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:32 After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham and Japheth.
01Gn 6:1 When men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,
01Gn 6:2 the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose.
01Gn 6:3 Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days will be a hundred and twenty years."
01Gn 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days--and also afterward--when the sons of God went to the daughters of men and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown.
01Gn 6:5 The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.
01Gn 6:6 The LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain.
01Gn 6:7 So the LORD said, "I will wipe mankind, whom I have created, from the face of the earth--men and animals, and creatures that move along the ground, and birds of the air--for I am grieved that I have made them."
01Gn 6:8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD.
01Gn 6:9 This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked with God.
01Gn 6:10 Noah had three sons£º Shem, Ham and Japheth.
01Gn 6:11 Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight and was full of violence.
01Gn 6:12 God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.
01Gn 6:13 So God said to Noah, "I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth.
01Gn 6:14 So make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out.
01Gn 6:15 This is how you are to build it£º The ark is to be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet high.
01Gn 6:16 Make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top. Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks.
01Gn 6:17 I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish.
01Gn 6:18 But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark--you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you.
01Gn 6:19 You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you.
01Gn 6:20 Two of every kind of bird, of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive.
01Gn 6:21 You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them."
01Gn 6:22 Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
01Gn 7:1 The LORD then said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and your whole family, because I have found you righteous in this generation.
01Gn 7:2 Take with you seven of every kind of clean animal, a male and its mate, and two of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its mate,
01Gn 7:3 and also seven of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth.
01Gn 7:4 Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature I have made."
01Gn 7:5 And Noah did all that the LORD commanded him.
01Gn 7:6 Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth.
01Gn 7:7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
01Gn 7:8 Pairs of clean and unclean animals, of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground,
01Gn 7:9 male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, as God had commanded Noah.
01Gn 7:10 And after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth.
01Gn 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, on the seventeenth day of the second month--on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the heavens were opened.
01Gn 7:12 And rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
01Gn 7:13 On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.
01Gn 7:14 They had with them every wild animal according to its kind, all livestock according to their kinds, every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind, everything with wings.
01Gn 7:15 Pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to Noah and entered the ark.
01Gn 7:16 The animals going in were male and female of every living thing, as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD shut him in.
01Gn 7:17 For forty days the flood kept coming on the earth, and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth.
01Gn 7:18 The waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water.
01Gn 7:19 They rose greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered.
01Gn 7:20 The waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet.
01Gn 7:21 Every living thing that moved on the earth perished--birds, livestock, wild animals, all the creatures that swarm over the earth, and all mankind.
01Gn 7:22 Everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.
01Gn 7:23 Every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out; men and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those with him in the ark.
01Gn 7:24 The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days.
01Gn 8:1 But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and he sent a wind over the earth, and the waters receded.
01Gn 8:2 Now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed, and the rain had stopped falling from the sky.
01Gn 8:3 The water receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down,
01Gn 8:4 and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
01Gn 8:5 The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.
01Gn 8:6 After forty days Noah opened the window he had made in the ark
01Gn 8:7 and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth.
01Gn 8:8 Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground.
01Gn 8:9 But the dove could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark.
01Gn 8:10 He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.
01Gn 8:11 When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.
01Gn 8:12 He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.
01Gn 8:13 By the first day of the first month of Noah's six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.
01Gn 8:14 By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.
01Gn 8:15 Then God said to Noah,
01Gn 8:16 "Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.
01Gn 8:17 Bring out every kind of living creature that is with you--the birds, the animals, and all the creatures that move along the ground--so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it."
01Gn 8:18 So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives.
01Gn 8:19 All the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds--everything that moves on the earth--came out of the ark, one kind after another.
01Gn 8:20 Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and, taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds, he sacrificed burnt offerings on it.
01Gn 8:21 The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart£º "Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.
01Gn 8:22 "As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease."
01Gn 9:1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons, saying to them, "Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.
01Gn 9:2 The fear and dread of you will fall upon all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air, upon every creature that moves along the ground, and upon all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hands.
01Gn 9:3 Everything that lives and moves will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.
01Gn 9:4 "But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.
01Gn 9:5 And for your lifeblood I will surely demand an accounting. I will demand an accounting from every animal. And from each man, too, I will demand an accounting for the life of his fellow man.
01Gn 9:6 "Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God has God made man.
01Gn 9:7 As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it."
01Gn 9:8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him£º
01Gn 9:9 "I now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you
01Gn 9:10 and with every living creature that was with you--the birds, the livestock and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you--every living creature on earth.
01Gn 9:11 I establish my covenant with you£º Never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth."
01Gn 9:12 And God said, "This is the sign of the covenant I am making between me and you and every living creature with you, a covenant for all generations to come£º
01Gn 9:13 I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
01Gn 9:14 Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,
01Gn 9:15 I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life.
01Gn 9:16 Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth."
01Gn 9:17 So God said to Noah, "This is the sign of the covenant I have established between me and all life on the earth."
01Gn 9:18 The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)
01Gn 9:19 These were the three sons of Noah, and from them came the people who were scattered over the earth.
01Gn 9:20 Noah, a man of the soil, proceeded to plant a vineyard.
01Gn 9:21 When he drank some of its wine, he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent.
01Gn 9:22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father's nakedness and told his two brothers outside.
01Gn 9:23 But Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders; then they walked in backward and covered their father's nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their father's nakedness.
01Gn 9:24 When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,
01Gn 9:25 he said, "Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers."
01Gn 9:26 He also said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.
01Gn 9:27 May God extend the territory of Japheth; may Japheth live in the tents of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave."
01Gn 9:28 After the flood Noah lived 350 years.
01Gn 9:29 Altogether, Noah lived 950 years, and then he died.
01Gn 10:1 This is the account of Shem, Ham and Japheth, Noah's sons, who themselves had sons after the flood.
01Gn 10:2 The sons of Japheth£º Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech and Tiras.
01Gn 10:3 The sons of Gomer£º Ashkenaz, Riphath and Togarmah.
01Gn 10:4 The sons of Javan£º Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittim and the Rodanim.
01Gn 10:5 (From these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations, each with its own language.)
01Gn 10:6 The sons of Ham£º Cush, Mizraim, Put and Canaan.
01Gn 10:7 The sons of Cush£º Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah£º Sheba and Dedan.
01Gn 10:8 Cush was the father of Nimrod, who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth.
01Gn 10:9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; that is why it is said, "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD."
01Gn 10:10 The first centers of his kingdom were Babylon, Erech, Akkad and Calneh, in Shinar.
01Gn 10:11 From that land he went to Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah
01Gn 10:12 and Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; that is the great city.
01Gn 10:13 Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,
01Gn 10:14 Pathrusites, Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came) and Caphtorites.
01Gn 10:15 Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,
01Gn 10:16 Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
01Gn 10:17 Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
01Gn 10:18 Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans scattered
01Gn 10:19 and the borders of Canaan reached from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
01Gn 10:20 These are the sons of Ham by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
01Gn 10:21 Sons were also born to Shem, whose older brother was Japheth; Shem was the ancestor of all the sons of Eber.
01Gn 10:22 The sons of Shem£º Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud and Aram.
01Gn 10:23 The sons of Aram£º Uz, Hul, Gether and Meshech.
01Gn 10:24 Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah the father of Eber.
01Gn 10:25 Two sons were born to Eber£º One was named Peleg, because in his time the earth was divided; his brother was named Joktan.
01Gn 10:26 Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
01Gn 10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
01Gn 10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
01Gn 10:29 Ophir, Havilah and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.
01Gn 10:30 The region where they lived stretched from Mesha toward Sephar, in the eastern hill country.
01Gn 10:31 These are the sons of Shem by their clans and languages, in their territories and nations.
01Gn 10:32 These are the clans of Noah's sons, according to their lines of descent, within their nations. From these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood.
01Gn 11:1 Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.
01Gn 11:2 As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
01Gn 11:3 They said to each other, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.
01Gn 11:4 Then they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth."
01Gn 11:5 But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building.
01Gn 11:6 The LORD said, "If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.
01Gn 11:7 Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other."
01Gn 11:8 So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.
01Gn 11:9 That is why it was called Babel--because there the LORD confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
01Gn 11:10 This is the account of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of Arphaxad.
01Gn 11:11 And after he became the father of Arphaxad, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:12 When Arphaxad had lived 35 years, he became the father of Shelah.
01Gn 11:13 And after he became the father of Shelah, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:14 When Shelah had lived 30 years, he became the father of Eber.
01Gn 11:15 And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:16 When Eber had lived 34 years, he became the father of Peleg.
01Gn 11:17 And after he became the father of Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:18 When Peleg had lived 30 years, he became the father of Reu.
01Gn 11:19 And after he became the father of Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:20 When Reu had lived 32 years, he became the father of Serug.
01Gn 11:21 And after he became the father of Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:22 When Serug had lived 30 years, he became the father of Nahor.
01Gn 11:23 And after he became the father of Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:24 When Nahor had lived 29 years, he became the father of Terah.
01Gn 11:25 And after he became the father of Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:26 After Terah had lived 70 years, he became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran.
01Gn 11:27 This is the account of Terah. Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor and Haran. And Haran became the father of Lot.
01Gn 11:28 While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, in the land of his birth.
01Gn 11:29 Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, the father of both Milcah and Iscah.
01Gn 11:30 Now Sarai was barren; she had no children.
01Gn 11:31 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot son of Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, the wife of his son Abram, and together they set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan. But when they came to Haran, they settled there.
01Gn 11:32 Terah lived 205 years, and he died in Haran.
01Gn 12:1 The LORD had said to Abram, "Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you.
01Gn 12:2 "I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.
01Gn 12:3 I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you."
01Gn 12:4 So Abram left, as the LORD had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Haran.
01Gn 12:5 He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there.
01Gn 12:6 Abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
01Gn 12:7 The LORD appeared to Abram and said, "To your offspring I will give this land." So he built an altar there to the LORD, who had appeared to him.
01Gn 12:8 From there he went on toward the hills east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD.
01Gn 12:9 Then Abram set out and continued toward the Negev.
01Gn 12:10 Now there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe.
01Gn 12:11 As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "I know what a beautiful woman you are.
01Gn 12:12 When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife.' Then they will kill me but will let you live.
01Gn 12:13 Say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you."
01Gn 12:14 When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that she was a very beautiful woman.
01Gn 12:15 And when Pharaoh's officials saw her, they praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.
01Gn 12:16 He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep and cattle, male and female donkeys, menservants and maidservants, and camels.
01Gn 12:17 But the LORD inflicted serious diseases on Pharaoh and his household because of Abram's wife Sarai.
01Gn 12:18 So Pharaoh summoned Abram. "What have you done to me?" he said. "Why didn't you tell me she was your wife?
01Gn 12:19 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her to be my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and go!"
01Gn 12:20 Then Pharaoh gave orders about Abram to his men, and they sent him on his way, with his wife and everything he had.
01Gn 13:1 So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.
01Gn 13:2 Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold.
01Gn 13:3 From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier
01Gn 13:4 and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the LORD.
01Gn 13:5 Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.
01Gn 13:6 But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together.
01Gn 13:7 And quarreling arose between Abram's herdsmen and the herdsmen of Lot. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.
01Gn 13:8 So Abram said to Lot, "Let's not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and mine, for we are brothers.
01Gn 13:9 Is not the whole land before you? Let's part company. If you go to the left, I'll go to the right; if you go to the right, I'll go to the left."
01Gn 13:10 Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered, like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, toward Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
01Gn 13:11 So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company£º
01Gn 13:12 Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.
01Gn 13:13 Now the men of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the LORD.
01Gn 13:14 The LORD said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, "Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south, east and west.
01Gn 13:15 All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.
01Gn 13:16 I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted.
01Gn 13:17 Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you."
01Gn 13:18 So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the LORD.
01Gn 14:1 At this time Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim
01Gn 14:2 went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).
01Gn 14:3 All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (the Salt Sea).
01Gn 14:4 For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
01Gn 14:5 In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim
01Gn 14:6 and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the desert.
01Gn 14:7 Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazazon Tamar.
01Gn 14:8 Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim
01Gn 14:9 against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar--four kings against five.
01Gn 14:10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills.
01Gn 14:11 The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away.
01Gn 14:12 They also carried off Abram's nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.
01Gn 14:13 One who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. Now Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were allied with Abram.
01Gn 14:14 When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as Dan.
01Gn 14:15 During the night Abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.
01Gn 14:16 He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, together with the women and the other people.
01Gn 14:17 After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
01Gn 14:18 Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High,
01Gn 14:19 and he blessed Abram, saying, "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.
01Gn 14:20 And blessed be God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand." Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
01Gn 14:21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself."
01Gn 14:22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have raised my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, and have taken an oath
01Gn 14:23 that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or the thong of a sandal, so that you will never be able to say, 'I made Abram rich.'
01Gn 14:24 I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me--to Aner, Eshcol and Mamre. Let them have their share."
01Gn 15:1 After this, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision£º "Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward."
01Gn 15:2 But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"
01Gn 15:3 And Abram said, "You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir."
01Gn 15:4 Then the word of the LORD came to him£º "This man will not be your heir, but a son coming from your own body will be your heir."
01Gn 15:5 He took him outside and said, "Look up at the heavens and count the stars--if indeed you can count them." Then he said to him, "So shall your offspring be."
01Gn 15:6 Abram believed the LORD, and he credited it to him as righteousness.
01Gn 15:7 He also said to him, "I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it."
01Gn 15:8 But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?"
01Gn 15:9 So the LORD said to him, "Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon."
01Gn 15:10 Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half.
01Gn 15:11 Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.
01Gn 15:12 As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him.
01Gn 15:13 Then the LORD said to him, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
01Gn 15:14 But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.
01Gn 15:15 You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.
01Gn 15:16 In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure."
01Gn 15:17 When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.
01Gn 15:18 On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates--
01Gn 15:19 the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
01Gn 15:20 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
01Gn 15:21 Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites."
01Gn 16:1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar;
01Gn 16:2 so she said to Abram, "The LORD has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family through her." Abram agreed to what Sarai said.
01Gn 16:3 So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.
01Gn 16:4 He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.
01Gn 16:5 Then Sarai said to Abram, "You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my servant in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the LORD judge between you and me."
01Gn 16:6 "Your servant is in your hands," Abram said. "Do with her whatever you think best." Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.
01Gn 16:7 The angel of the LORD found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur.
01Gn 16:8 And he said, "Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?" "I'm running away from my mistress Sarai," she answered.
01Gn 16:9 Then the angel of the LORD told her, "Go back to your mistress and submit to her."
01Gn 16:10 The angel added, "I will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count."
01Gn 16:11 The angel of the LORD also said to her£º "You are now with child and you will have a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard of your misery.
01Gn 16:12 He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone's hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers."
01Gn 16:13 She gave this name to the LORD who spoke to her£º "You are the God who sees me," for she said, "I have now seen the One who sees me."
01Gn 16:14 That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.
01Gn 16:15 So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.
01Gn 16:16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
01Gn 17:1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am God Almighty; walk before me and be blameless.
01Gn 17:2 I will confirm my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers."
01Gn 17:3 Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,
01Gn 17:4 "As for me, this is my covenant with you£º You will be the father of many nations.
01Gn 17:5 No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.
01Gn 17:6 I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.
01Gn 17:7 I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
01Gn 17:8 The whole land of Canaan, where you are now an alien, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God."
01Gn 17:9 Then God said to Abraham, "As for you, you must keep my covenant, you and your descendants after you for the generations to come.
01Gn 17:10 This is my covenant with you and your descendants after you, the covenant you are to keep£º Every male among you shall be circumcised.
01Gn 17:11 You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.
01Gn 17:12 For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner--those who are not your offspring.
01Gn 17:13 Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant.
01Gn 17:14 Any uncircumcised male, who has not been circumcised in the flesh, will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant."
01Gn 17:15 God also said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.
01Gn 17:16 I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her."
01Gn 17:17 Abraham fell facedown; he laughed and said to himself, "Will a son be born to a man a hundred years old? Will Sarah bear a child at the age of ninety?"
01Gn 17:18 And Abraham said to God, "If only Ishmael might live under your blessing!"
01Gn 17:19 Then God said, "Yes, but your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
01Gn 17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you£º I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers. He will be the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
01Gn 17:21 But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you by this time next year."
01Gn 17:22 When he had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.
01Gn 17:23 On that very day Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money, every male in his household, and circumcised them, as God told him.
01Gn 17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,
01Gn 17:25 and his son Ishmael was thirteen;
01Gn 17:26 Abraham and his son Ishmael were both circumcised on that same day.
01Gn 17:27 And every male in Abraham's household, including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner, was circumcised with him.
01Gn 18:1 The LORD appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day.
01Gn 18:2 Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.
01Gn 18:3 He said, "If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by.
01Gn 18:4 Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree.
01Gn 18:5 Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way--now that you have come to your servant." "Very well," they answered, "do as you say."
01Gn 18:6 So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. "Quick," he said, "get three seahs of fine flour and knead it and bake some bread."
01Gn 18:7 Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
01Gn 18:8 He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree.
01Gn 18:9 "Where is your wife Sarah?" they asked him. "There, in the tent," he said.
01Gn 18:10 Then the LORD said, "I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son." Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him.
01Gn 18:11 Abraham and Sarah were already old and well advanced in years, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing.
01Gn 18:12 So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, "After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?"
01Gn 18:13 Then the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and say, 'Will I really have a child, now that I am old?'
01Gn 18:14 Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return to you at the appointed time next year and Sarah will have a son."
01Gn 18:15 Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, "I did not laugh." But he said, "Yes, you did laugh."
01Gn 18:16 When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way.
01Gn 18:17 Then the LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?
01Gn 18:18 Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.
01Gn 18:19 For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, so that the LORD will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him."
01Gn 18:20 Then the LORD said, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous
01Gn 18:21 that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know."
01Gn 18:22 The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD.
01Gn 18:23 Then Abraham approached him and said£º "Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
01Gn 18:24 What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it?
01Gn 18:25 Far be it from you to do such a thing--to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"
01Gn 18:26 The LORD said, "If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake."
01Gn 18:27 Then Abraham spoke up again£º "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes,
01Gn 18:28 what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city because of five people?" "If I find forty-five there," he said, "I will not destroy it."
01Gn 18:29 Once again he spoke to him, "What if only forty are found there?" He said, "For the sake of forty, I will not do it."
01Gn 18:30 Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?" He answered, "I will not do it if I find thirty there."
01Gn 18:31 Abraham said, "Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?" He said, "For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it."
01Gn 18:32 Then he said, "May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?" He answered, "For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it."
01Gn 18:33 When the LORD had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home.
01Gn 19:1 The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of the city. When he saw them, he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
01Gn 19:2 "My lords," he said, "please turn aside to your servant's house. You can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morning." "No," they answered, "we will spend the night in the square."
01Gn 19:3 But he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house. He prepared a meal for them, baking bread without yeast, and they ate.
01Gn 19:4 Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the house.
01Gn 19:5 They called to Lot, "Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them."
01Gn 19:6 Lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him
01Gn 19:7 and said, "No, my friends. Don't do this wicked thing.
01Gn 19:8 Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof."
01Gn 19:9 "Get out of our way," they replied. And they said, "This fellow came here as an alien, and now he wants to play the judge! We'll treat you worse than them." They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door.
01Gn 19:10 But the men inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door.
01Gn 19:11 Then they struck the men who were at the door of the house, young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door.
01Gn 19:12 The two men said to Lot, "Do you have anyone else here--sons-in-law, sons or daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of here,
01Gn 19:13 because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the LORD against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it."
01Gn 19:14 So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were pledged to marry his daughters. He said, "Hurry and get out of this place, because the LORD is about to destroy the city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
01Gn 19:15 With the coming of dawn, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Hurry! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away when the city is punished."
01Gn 19:16 When he hesitated, the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city, for the LORD was merciful to them.
01Gn 19:17 As soon as they had brought them out, one of them said, "Flee for your lives! Don't look back, and don't stop anywhere in the plain! Flee to the mountains or you will be swept away!"
01Gn 19:18 But Lot said to them, "No, my lords, please!
01Gn 19:19 Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life. But I can't flee to the mountains; this disaster will overtake me, and I'll die.
01Gn 19:20 Look, here is a town near enough to run to, and it is small. Let me flee to it--it is very small, isn't it? Then my life will be spared."
01Gn 19:21 He said to him, "Very well, I will grant this request too; I will not overthrow the town you speak of.
01Gn 19:22 But flee there quickly, because I cannot do anything until you reach it." (That is why the town was called Zoar.)
01Gn 19:23 By the time Lot reached Zoar, the sun had risen over the land.
01Gn 19:24 Then the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah--from the LORD out of the heavens.
01Gn 19:25 Thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities--and also the vegetation in the land.
01Gn 19:26 But Lot's wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
01Gn 19:27 Early the next morning Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
01Gn 19:28 He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
01Gn 19:29 So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham, and he brought Lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.
01Gn 19:30 Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.
01Gn 19:31 One day the older daughter said to the younger, "Our father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth.
01Gn 19:32 Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father."
01Gn 19:33 That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
01Gn 19:34 The next day the older daughter said to the younger, "Last night I lay with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father."
01Gn 19:35 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.
01Gn 19:36 So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father.
01Gn 19:37 The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites of today.
01Gn 19:38 The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.
01Gn 20:1 Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a while he stayed in Gerar,
01Gn 20:2 and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.
01Gn 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream one night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman."
01Gn 20:4 Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?
01Gn 20:5 Did he not say to me, 'She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, 'He is my brother'? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands."
01Gn 20:6 Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.
01Gn 20:7 Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all yours will die."
01Gn 20:8 Early the next morning Abimelech summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very much afraid.
01Gn 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said, "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done."
01Gn 20:10 And Abimelech asked Abraham, "What was your reason for doing this?"
01Gn 20:11 Abraham replied, "I said to myself, 'There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.'
01Gn 20:12 Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.
01Gn 20:13 And when God had me wander from my father's household, I said to her, 'This is how you can show your love to me£º Everywhere we go, say of me, "He is my brother." '"
01Gn 20:14 Then Abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah his wife to him.
01Gn 20:15 And Abimelech said, "My land is before you; live wherever you like."
01Gn 20:16 To Sarah he said, "I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated."
01Gn 20:17 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his slave girls so they could have children again,
01Gn 20:18 for the LORD had closed up every womb in Abimelech's household because of Abraham's wife Sarah.
01Gn 21:1 Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what he had promised.
01Gn 21:2 Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him.
01Gn 21:3 Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him.
01Gn 21:4 When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God commanded him.
01Gn 21:5 Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
01Gn 21:6 Sarah said, "God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me."
01Gn 21:7 And she added, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age."
01Gn 21:8 The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast.
01Gn 21:9 But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking,
01Gn 21:10 and she said to Abraham, "Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that slave woman's son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac."
01Gn 21:11 The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.
01Gn 21:12 But God said to him, "Do not be so distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.
01Gn 21:13 I will make the son of the maidservant into a nation also, because he is your offspring."
01Gn 21:14 Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy. She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.
01Gn 21:15 When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.
01Gn 21:16 Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she thought, "I cannot watch the boy die." And as she sat there nearby, she began to sob.
01Gn 21:17 God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.
01Gn 21:18 Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation."
01Gn 21:19 Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
01Gn 21:20 God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.
01Gn 21:21 While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.
01Gn 21:22 At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything you do.
01Gn 21:23 Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants. Show to me and the country where you are living as an alien the same kindness I have shown to you."
01Gn 21:24 Abraham said, "I swear it."
01Gn 21:25 Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized.
01Gn 21:26 But Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today."
01Gn 21:27 So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a treaty.
01Gn 21:28 Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,
01Gn 21:29 and Abimelech asked Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?"
01Gn 21:30 He replied, "Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well."
01Gn 21:31 So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there.
01Gn 21:32 After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines.
01Gn 21:33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God.
01Gn 21:34 And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
01Gn 22:1 Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, "Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied.
01Gn 22:2 Then God said, "Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about."
01Gn 22:3 Early the next morning Abraham got up and saddled his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.
01Gn 22:4 On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
01Gn 22:5 He said to his servants, "Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then we will come back to you."
01Gn 22:6 Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,
01Gn 22:7 Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, "Father?" "Yes, my son?" Abraham replied. "The fire and wood are here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
01Gn 22:8 Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together.
01Gn 22:9 When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
01Gn 22:10 Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
01Gn 22:11 But the angel of the LORD called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Here I am," he replied.
01Gn 22:12 "Do not lay a hand on the boy," he said. "Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."
01Gn 22:13 Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
01Gn 22:14 So Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided."
01Gn 22:15 The angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time
01Gn 22:16 and said, "I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,
01Gn 22:17 I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies,
01Gn 22:18 and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me."
01Gn 22:19 Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.
01Gn 22:20 Some time later Abraham was told, "Milcah is also a mother; she has borne sons to your brother Nahor£º
01Gn 22:21 Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),
01Gn 22:22 Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel."
01Gn 22:23 Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Abraham's brother Nahor.
01Gn 22:24 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons£º Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maacah.
01Gn 23:1 Sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven years old.
01Gn 23:2 She died at Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep over her.
01Gn 23:3 Then Abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hittites. He said,
01Gn 23:4 "I am an alien and a stranger among you. Sell me some property for a burial site here so I can bury my dead."
01Gn 23:5 The Hittites replied to Abraham,
01Gn 23:6 "Sir, listen to us. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs. None of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead."
01Gn 23:7 Then Abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land, the Hittites.
01Gn 23:8 He said to them, "If you are willing to let me bury my dead, then listen to me and intercede with Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf
01Gn 23:9 so he will sell me the cave of Machpelah, which belongs to him and is at the end of his field. Ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you."
01Gn 23:10 Ephron the Hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to Abraham in the hearing of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city.
01Gn 23:11 "No, my lord," he said. "Listen to me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the presence of my people. Bury your dead."
01Gn 23:12 Again Abraham bowed down before the people of the land
01Gn 23:13 and he said to Ephron in their hearing, "Listen to me, if you will. I will pay the price of the field. Accept it from me so I can bury my dead there."
01Gn 23:14 Ephron answered Abraham,
01Gn 23:15 "Listen to me, my lord; the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver, but what is that between me and you? Bury your dead."
01Gn 23:16 Abraham agreed to Ephron's terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the Hittites£º four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weight current among the merchants.
01Gn 23:17 So Ephron's field in Machpelah near Mamre--both the field and the cave in it, and all the trees within the borders of the field--was deeded
01Gn 23:18 to Abraham as his property in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of the city.
01Gn 23:19 Afterward Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre (which is at Hebron) in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 23:20 So the field and the cave in it were deeded to Abraham by the Hittites as a burial site.
01Gn 24:1 Abraham was now old and well advanced in years, and the LORD had blessed him in every way.
01Gn 24:2 He said to the chief servant in his household, the one in charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh.
01Gn 24:3 I want you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I am living,
01Gn 24:4 but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son Isaac."
01Gn 24:5 The servant asked him, "What if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?"
01Gn 24:6 "Make sure that you do not take my son back there," Abraham said.
01Gn 24:7 "The LORD, the God of heaven, who brought me out of my father's household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath, saying, 'To your offspring I will give this land'--he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there.
01Gn 24:8 If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there."
01Gn 24:9 So the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
01Gn 24:10 Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and left, taking with him all kinds of good things from his master. He set out for Aram Naharaim and made his way to the town of Nahor.
01Gn 24:11 He had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town; it was toward evening, the time the women go out to draw water.
01Gn 24:12 Then he prayed, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.
01Gn 24:13 See, I am standing beside this spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.
01Gn 24:14 May it be that when I say to a girl, 'Please let down your jar that I may have a drink,' and she says, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too'--let her be the one you have chosen for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."
01Gn 24:15 Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor.
01Gn 24:16 The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had ever lain with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar and came up again.
01Gn 24:17 The servant hurried to meet her and said, "Please give me a little water from your jar."
01Gn 24:18 "Drink, my lord," she said, and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
01Gn 24:19 After she had given him a drink, she said, "I'll draw water for your camels too, until they have finished drinking."
01Gn 24:20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.
01Gn 24:21 Without saying a word, the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the LORD had made his journey successful.
01Gn 24:22 When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.
01Gn 24:23 Then he asked, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
01Gn 24:24 She answered him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor."
01Gn 24:25 And she added, "We have plenty of straw and fodder, as well as room for you to spend the night."
01Gn 24:26 Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD,
01Gn 24:27 saying, "Praise be to the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master's relatives."
01Gn 24:28 The girl ran and told her mother's household about these things.
01Gn 24:29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he hurried out to the man at the spring.
01Gn 24:30 As soon as he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.
01Gn 24:31 "Come, you who are blessed by the LORD," he said. "Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."
01Gn 24:32 So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and fodder were brought for the camels, and water for him and his men to wash their feet.
01Gn 24:33 Then food was set before him, but he said, "I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say." "Then tell us," Laban said.
01Gn 24:34 So he said, "I am Abraham's servant.
01Gn 24:35 The LORD has blessed my master abundantly, and he has become wealthy. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, and camels and donkeys.
01Gn 24:36 My master's wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.
01Gn 24:37 And my master made me swear an oath, and said, 'You must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live,
01Gn 24:38 but go to my father's family and to my own clan, and get a wife for my son.'
01Gn 24:39 "Then I asked my master, 'What if the woman will not come back with me?'
01Gn 24:40 "He replied, 'The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father's family.
01Gn 24:41 Then, when you go to my clan, you will be released from my oath even if they refuse to give her to you--you will be released from my oath.'
01Gn 24:42 "When I came to the spring today, I said, 'O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if you will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.
01Gn 24:43 See, I am standing beside this spring; if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar,"
01Gn 24:44 and if she says to me, "Drink, and I'll draw water for your camels too," let her be the one the LORD has chosen for my master's son.'
01Gn 24:45 "Before I finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out, with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'
01Gn 24:46 "She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, 'Drink, and I'll water your camels too.' So I drank, and she watered the camels also.
01Gn 24:47 "I asked her, 'Whose daughter are you?' "She said, 'The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.' "Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms,
01Gn 24:48 and I bowed down and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my master's brother for his son.
01Gn 24:49 Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn."
01Gn 24:50 Laban and Bethuel answered, "This is from the LORD; we can say nothing to you one way or the other.
01Gn 24:51 Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has directed."
01Gn 24:52 When Abraham's servant heard what they said, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.
01Gn 24:53 Then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother.
01Gn 24:54 Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, he said, "Send me on my way to my master."
01Gn 24:55 But her brother and her mother replied, "Let the girl remain with us ten days or so; then you may go."
01Gn 24:56 But he said to them, "Do not detain me, now that the LORD has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master."
01Gn 24:57 Then they said, "Let's call the girl and ask her about it."
01Gn 24:58 So they called Rebekah and asked her, "Will you go with this man?" "I will go," she said.
01Gn 24:59 So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham's servant and his men.
01Gn 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you increase to thousands upon thousands; may your offspring possess the gates of their enemies."
01Gn 24:61 Then Rebekah and her maids got ready and mounted their camels and went back with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
01Gn 24:62 Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was living in the Negev.
01Gn 24:63 He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.
01Gn 24:64 Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She got down from her camel
01Gn 24:65 and asked the servant, "Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?" "He is my master," the servant answered. So she took her veil and covered herself.
01Gn 24:66 Then the servant told Isaac all he had done.
01Gn 24:67 Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. So she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
01Gn 25:1 Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.
01Gn 25:2 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.
01Gn 25:3 Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.
01Gn 25:4 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.
01Gn 25:5 Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.
01Gn 25:6 But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.
01Gn 25:7 Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and seventy-five years.
01Gn 25:8 Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.
01Gn 25:9 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,
01Gn 25:10 the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.
01Gn 25:11 After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then lived near Beer Lahai Roi.
01Gn 25:12 This is the account of Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Sarah's maidservant, Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham.
01Gn 25:13 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth£º Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
01Gn 25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
01Gn 25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah.
01Gn 25:16 These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.
01Gn 25:17 Altogether, Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people.
01Gn 25:18 His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the border of Egypt, as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.
01Gn 25:19 This is the account of Abraham's son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,
01Gn 25:20 and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
01Gn 25:21 Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.
01Gn 25:22 The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, "Why is this happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD.
01Gn 25:23 The LORD said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger."
01Gn 25:24 When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
01Gn 25:25 The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.
01Gn 25:26 After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.
01Gn 25:27 The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was a quiet man, staying among the tents.
01Gn 25:28 Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
01Gn 25:29 Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.
01Gn 25:30 He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I'm famished!" (That is why he was also called Edom.)
01Gn 25:31 Jacob replied, "First sell me your birthright."
01Gn 25:32 "Look, I am about to die," Esau said. "What good is the birthright to me?"
01Gn 25:33 But Jacob said, "Swear to me first." So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.
01Gn 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.
01Gn 26:1 Now there was a famine in the land--besides the earlier famine of Abraham's time--and Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines in Gerar.
01Gn 26:2 The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, "Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live.
01Gn 26:3 Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham.
01Gn 26:4 I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed,
01Gn 26:5 because Abraham obeyed me and kept my requirements, my commands, my decrees and my laws."
01Gn 26:6 So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
01Gn 26:7 When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, "She is my sister," because he was afraid to say, "She is my wife." He thought, "The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful."
01Gn 26:8 When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
01Gn 26:9 So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, "She is really your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" Isaac answered him, "Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her."
01Gn 26:10 Then Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us."
01Gn 26:11 So Abimelech gave orders to all the people£º "Anyone who molests this man or his wife shall surely be put to death."
01Gn 26:12 Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the LORD blessed him.
01Gn 26:13 The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy.
01Gn 26:14 He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him.
01Gn 26:15 So all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.
01Gn 26:16 Then Abimelech said to Isaac, "Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us."
01Gn 26:17 So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.
01Gn 26:18 Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.
01Gn 26:19 Isaac's servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.
01Gn 26:20 But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen and said, "The water is ours!" So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him.
01Gn 26:21 Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.
01Gn 26:22 He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, "Now the LORD has given us room and we will flourish in the land."
01Gn 26:23 From there he went up to Beersheba.
01Gn 26:24 That night the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham."
01Gn 26:25 Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well.
01Gn 26:26 Meanwhile, Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces.
01Gn 26:27 Isaac asked them, "Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?"
01Gn 26:28 They answered, "We saw clearly that the LORD was with you; so we said, 'There ought to be a sworn agreement between us'--between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you
01Gn 26:29 that you will do us no harm, just as we did not molest you but always treated you well and sent you away in peace. And now you are blessed by the LORD."
01Gn 26:30 Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
01Gn 26:31 Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace.
01Gn 26:32 That day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, "We've found water!"
01Gn 26:33 He called it Shibah, and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba.
01Gn 26:34 When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite.
01Gn 26:35 They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
01Gn 27:1 When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, "My son." "Here I am," he answered.
01Gn 27:2 Isaac said, "I am now an old man and don't know the day of my death.
01Gn 27:3 Now then, get your weapons--your quiver and bow--and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me.
01Gn 27:4 Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die."
01Gn 27:5 Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back,
01Gn 27:6 Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau,
01Gn 27:7 'Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the LORD before I die.'
01Gn 27:8 Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you£º
01Gn 27:9 Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it.
01Gn 27:10 Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies."
01Gn 27:11 Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "But my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I'm a man with smooth skin.
01Gn 27:12 What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing."
01Gn 27:13 His mother said to him, "My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me."
01Gn 27:14 So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it.
01Gn 27:15 Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.
01Gn 27:16 She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins.
01Gn 27:17 Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.
01Gn 27:18 He went to his father and said, "My father." "Yes, my son," he answered. "Who is it?"
01Gn 27:19 Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing."
01Gn 27:20 Isaac asked his son, "How did you find it so quickly, my son?" "The LORD your God gave me success," he replied.
01Gn 27:21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not."
01Gn 27:22 Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
01Gn 27:23 He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.
01Gn 27:24 "Are you really my son Esau?" he asked. "I am," he replied.
01Gn 27:25 Then he said, "My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing." Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank.
01Gn 27:26 Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come here, my son, and kiss me."
01Gn 27:27 So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, "Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed.
01Gn 27:28 May God give you of heaven's dew and of earth's richness--an abundance of grain and new wine.
01Gn 27:29 May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed."
01Gn 27:30 After Isaac finished blessing him and Jacob had scarcely left his father's presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting.
01Gn 27:31 He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, "My father, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing."
01Gn 27:32 His father Isaac asked him, "Who are you?" "I am your son," he answered, "your firstborn, Esau."
01Gn 27:33 Isaac trembled violently and said, "Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him--and indeed he will be blessed!"
01Gn 27:34 When Esau heard his father's words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, "Bless me--me too, my father!"
01Gn 27:35 But he said, "Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing."
01Gn 27:36 Esau said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? He has deceived me these two times£º He took my birthright, and now he's taken my blessing!" Then he asked, "Haven't you reserved any blessing for me?"
01Gn 27:37 Isaac answered Esau, "I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?"
01Gn 27:38 Esau said to his father, "Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!" Then Esau wept aloud.
01Gn 27:39 His father Isaac answered him, "Your dwelling will be away from the earth's richness, away from the dew of heaven above.
01Gn 27:40 You will live by the sword and you will serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will throw his yoke from off your neck."
01Gn 27:41 Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob."
01Gn 27:42 When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, "Your brother Esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you.
01Gn 27:43 Now then, my son, do what I say£º Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.
01Gn 27:44 Stay with him for a while until your brother's fury subsides.
01Gn 27:45 When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I'll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"
01Gn 27:46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I'm disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living."
01Gn 28:1 So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him and commanded him£º "Do not marry a Canaanite woman.
01Gn 28:2 Go at once to Paddan Aram, to the house of your mother's father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.
01Gn 28:3 May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples.
01Gn 28:4 May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now live as an alien, the land God gave to Abraham."
01Gn 28:5 Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
01Gn 28:6 Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, "Do not marry a Canaanite woman,"
01Gn 28:7 and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.
01Gn 28:8 Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac;
01Gn 28:9 so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had.
01Gn 28:10 Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran.
01Gn 28:11 When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep.
01Gn 28:12 He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
01Gn 28:13 There above it stood the LORD, and he said£º "I am the LORD, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.
01Gn 28:14 Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.
01Gn 28:15 I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you."
01Gn 28:16 When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I was not aware of it."
01Gn 28:17 He was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven."
01Gn 28:18 Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it.
01Gn 28:19 He called that place Bethel, though the city used to be called Luz.
01Gn 28:20 Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear
01Gn 28:21 so that I return safely to my father's house, then the LORD will be my God
01Gn 28:22 and this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be God's house, and of all that you give me I will give you a tenth."
01Gn 29:1 Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.
01Gn 29:2 There he saw a well in the field, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. The stone over the mouth of the well was large.
01Gn 29:3 When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well's mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.
01Gn 29:4 Jacob asked the shepherds, "My brothers, where are you from?" "We're from Haran," they replied.
01Gn 29:5 He said to them, "Do you know Laban, Nahor's grandson?" "Yes, we know him," they answered.
01Gn 29:6 Then Jacob asked them, "Is he well?" "Yes, he is," they said, "and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep."
01Gn 29:7 "Look," he said, "the sun is still high; it is not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture."
01Gn 29:8 "We can't," they replied, "until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep."
01Gn 29:9 While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
01Gn 29:10 When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, and Laban's sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncle's sheep.
01Gn 29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.
01Gn 29:12 He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.
01Gn 29:13 As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister's son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home, and there Jacob told him all these things.
01Gn 29:14 Then Laban said to him, "You are my own flesh and blood." After Jacob had stayed with him for a whole month,
01Gn 29:15 Laban said to him, "Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be."
01Gn 29:16 Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
01Gn 29:17 Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was lovely in form, and beautiful.
01Gn 29:18 Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, "I'll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel."
01Gn 29:19 Laban said, "It's better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me."
01Gn 29:20 So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
01Gn 29:21 Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to lie with her."
01Gn 29:22 So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.
01Gn 29:23 But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and Jacob lay with her.
01Gn 29:24 And Laban gave his servant girl Zilpah to his daughter as her maidservant.
01Gn 29:25 When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn't I? Why have you deceived me?"
01Gn 29:26 Laban replied, "It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.
01Gn 29:27 Finish this daughter's bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work."
01Gn 29:28 And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.
01Gn 29:29 Laban gave his servant girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.
01Gn 29:30 Jacob lay with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.
01Gn 29:31 When the LORD saw that Leah was not loved, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.
01Gn 29:32 Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, "It is because the LORD has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now."
01Gn 29:33 She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "Because the LORD heard that I am not loved, he gave me this one too." So she named him Simeon.
01Gn 29:34 Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons." So he was named Levi.
01Gn 29:35 She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, "This time I will praise the LORD." So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.
01Gn 30:1 When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she became jealous of her sister. So she said to Jacob, "Give me children, or I'll die!"
01Gn 30:2 Jacob became angry with her and said, "Am I in the place of God, who has kept you from having children?"
01Gn 30:3 Then she said, "Here is Bilhah, my maidservant. Sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and that through her I too can build a family."
01Gn 30:4 So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife. Jacob slept with her,
01Gn 30:5 and she became pregnant and bore him a son.
01Gn 30:6 Then Rachel said, "God has vindicated me; he has listened to my plea and given me a son." Because of this she named him Dan.
01Gn 30:7 Rachel's servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.
01Gn 30:8 Then Rachel said, "I have had a great struggle with my sister, and I have won." So she named him Naphtali.
01Gn 30:9 When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her maidservant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
01Gn 30:10 Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.
01Gn 30:11 Then Leah said, "What good fortune!" So she named him Gad.
01Gn 30:12 Leah's servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.
01Gn 30:13 Then Leah said, "How happy I am! The women will call me happy." So she named him Asher.
01Gn 30:14 During wheat harvest, Reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants, which he brought to his mother Leah. Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
01Gn 30:15 But she said to her, "Wasn't it enough that you took away my husband? Will you take my son's mandrakes too?" "Very well," Rachel said, "he can sleep with you tonight in return for your son's mandrakes."
01Gn 30:16 So when Jacob came in from the fields that evening, Leah went out to meet him. "You must sleep with me," she said. "I have hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he slept with her that night.
01Gn 30:17 God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant and bore Jacob a fifth son.
01Gn 30:18 Then Leah said, "God has rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband." So she named him Issachar.
01Gn 30:19 Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son.
01Gn 30:20 Then Leah said, "God has presented me with a precious gift. This time my husband will treat me with honor, because I have borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.
01Gn 30:21 Some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
01Gn 30:22 Then God remembered Rachel; he listened to her and opened her womb.
01Gn 30:23 She became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said, "God has taken away my disgrace."
01Gn 30:24 She named him Joseph, and said, "May the LORD add to me another son."
01Gn 30:25 After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me on my way so I can go back to my own homeland.
01Gn 30:26 Give me my wives and children, for whom I have served you, and I will be on my way. You know how much work I've done for you."
01Gn 30:27 But Laban said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, please stay. I have learned by divination that the LORD has blessed me because of you."
01Gn 30:28 He added, "Name your wages, and I will pay them."
01Gn 30:29 Jacob said to him, "You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.
01Gn 30:30 The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?"
01Gn 30:31 "What shall I give you?" he asked. "Don't give me anything," Jacob replied. "But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them£º
01Gn 30:32 Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.
01Gn 30:33 And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen."
01Gn 30:34 "Agreed," said Laban. "Let it be as you have said."
01Gn 30:35 That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.
01Gn 30:36 Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban's flocks.
01Gn 30:37 Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.
01Gn 30:38 Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,
01Gn 30:39 they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.
01Gn 30:40 Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban's animals.
01Gn 30:41 Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,
01Gn 30:42 but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.
01Gn 30:43 In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.
01Gn 31:1 Jacob heard that Laban's sons were saying, "Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father."
01Gn 31:2 And Jacob noticed that Laban's attitude toward him was not what it had been.
01Gn 31:3 Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you."
01Gn 31:4 So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.
01Gn 31:5 He said to them, "I see that your father's attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.
01Gn 31:6 You know that I've worked for your father with all my strength,
01Gn 31:7 yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.
01Gn 31:8 If he said, 'The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, 'The streaked ones will be your wages,' then all the flocks bore streaked young.
01Gn 31:9 So God has taken away your father's livestock and has given them to me.
01Gn 31:10 "In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.
01Gn 31:11 The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob.' I answered, 'Here I am.'
01Gn 31:12 And he said, 'Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
01Gn 31:13 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.'"
01Gn 31:14 Then Rachel and Leah replied, "Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father's estate?
01Gn 31:15 Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.
01Gn 31:16 Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you."
01Gn 31:17 Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,
01Gn 31:18 and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 31:19 When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods.
01Gn 31:20 Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.
01Gn 31:21 So he fled with all he had, and crossing the River, he headed for the hill country of Gilead.
01Gn 31:22 On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
01Gn 31:23 Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.
01Gn 31:24 Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, "Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad."
01Gn 31:25 Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.
01Gn 31:26 Then Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done? You've deceived me, and you've carried off my daughters like captives in war.
01Gn 31:27 Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn't you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and harps?
01Gn 31:28 You didn't even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-by. You have done a foolish thing.
01Gn 31:29 I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, 'Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.'
01Gn 31:30 Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father's house. But why did you steal my gods?"
01Gn 31:31 Jacob answered Laban, "I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.
01Gn 31:32 But if you find anyone who has your gods, he shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.
01Gn 31:33 So Laban went into Jacob's tent and into Leah's tent and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah's tent, he entered Rachel's tent.
01Gn 31:34 Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.
01Gn 31:35 Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period." So he searched but could not find the household gods.
01Gn 31:36 Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. "What is my crime?" he asked Laban. "What sin have I committed that you hunt me down?
01Gn 31:37 Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.
01Gn 31:38 "I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.
01Gn 31:39 I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.
01Gn 31:40 This was my situation£º The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.
01Gn 31:41 It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.
01Gn 31:42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you."
01Gn 31:43 Laban answered Jacob, "The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?
01Gn 31:44 Come now, let's make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us."
01Gn 31:45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.
01Gn 31:46 He said to his relatives, "Gather some stones." So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.
01Gn 31:47 Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.
01Gn 31:48 Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." That is why it was called Galeed.
01Gn 31:49 It was also called Mizpah, because he said, "May the LORD keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.
01Gn 31:50 If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me."
01Gn 31:51 Laban also said to Jacob, "Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.
01Gn 31:52 This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.
01Gn 31:53 May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.
01Gn 31:54 He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.
01Gn 31:55 Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.
01Gn 32:1 Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
01Gn 32:2 When Jacob saw them, he said, "This is the camp of God!" So he named that place Mahanaim.
01Gn 32:3 Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
01Gn 32:4 He instructed them£º "This is what you are to say to my master Esau£º 'Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.
01Gn 32:5 I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, menservants and maidservants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.'"
01Gn 32:6 When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, "We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."
01Gn 32:7 In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well.
01Gn 32:8 He thought, "If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape."
01Gn 32:9 Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, O LORD, who said to me, 'Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,'
01Gn 32:10 I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two groups.
01Gn 32:11 Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.
01Gn 32:12 But you have said, 'I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.'"
01Gn 32:13 He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau£º
01Gn 32:14 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
01Gn 32:15 thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
01Gn 32:16 He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds."
01Gn 32:17 He instructed the one in the lead£º "When my brother Esau meets you and asks, 'To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?'
01Gn 32:18 then you are to say, 'They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.'"
01Gn 32:19 He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds£º "You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
01Gn 32:20 And be sure to say, 'Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.'" For he thought, "I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me."
01Gn 32:21 So Jacob's gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.
01Gn 32:22 That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.
01Gn 32:23 After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.
01Gn 32:24 So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.
01Gn 32:25 When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob's hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.
01Gn 32:26 Then the man said, "Let me go, for it is daybreak." But Jacob replied, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
01Gn 32:27 The man asked him, "What is your name?" "Jacob," he answered.
01Gn 32:28 Then the man said, "Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have overcome."
01Gn 32:29 Jacob said, "Please tell me your name." But he replied, "Why do you ask my name?" Then he blessed him there.
01Gn 32:30 So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, "It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared."
01Gn 32:31 The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.
01Gn 32:32 Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob's hip was touched near the tendon.
01Gn 33:1 Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two maidservants.
01Gn 33:2 He put the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.
01Gn 33:3 He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
01Gn 33:4 But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.
01Gn 33:5 Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. "Who are these with you?" he asked. Jacob answered, "They are the children God has graciously given your servant."
01Gn 33:6 Then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down.
01Gn 33:7 Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.
01Gn 33:8 Esau asked, "What do you mean by all these droves I met?" "To find favor in your eyes, my lord," he said.
01Gn 33:9 But Esau said, "I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself."
01Gn 33:10 "No, please!" said Jacob. "If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.
01Gn 33:11 Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need." And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.
01Gn 33:12 Then Esau said, "Let us be on our way; I'll accompany you."
01Gn 33:13 But Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.
01Gn 33:14 So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir."
01Gn 33:15 Esau said, "Then let me leave some of my men with you." "But why do that?" Jacob asked. "Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord."
01Gn 33:16 So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.
01Gn 33:17 Jacob, however, went to Succoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Succoth.
01Gn 33:18 After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.
01Gn 33:19 For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.
01Gn 33:20 There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.
01Gn 34:1 Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.
01Gn 34:2 When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and violated her.
01Gn 34:3 His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her.
01Gn 34:4 And Shechem said to his father Hamor, "Get me this girl as my wife."
01Gn 34:5 When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he kept quiet about it until they came home.
01Gn 34:6 Then Shechem's father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.
01Gn 34:7 Now Jacob's sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were filled with grief and fury, because Shechem had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter--a thing that should not be done.
01Gn 34:8 But Hamor said to them, "My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.
01Gn 34:9 Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.
01Gn 34:10 You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade in it, and acquire property in it."
01Gn 34:11 Then Shechem said to Dinah's father and brothers, "Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask.
01Gn 34:12 Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I'll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the girl as my wife."
01Gn 34:13 Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob's sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.
01Gn 34:14 They said to them, "We can't do such a thing; we can't give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.
01Gn 34:15 We will give our consent to you on one condition only£º that you become like us by circumcising all your males.
01Gn 34:16 Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We'll settle among you and become one people with you.
01Gn 34:17 But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we'll take our sister and go."
01Gn 34:18 Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.
01Gn 34:19 The young man, who was the most honored of all his father's household, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob's daughter.
01Gn 34:20 So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to their fellow townsmen.
01Gn 34:21 "These men are friendly toward us," they said. "Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours.
01Gn 34:22 But the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are.
01Gn 34:23 Won't their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let us give our consent to them, and they will settle among us."
01Gn 34:24 All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.
01Gn 34:25 Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.
01Gn 34:26 They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem's house and left.
01Gn 34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled.
01Gn 34:28 They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.
01Gn 34:29 They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses.
01Gn 34:30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed."
01Gn 34:31 But they replied, "Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?"
01Gn 35:1 Then God said to Jacob, "Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau."
01Gn 35:2 So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.
01Gn 35:3 Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone."
01Gn 35:4 So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem.
01Gn 35:5 Then they set out, and the terror of God fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.
01Gn 35:6 Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 35:7 There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.
01Gn 35:8 Now Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So it was named Allon Bacuth.
01Gn 35:9 After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him.
01Gn 35:10 God said to him, "Your name is Jacob, but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel." So he named him Israel.
01Gn 35:11 And God said to him, "I am God Almighty; be fruitful and increase in number. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body.
01Gn 35:12 The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you."
01Gn 35:13 Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him.
01Gn 35:14 Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.
01Gn 35:15 Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.
01Gn 35:16 Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty.
01Gn 35:17 And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, "Don't be afraid, for you have another son."
01Gn 35:18 As she breathed her last--for she was dying--she named her son Ben-Oni. But his father named him Benjamin.
01Gn 35:19 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
01Gn 35:20 Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel's tomb.
01Gn 35:21 Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.
01Gn 35:22 While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. Jacob had twelve sons£º
01Gn 35:23 The sons of Leah£º Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun.
01Gn 35:24 The sons of Rachel£º Joseph and Benjamin.
01Gn 35:25 The sons of Rachel's maidservant Bilhah£º Dan and Naphtali.
01Gn 35:26 The sons of Leah's maidservant Zilpah£º Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.
01Gn 35:27 Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.
01Gn 35:28 Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years.
01Gn 35:29 Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
01Gn 36:1 This is the account of Esau (that is, Edom).
01Gn 36:2 Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan£º Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite--
01Gn 36:3 also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
01Gn 36:4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,
01Gn 36:5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in Canaan.
01Gn 36:6 Esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household, as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob.
01Gn 36:7 Their possessions were too great for them to remain together; the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock.
01Gn 36:8 So Esau (that is, Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir.
01Gn 36:9 This is the account of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir.
01Gn 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons£º Eliphaz, the son of Esau's wife Adah, and Reuel, the son of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:11 The sons of Eliphaz£º Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam and Kenaz.
01Gn 36:12 Esau's son Eliphaz also had a concubine named Timna, who bore him Amalek. These were grandsons of Esau's wife Adah.
01Gn 36:13 The sons of Reuel£º Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were grandsons of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:14 The sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon, whom she bore to Esau£º Jeush, Jalam and Korah.
01Gn 36:15 These were the chiefs among Esau's descendants£º The sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau£º Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,
01Gn 36:16 Korah, Gatam and Amalek. These were the chiefs descended from Eliphaz in Edom; they were grandsons of Adah.
01Gn 36:17 The sons of Esau's son Reuel£º Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These were the chiefs descended from Reuel in Edom; they were grandsons of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:18 The sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah£º Chiefs Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the chiefs descended from Esau's wife Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
01Gn 36:19 These were the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these were their chiefs.
01Gn 36:20 These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the region£º Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01Gn 36:21 Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These sons of Seir in Edom were Horite chiefs.
01Gn 36:22 The sons of Lotan£º Hori and Homam. Timna was Lotan's sister.
01Gn 36:23 The sons of Shobal£º Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
01Gn 36:24 The sons of Zibeon£º Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs in the desert while he was grazing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.
01Gn 36:25 The children of Anah£º Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
01Gn 36:26 The sons of Dishon£º Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran and Keran.
01Gn 36:27 The sons of Ezer£º Bilhan, Zaavan and Akan.
01Gn 36:28 The sons of Dishan£º Uz and Aran.
01Gn 36:29 These were the Horite chiefs£º Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01Gn 36:30 Dishon, Ezer and Dishan. These were the Horite chiefs, according to their divisions, in the land of Seir.
01Gn 36:31 These were the kings who reigned in Edom before any Israelite king reigned£º
01Gn 36:32 Bela son of Beor became king of Edom. His city was named Dinhabah.
01Gn 36:33 When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah succeeded him as king.
01Gn 36:34 When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites succeeded him as king.
01Gn 36:35 When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, succeeded him as king. His city was named Avith.
01Gn 36:36 When Hadad died, Samlah from Masrekah succeeded him as king.
01Gn 36:37 When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth on the river succeeded him as king.
01Gn 36:38 When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Acbor succeeded him as king.
01Gn 36:39 When Baal-Hanan son of Acbor died, Hadad succeeded him as king. His city was named Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-Zahab.
01Gn 36:40 These were the chiefs descended from Esau, by name, according to their clans and regions£º Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
01Gn 36:41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
01Gn 36:42 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
01Gn 36:43 Magdiel and Iram. These were the chiefs of Edom, according to their settlements in the land they occupied. This was Esau the father of the Edomites.
01Gn 37:1 Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
01Gn 37:2 This is the account of Jacob. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.
01Gn 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made a richly ornamented robe for him.
01Gn 37:4 When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.
01Gn 37:5 Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.
01Gn 37:6 He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had£º
01Gn 37:7 We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it."
01Gn 37:8 His brothers said to him, "Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.
01Gn 37:9 Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
01Gn 37:10 When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, "What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?"
01Gn 37:11 His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
01Gn 37:12 Now his brothers had gone to graze their father's flocks near Shechem,
01Gn 37:13 and Israel said to Joseph, "As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them." "Very well," he replied.
01Gn 37:14 So he said to him, "Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me." Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,
01Gn 37:15 a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?"
01Gn 37:16 He replied, "I'm looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?"
01Gn 37:17 "They have moved on from here," the man answered. "I heard them say, 'Let's go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.
01Gn 37:18 But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
01Gn 37:19 "Here comes that dreamer!" they said to each other.
01Gn 37:20 "Come now, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we'll see what comes of his dreams."
01Gn 37:21 When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let's not take his life," he said.
01Gn 37:22 "Don't shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the desert, but don't lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
01Gn 37:23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe--the richly ornamented robe he was wearing--
01Gn 37:24 and they took him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
01Gn 37:25 As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
01Gn 37:26 Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
01Gn 37:27 Come, let's sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed.
01Gn 37:28 So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.
01Gn 37:29 When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.
01Gn 37:30 He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy isn't there! Where can I turn now?"
01Gn 37:31 Then they got Joseph's robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
01Gn 37:32 They took the ornamented robe back to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son's robe."
01Gn 37:33 He recognized it and said, "It is my son's robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces."
01Gn 37:34 Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.
01Gn 37:35 All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said, "in mourning will I go down to the grave to my son." So his father wept for him.
01Gn 37:36 Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard.
01Gn 38:1 At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah.
01Gn 38:2 There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and lay with her;
01Gn 38:3 she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er.
01Gn 38:4 She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan.
01Gn 38:5 She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him.
01Gn 38:6 Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
01Gn 38:7 But Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the LORD'S sight; so the LORD put him to death.
01Gn 38:8 Then Judah said to Onan, "Lie with your brother's wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to produce offspring for your brother."
01Gn 38:9 But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he lay with his brother's wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother.
01Gn 38:10 What he did was wicked in the LORD'S sight; so he put him to death also.
01Gn 38:11 Judah then said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Live as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up." For he thought, "He may die too, just like his brothers." So Tamar went to live in her father's house.
01Gn 38:12 After a long time Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went up to Timnah, to the men who were shearing his sheep, and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went with him.
01Gn 38:13 When Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is on his way to Timnah to shear his sheep,"
01Gn 38:14 she took off her widow's clothes, covered herself with a veil to disguise herself, and then sat down at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. For she saw that, though Shelah had now grown up, she had not been given to him as his wife.
01Gn 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
01Gn 38:16 Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, "Come now, let me sleep with you." "And what will you give me to sleep with you?" she asked.
01Gn 38:17 "I'll send you a young goat from my flock," he said. "Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?" she asked.
01Gn 38:18 He said, "What pledge should I give you?" "Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand," she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him.
01Gn 38:19 After she left, she took off her veil and put on her widow's clothes again.
01Gn 38:20 Meanwhile Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman, but he did not find her.
01Gn 38:21 He asked the men who lived there, "Where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?" "There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here," they said.
01Gn 38:22 So he went back to Judah and said, "I didn't find her. Besides, the men who lived there said, 'There hasn't been any shrine prostitute here.'"
01Gn 38:23 Then Judah said, "Let her keep what she has, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send her this young goat, but you didn't find her."
01Gn 38:24 About three months later Judah was told, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar is guilty of prostitution, and as a result she is now pregnant." Judah said, "Bring her out and have her burned to death!"
01Gn 38:25 As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law. "I am pregnant by the man who owns these," she said. And she added, "See if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are."
01Gn 38:26 Judah recognized them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I wouldn't give her to my son Shelah." And he did not sleep with her again.
01Gn 38:27 When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.
01Gn 38:28 As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand; so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said, "This one came out first."
01Gn 38:29 But when he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, "So this is how you have broken out!" And he was named Perez.
01Gn 38:30 Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out and he was given the name Zerah.
01Gn 39:1 Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh's officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
01Gn 39:2 The LORD was with Joseph and he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
01Gn 39:3 When his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD gave him success in everything he did,
01Gn 39:4 Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.
01Gn 39:5 From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the LORD blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the LORD was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.
01Gn 39:6 So he left in Joseph's care everything he had; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,
01Gn 39:7 and after a while his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, "Come to bed with me!"
01Gn 39:8 But he refused. "With me in charge," he told her, "my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.
01Gn 39:9 No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?"
01Gn 39:10 And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.
01Gn 39:11 One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.
01Gn 39:12 She caught him by his cloak and said, "Come to bed with me!" But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.
01Gn 39:13 When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,
01Gn 39:14 she called her household servants. "Look," she said to them, "this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.
01Gn 39:15 When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."
01Gn 39:16 She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.
01Gn 39:17 Then she told him this story£º "That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.
01Gn 39:18 But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."
01Gn 39:19 When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, "This is how your slave treated me," he burned with anger.
01Gn 39:20 Joseph's master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison,
01Gn 39:21 the LORD was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
01Gn 39:22 So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.
01Gn 39:23 The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's care, because the LORD was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.
01Gn 40:1 Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.
01Gn 40:2 Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
01Gn 40:3 and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.
01Gn 40:4 The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time,
01Gn 40:5 each of the two men--the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison--had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
01Gn 40:6 When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.
01Gn 40:7 So he asked Pharaoh's officials who were in custody with him in his master's house, "Why are your faces so sad today?"
01Gn 40:8 "We both had dreams," they answered, "but there is no one to interpret them." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams."
01Gn 40:9 So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, "In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,
01Gn 40:10 and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.
01Gn 40:11 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup and put the cup in his hand."
01Gn 40:12 "This is what it means," Joseph said to him. "The three branches are three days.
01Gn 40:13 Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh's cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
01Gn 40:14 But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.
01Gn 40:15 For I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon."
01Gn 40:16 When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, "I too had a dream£º On my head were three baskets of bread.
01Gn 40:17 In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."
01Gn 40:18 "This is what it means," Joseph said. "The three baskets are three days.
01Gn 40:19 Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. And the birds will eat away your flesh."
01Gn 40:20 Now the third day was Pharaoh's birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials£º
01Gn 40:21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh's hand,
01Gn 40:22 but he hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.
01Gn 40:23 The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
01Gn 41:1 When two full years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream£º He was standing by the Nile,
01Gn 41:2 when out of the river there came up seven cows, sleek and fat, and they grazed among the reeds.
01Gn 41:3 After them, seven other cows, ugly and gaunt, came up out of the Nile and stood beside those on the riverbank.
01Gn 41:4 And the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.
01Gn 41:5 He fell asleep again and had a second dream£º Seven heads of grain, healthy and good, were growing on a single stalk.
01Gn 41:6 After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted--thin and scorched by the east wind.
01Gn 41:7 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.
01Gn 41:8 In the morning his mind was troubled, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.
01Gn 41:9 Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, "Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.
01Gn 41:10 Pharaoh was once angry with his servants, and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard.
01Gn 41:11 Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
01Gn 41:12 Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.
01Gn 41:13 And things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us£º I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged."
01Gn 41:14 So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.
01Gn 41:15 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."
01Gn 41:16 "I cannot do it," Joseph replied to Pharaoh, "but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires."
01Gn 41:17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile,
01Gn 41:18 when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds.
01Gn 41:19 After them, seven other cows came up--scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:20 The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first.
01Gn 41:21 But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.
01Gn 41:22 "In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.
01Gn 41:23 After them, seven other heads sprouted--withered and thin and scorched by the east wind.
01Gn 41:24 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me."
01Gn 41:25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dreams of Pharaoh are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
01Gn 41:26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; it is one and the same dream.
01Gn 41:27 The seven lean, ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years, and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind£º They are seven years of famine.
01Gn 41:28 "It is just as I said to Pharaoh£º God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
01Gn 41:29 Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt,
01Gn 41:30 but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will ravage the land.
01Gn 41:31 The abundance in the land will not be remembered, because the famine that follows it will be so severe.
01Gn 41:32 The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.
01Gn 41:33 "And now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:34 Let Pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.
01Gn 41:35 They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of Pharaoh, to be kept in the cities for food.
01Gn 41:36 This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be ruined by the famine."
01Gn 41:37 The plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his officials.
01Gn 41:38 So Pharaoh asked them, "Can we find anyone like this man, one in whom is the spirit of God?"
01Gn 41:39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one so discerning and wise as you.
01Gn 41:40 You shall be in charge of my palace, and all my people are to submit to your orders. Only with respect to the throne will I be greater than you."
01Gn 41:41 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I hereby put you in charge of the whole land of Egypt."
01Gn 41:42 Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck.
01Gn 41:43 He had him ride in a chariot as his second-in-command, and men shouted before him, "Make way!" Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:44 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all Egypt."
01Gn 41:45 Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph went throughout the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:46 Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh's presence and traveled throughout Egypt.
01Gn 41:47 During the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully.
01Gn 41:48 Joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it.
01Gn 41:49 Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure.
01Gn 41:50 Before the years of famine came, two sons were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
01Gn 41:51 Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, "It is because God has made me forget all my trouble and all my father's household."
01Gn 41:52 The second son he named Ephraim and said, "It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering."
01Gn 41:53 The seven years of abundance in Egypt came to an end,
01Gn 41:54 and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food.
01Gn 41:55 When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh told all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph and do what he tells you."
01Gn 41:56 When the famine had spread over the whole country, Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.
01Gn 41:57 And all the countries came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe in all the world.
01Gn 42:1 When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you just keep looking at each other?"
01Gn 42:2 He continued, "I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die."
01Gn 42:3 Then ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
01Gn 42:4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.
01Gn 42:5 So Israel's sons were among those who went to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan also.
01Gn 42:6 Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the one who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph's brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.
01Gn 42:7 As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. "Where do you come from?" he asked. "From the land of Canaan," they replied, "to buy food."
01Gn 42:8 Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him.
01Gn 42:9 Then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected."
01Gn 42:10 "No, my lord," they answered. "Your servants have come to buy food.
01Gn 42:11 We are all the sons of one man. Your servants are honest men, not spies."
01Gn 42:12 "No!" he said to them. "You have come to see where our land is unprotected."
01Gn 42:13 But they replied, "Your servants were twelve brothers, the sons of one man, who lives in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now with our father, and one is no more."
01Gn 42:14 Joseph said to them, "It is just as I told you£º You are spies!
01Gn 42:15 And this is how you will be tested£º As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
01Gn 42:16 Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will be kept in prison, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. If you are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!"
01Gn 42:17 And he put them all in custody for three days.
01Gn 42:18 On the third day, Joseph said to them, "Do this and you will live, for I fear God£º
01Gn 42:19 If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households.
01Gn 42:20 But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and that you may not die." This they proceeded to do.
01Gn 42:21 They said to one another, "Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life, but we would not listen; that's why this distress has come upon us."
01Gn 42:22 Reuben replied, "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy? But you wouldn't listen! Now we must give an accounting for his blood."
01Gn 42:23 They did not realize that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.
01Gn 42:24 He turned away from them and began to weep, but then turned back and spoke to them again. He had Simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes.
01Gn 42:25 Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man's silver back in his sack, and to give them provisions for their journey. After this was done for them,
01Gn 42:26 they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left.
01Gn 42:27 At the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.
01Gn 42:28 "My silver has been returned," he said to his brothers. "Here it is in my sack." Their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said, "What is this that God has done to us?"
01Gn 42:29 When they came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them. They said,
01Gn 42:30 "The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land.
01Gn 42:31 But we said to him, 'We are honest men; we are not spies.
01Gn 42:32 We were twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is now with our father in Canaan.'
01Gn 42:33 "Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, 'This is how I will know whether you are honest men£º Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take food for your starving households and go.
01Gn 42:34 But bring your youngest brother to me so I will know that you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the land.'"
01Gn 42:35 As they were emptying their sacks, there in each man's sack was his pouch of silver! When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were frightened.
01Gn 42:36 Their father Jacob said to them, "You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more and Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!"
01Gn 42:37 Then Reuben said to his father, "You may put both of my sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will bring him back."
01Gn 42:38 But Jacob said, "My son will not go down there with you; his brother is dead and he is the only one left. If harm comes to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow."
01Gn 43:1 Now the famine was still severe in the land.
01Gn 43:2 So when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, "Go back and buy us a little more food."
01Gn 43:3 But Judah said to him, "The man warned us solemnly, 'You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'
01Gn 43:4 If you will send our brother along with us, we will go down and buy food for you.
01Gn 43:5 But if you will not send him, we will not go down, because the man said to us, 'You will not see my face again unless your brother is with you.'"
01Gn 43:6 Israel asked, "Why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother?"
01Gn 43:7 They replied, "The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. 'Is your father still living?' he asked us. 'Do you have another brother?' We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, 'Bring your brother down here'?"
01Gn 43:8 Then Judah said to Israel his father, "Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.
01Gn 43:9 I myself will guarantee his safety; you can hold me personally responsible for him. If I do not bring him back to you and set him here before you, I will bear the blame before you all my life.
01Gn 43:10 As it is, if we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice."
01Gn 43:11 Then their father Israel said to them, "If it must be, then do this£º Put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift--a little balm and a little honey, some spices and myrrh, some pistachio nuts and almonds.
01Gn 43:12 Take double the amount of silver with you, for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.
01Gn 43:13 Take your brother also and go back to the man at once.
01Gn 43:14 And may God Almighty grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin come back with you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved."
01Gn 43:15 So the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.
01Gn 43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal and prepare dinner; they are to eat with me at noon."
01Gn 43:17 The man did as Joseph told him and took the men to Joseph's house.
01Gn 43:18 Now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house. They thought, "We were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time. He wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys."
01Gn 43:19 So they went up to Joseph's steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house.
01Gn 43:20 "Please, sir," they said, "we came down here the first time to buy food.
01Gn 43:21 But at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver--the exact weight--in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back with us.
01Gn 43:22 We have also brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don't know who put our silver in our sacks."
01Gn 43:23 "It's all right," he said. "Don't be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your silver." Then he brought Simeon out to them.
01Gn 43:24 The steward took the men into Joseph's house, gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys.
01Gn 43:25 They prepared their gifts for Joseph's arrival at noon, because they had heard that they were to eat there.
01Gn 43:26 When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down before him to the ground.
01Gn 43:27 He asked them how they were, and then he said, "How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still living?"
01Gn 43:28 They replied, "Your servant our father is still alive and well." And they bowed low to pay him honor.
01Gn 43:29 As he looked about and saw his brother Benjamin, his own mother's son, he asked, "Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?" And he said, "God be gracious to you, my son."
01Gn 43:30 Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep. He went into his private room and wept there.
01Gn 43:31 After he had washed his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, "Serve the food."
01Gn 43:32 They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to Egyptians.
01Gn 43:33 The men had been seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest; and they looked at each other in astonishment.
01Gn 43:34 When portions were served to them from Joseph's table, Benjamin's portion was five times as much as anyone else's. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
01Gn 44:1 Now Joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house£º "Fill the men's sacks with as much food as they can carry, and put each man's silver in the mouth of his sack.
01Gn 44:2 Then put my cup, the silver one, in the mouth of the youngest one's sack, along with the silver for his grain." And he did as Joseph said.
01Gn 44:3 As morning dawned, the men were sent on their way with their donkeys.
01Gn 44:4 They had not gone far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, "Go after those men at once, and when you catch up with them, say to them, 'Why have you repaid good with evil?
01Gn 44:5 Isn't this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination? This is a wicked thing you have done.'"
01Gn 44:6 When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.
01Gn 44:7 But they said to him, "Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!
01Gn 44:8 We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master's house?
01Gn 44:9 If any of your servants is found to have it, he will die; and the rest of us will become my lord's slaves."
01Gn 44:10 "Very well, then," he said, "let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame."
01Gn 44:11 Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.
01Gn 44:12 Then the steward proceeded to search, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
01Gn 44:13 At this, they tore their clothes. Then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city.
01Gn 44:14 Joseph was still in the house when Judah and his brothers came in, and they threw themselves to the ground before him.
01Gn 44:15 Joseph said to them, "What is this you have done? Don't you know that a man like me can find things out by divination?"
01Gn 44:16 "What can we say to my lord?" Judah replied. "What can we say? How can we prove our innocence? God has uncovered your servants' guilt. We are now my lord's slaves--we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup."
01Gn 44:17 But Joseph said, "Far be it from me to do such a thing! Only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, go back to your father in peace."
01Gn 44:18 Then Judah went up to him and said£º "Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word to my lord. Do not be angry with your servant, though you are equal to Pharaoh himself.
01Gn 44:19 My lord asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'
01Gn 44:20 And we answered, 'We have an aged father, and there is a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one of his mother's sons left, and his father loves him.'
01Gn 44:21 "Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me so I can see him for myself.'
01Gn 44:22 And we said to my lord, 'The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves him, his father will die.'
01Gn 44:23 But you told your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.'
01Gn 44:24 When we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said.
01Gn 44:25 "Then our father said, 'Go back and buy a little more food.'
01Gn 44:26 But we said, 'We cannot go down. Only if our youngest brother is with us will we go. We cannot see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
01Gn 44:27 "Your servant my father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two sons.
01Gn 44:28 One of them went away from me, and I said, "He has surely been torn to pieces." And I have not seen him since.
01Gn 44:29 If you take this one from me too and harm comes to him, you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery.'
01Gn 44:30 "So now, if the boy is not with us when I go back to your servant my father and if my father, whose life is closely bound up with the boy's life,
01Gn 44:31 sees that the boy isn't there, he will die. Your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.
01Gn 44:32 Your servant guaranteed the boy's safety to my father. I said, 'If I do not bring him back to you, I will bear the blame before you, my father, all my life!'
01Gn 44:33 "Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord's slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.
01Gn 44:34 How can I go back to my father if the boy is not with me? No! Do not let me see the misery that would come upon my father."
01Gn 45:1 Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants, and he cried out, "Have everyone leave my presence!" So there was no one with Joseph when he made himself known to his brothers.
01Gn 45:2 And he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and Pharaoh's household heard about it.
01Gn 45:3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is my father still living?" But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.
01Gn 45:4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "Come close to me." When they had done so, he said, "I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt!
01Gn 45:5 And now, do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.
01Gn 45:6 For two years now there has been famine in the land, and for the next five years there will not be plowing and reaping.
01Gn 45:7 But God sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.
01Gn 45:8 "So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God. He made me father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household and ruler of all Egypt.
01Gn 45:9 Now hurry back to my father and say to him, 'This is what your son Joseph says£º God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; don't delay.
01Gn 45:10 You shall live in the region of Goshen and be near me--you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all you have.
01Gn 45:11 I will provide for you there, because five years of famine are still to come. Otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute.'
01Gn 45:12 "You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that it is really I who am speaking to you.
01Gn 45:13 Tell my father about all the honor accorded me in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly."
01Gn 45:14 Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping.
01Gn 45:15 And he kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterward his brothers talked with him.
01Gn 45:16 When the news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had come, Pharaoh and all his officials were pleased.
01Gn 45:17 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this£º Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,
01Gn 45:18 and bring your father and your families back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land.'
01Gn 45:19 "You are also directed to tell them, 'Do this£º Take some carts from Egypt for your children and your wives, and get your father and come.
01Gn 45:20 Never mind about your belongings, because the best of all Egypt will be yours.'"
01Gn 45:21 So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them carts, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he also gave them provisions for their journey.
01Gn 45:22 To each of them he gave new clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes.
01Gn 45:23 And this is what he sent to his father£º ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey.
01Gn 45:24 Then he sent his brothers away, and as they were leaving he said to them, "Don't quarrel on the way!"
01Gn 45:25 So they went up out of Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 45:26 They told him, "Joseph is still alive! In fact, he is ruler of all Egypt." Jacob was stunned; he did not believe them.
01Gn 45:27 But when they told him everything Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the carts Joseph had sent to carry him back, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
01Gn 45:28 And Israel said, "I'm convinced! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die."
01Gn 46:1 So Israel set out with all that was his, and when he reached Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.
01Gn 46:2 And God spoke to Israel in a vision at night and said, "Jacob! Jacob!" "Here I am," he replied.
01Gn 46:3 "I am God, the God of your father," he said. "Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there.
01Gn 46:4 I will go down to Egypt with you, and I will surely bring you back again. And Joseph's own hand will close your eyes."
01Gn 46:5 Then Jacob left Beersheba, and Israel's sons took their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to transport him.
01Gn 46:6 They also took with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in Canaan, and Jacob and all his offspring went to Egypt.
01Gn 46:7 He took with him to Egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters--all his offspring.
01Gn 46:8 These are the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob and his descendants) who went to Egypt£º Reuben the firstborn of Jacob.
01Gn 46:9 The sons of Reuben£º Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.
01Gn 46:10 The sons of Simeon£º Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman.
01Gn 46:11 The sons of Levi£º Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
01Gn 46:12 The sons of Judah£º Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez£º Hezron and Hamul.
01Gn 46:13 The sons of Issachar£º Tola, Puah, Jashub and Shimron.
01Gn 46:14 The sons of Zebulun£º Sered, Elon and Jahleel.
01Gn 46:15 These were the sons Leah bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram, besides his daughter Dinah. These sons and daughters of his were thirty-three in all.
01Gn 46:16 The sons of Gad£º Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi and Areli.
01Gn 46:17 The sons of Asher£º Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. The sons of Beriah£º Heber and Malkiel.
01Gn 46:18 These were the children born to Jacob by Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah--sixteen in all.
01Gn 46:19 The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel£º Joseph and Benjamin.
01Gn 46:20 In Egypt, Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
01Gn 46:21 The sons of Benjamin£º Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim and Ard.
01Gn 46:22 These were the sons of Rachel who were born to Jacob--fourteen in all.
01Gn 46:23 The son of Dan£º Hushim.
01Gn 46:24 The sons of Naphtali£º Jahziel, Guni, Jezer and Shillem.
01Gn 46:25 These were the sons born to Jacob by Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel--seven in all.
01Gn 46:26 All those who went to Egypt with Jacob--those who were his direct descendants, not counting his sons' wives--numbered sixty-six persons.
01Gn 46:27 With the two sons who had been born to Joseph in Egypt, the members of Jacob's family, which went to Egypt, were seventy in all.
01Gn 46:28 Now Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to get directions to Goshen. When they arrived in the region of Goshen,
01Gn 46:29 Joseph had his chariot made ready and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel. As soon as Joseph appeared before him, he threw his arms around his father and wept for a long time.
01Gn 46:30 Israel said to Joseph, "Now I am ready to die, since I have seen for myself that you are still alive."
01Gn 46:31 Then Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's household, "I will go up and speak to Pharaoh and will say to him, 'My brothers and my father's household, who were living in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
01Gn 46:32 The men are shepherds; they tend livestock, and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own.'
01Gn 46:33 When Pharaoh calls you in and asks, 'What is your occupation?'
01Gn 46:34 you should answer, 'Your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on, just as our fathers did.' Then you will be allowed to settle in the region of Goshen, for all shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians."
01Gn 47:1 Joseph went and told Pharaoh, "My father and brothers, with their flocks and herds and everything they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in Goshen."
01Gn 47:2 He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:3 Pharaoh asked the brothers, "What is your occupation?" "Your servants are shepherds," they replied to Pharaoh, "just as our fathers were."
01Gn 47:4 They also said to him, "We have come to live here awhile, because the famine is severe in Canaan and your servants' flocks have no pasture. So now, please let your servants settle in Goshen."
01Gn 47:5 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Your father and your brothers have come to you,
01Gn 47:6 and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if you know of any among them with special ability, put them in charge of my own livestock."
01Gn 47:7 Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed Pharaoh,
01Gn 47:8 Pharaoh asked him, "How old are you?"
01Gn 47:9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. My years have been few and difficult, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers."
01Gn 47:10 Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from his presence.
01Gn 47:11 So Joseph settled his father and his brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh directed.
01Gn 47:12 Joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his father's household with food, according to the number of their children.
01Gn 47:13 There was no food, however, in the whole region because the famine was severe; both Egypt and Canaan wasted away because of the famine.
01Gn 47:14 Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan in payment for the grain they were buying, and he brought it to Pharaoh's palace.
01Gn 47:15 When the money of the people of Egypt and Canaan was gone, all Egypt came to Joseph and said, "Give us food. Why should we die before your eyes? Our money is used up."
01Gn 47:16 "Then bring your livestock," said Joseph. "I will sell you food in exchange for your livestock, since your money is gone."
01Gn 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, their sheep and goats, their cattle and donkeys. And he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock.
01Gn 47:18 When that year was over, they came to him the following year and said, "We cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you, there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land.
01Gn 47:19 Why should we perish before your eyes--we and our land as well? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we with our land will be in bondage to Pharaoh. Give us seed so that we may live and not die, and that the land may not become desolate."
01Gn 47:20 So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. The Egyptians, one and all, sold their fields, because the famine was too severe for them. The land became Pharaoh's,
01Gn 47:21 and Joseph reduced the people to servitude, from one end of Egypt to the other.
01Gn 47:22 However, he did not buy the land of the priests, because they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment Pharaoh gave them. That is why they did not sell their land.
01Gn 47:23 Joseph said to the people, "Now that I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh, here is seed for you so you can plant the ground.
01Gn 47:24 But when the crop comes in, give a fifth of it to Pharaoh. The other four-fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children."
01Gn 47:25 "You have saved our lives," they said. "May we find favor in the eyes of our lord; we will be in bondage to Pharaoh."
01Gn 47:26 So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt--still in force today--that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh's.
01Gn 47:27 Now the Israelites settled in Egypt in the region of Goshen. They acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number.
01Gn 47:28 Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and the years of his life were a hundred and forty-seven.
01Gn 47:29 When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, "If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,
01Gn 47:30 but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried." "I will do as you say," he said.
01Gn 47:31 "Swear to me," he said. Then Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
01Gn 48:1 Some time later Joseph was told, "Your father is ill." So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him.
01Gn 48:2 When Jacob was told, "Your son Joseph has come to you," Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed.
01Gn 48:3 Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me
01Gn 48:4 and said to me, 'I am going to make you fruitful and will increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.'
01Gn 48:5 "Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
01Gn 48:6 Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers.
01Gn 48:7 As I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath" (that is, Bethlehem).
01Gn 48:8 When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, "Who are these?"
01Gn 48:9 "They are the sons God has given me here," Joseph said to his father. Then Israel said, "Bring them to me so I may bless them."
01Gn 48:10 Now Israel's eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them.
01Gn 48:11 Israel said to Joseph, "I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too."
01Gn 48:12 Then Joseph removed them from Israel's knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.
01Gn 48:13 And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel's left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel's right hand, and brought them close to him.
01Gn 48:14 But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim's head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh's head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.
01Gn 48:15 Then he blessed Joseph and said, "May the God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
01Gn 48:16 the Angel who has delivered me from all harm--may he bless these boys. May they be called by my name and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they increase greatly upon the earth."
01Gn 48:17 When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim's head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
01Gn 48:18 Joseph said to him, "No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."
01Gn 48:19 But his father refused and said, "I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations."
01Gn 48:20 He blessed them that day and said, "In your name will Israel pronounce this blessing£º 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'" So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
01Gn 48:21 Then Israel said to Joseph, "I am about to die, but God will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers.
01Gn 48:22 And to you, as one who is over your brothers, I give the ridge of land I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow."
01Gn 49:1 Then Jacob called for his sons and said£º "Gather around so I can tell you what will happen to you in days to come.
01Gn 49:2 "Assemble and listen, sons of Jacob; listen to your father Israel.
01Gn 49:3 "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, the first sign of my strength, excelling in honor, excelling in power.
01Gn 49:4 Turbulent as the waters, you will no longer excel, for you went up onto your father's bed, onto my couch and defiled it.
01Gn 49:5 "Simeon and Levi are brothers--their swords are weapons of violence.
01Gn 49:6 Let me not enter their council, let me not join their assembly, for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased.
01Gn 49:7 Cursed be their anger, so fierce, and their fury, so cruel! I will scatter them in Jacob and disperse them in Israel.
01Gn 49:8 "Judah, your brothers will praise you; your hand will be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons will bow down to you.
01Gn 49:9 You are a lion's cub, O Judah; you return from the prey, my son. Like a lion he crouches and lies down, like a lioness--who dares to rouse him?
01Gn 49:10 The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs and the obedience of the nations is his.
01Gn 49:11 He will tether his donkey to a vine, his colt to the choicest branch; he will wash his garments in wine, his robes in the blood of grapes.
01Gn 49:12 His eyes will be darker than wine, his teeth whiter than milk.
01Gn 49:13 "Zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships; his border will extend toward Sidon.
01Gn 49:14 "Issachar is a rawboned donkey lying down between two saddlebags.
01Gn 49:15 When he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land, he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor.
01Gn 49:16 "Dan will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of Israel.
01Gn 49:17 Dan will be a serpent by the roadside, a viper along the path, that bites the horse's heels so that its rider tumbles backward.
01Gn 49:18 "I look for your deliverance, O LORD.
01Gn 49:19 "Gad will be attacked by a band of raiders, but he will attack them at their heels.
01Gn 49:20 "Asher's food will be rich; he will provide delicacies fit for a king.
01Gn 49:21 "Naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns.
01Gn 49:22 "Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall.
01Gn 49:23 With bitterness archers attacked him; they shot at him with hostility.
01Gn 49:24 But his bow remained steady, his strong arms stayed limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob, because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
01Gn 49:25 because of your father's God, who helps you, because of the Almighty, who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above, blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breast and womb.
01Gn 49:26 Your father's blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains, than the bounty of the age-old hills. Let all these rest on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
01Gn 49:27 "Benjamin is a ravenous wolf; in the morning he devours the prey, in the evening he divides the plunder."
01Gn 49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them, giving each the blessing appropriate to him.
01Gn 49:29 Then he gave them these instructions£º "I am about to be gathered to my people. Bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
01Gn 49:30 the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, which Abraham bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field.
01Gn 49:31 There Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, there Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and there I buried Leah.
01Gn 49:32 The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittites."
01Gn 49:33 When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.
01Gn 50:1 Joseph threw himself upon his father and wept over him and kissed him.
01Gn 50:2 Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him,
01Gn 50:3 taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
01Gn 50:4 When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh's court, "If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him,
01Gn 50:5 'My father made me swear an oath and said, "I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan." Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.'"
01Gn 50:6 Pharaoh said, "Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do."
01Gn 50:7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh's officials accompanied him--the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt--
01Gn 50:8 besides all the members of Joseph's household and his brothers and those belonging to his father's household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen.
01Gn 50:9 Chariots and horsemen also went up with him. It was a very large company.
01Gn 50:10 When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father.
01Gn 50:11 When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning." That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.
01Gn 50:12 So Jacob's sons did as he had commanded them£º
01Gn 50:13 They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite, along with the field.
01Gn 50:14 After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father.
01Gn 50:15 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?"
01Gn 50:16 So they sent word to Joseph, saying, "Your father left these instructions before he died£º
01Gn 50:17 'This is what you are to say to Joseph£º I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.' Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father." When their message came to him, Joseph wept.
01Gn 50:18 His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. "We are your slaves," they said.
01Gn 50:19 But Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
01Gn 50:20 You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.
01Gn 50:21 So then, don't be afraid. I will provide for you and your children." And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.
01Gn 50:22 Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father's family. He lived a hundred and ten years
01Gn 50:23 and saw the third generation of Ephraim's children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph's knees.
01Gn 50:24 Then Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."
01Gn 50:25 And Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath and said, "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place."
01Gn 50:26 So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
02
02Ex 1:1 These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family£º
02Ex 1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah;
02Ex 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin;
02Ex 1:4 Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
02Ex 1:5 The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was already in Egypt.
02Ex 1:6 Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,
02Ex 1:7 but the Israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.
02Ex 1:8 Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.
02Ex 1:9 "Look," he said to his people, "the Israelites have become much too numerous for us.
02Ex 1:10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country."
02Ex 1:11 So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
02Ex 1:12 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites
02Ex 1:13 and worked them ruthlessly.
02Ex 1:14 They made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their hard labor the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.
02Ex 1:15 The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,
02Ex 1:16 "When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live."
02Ex 1:17 The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live.
02Ex 1:18 Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, "Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?"
02Ex 1:19 The midwives answered Pharaoh, "Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive."
02Ex 1:20 So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous.
02Ex 1:21 And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
02Ex 1:22 Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people£º "Every boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live."
02Ex 2:1 Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,
02Ex 2:2 and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.
02Ex 2:3 But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
02Ex 2:4 His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
02Ex 2:5 Then Pharaoh's daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants were walking along the river bank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it.
02Ex 2:6 She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This is one of the Hebrew babies," she said.
02Ex 2:7 Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?"
02Ex 2:8 "Yes, go," she answered. And the girl went and got the baby's mother.
02Ex 2:9 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you." So the woman took the baby and nursed him.
02Ex 2:10 When the child grew older, she took him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."
02Ex 2:11 One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.
02Ex 2:12 Glancing this way and that and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
02Ex 2:13 The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, "Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?"
02Ex 2:14 The man said, "Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses was afraid and thought, "What I did must have become known."
02Ex 2:15 When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.
02Ex 2:16 Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father's flock.
02Ex 2:17 Some shepherds came along and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.
02Ex 2:18 When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, "Why have you returned so early today?"
02Ex 2:19 They answered, "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock."
02Ex 2:20 "And where is he?" he asked his daughters. "Why did you leave him? Invite him to have something to eat."
02Ex 2:21 Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.
02Ex 2:22 Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, "I have become an alien in a foreign land."
02Ex 2:23 During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God.
02Ex 2:24 God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob.
02Ex 2:25 So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
02Ex 3:1 Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
02Ex 3:2 There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.
02Ex 3:3 So Moses thought, "I will go over and see this strange sight--why the bush does not burn up."
02Ex 3:4 When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, "Moses! Moses!" And Moses said, "Here I am."
02Ex 3:5 "Do not come any closer," God said. "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."
02Ex 3:6 Then he said, "I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.
02Ex 3:7 The LORD said, "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.
02Ex 3:8 So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey--the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
02Ex 3:9 And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
02Ex 3:10 So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."
02Ex 3:11 But Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
02Ex 3:12 And God said, "I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you£º When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain."
02Ex 3:13 Moses said to God, "Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what shall I tell them?"
02Ex 3:14 God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites£º 'I AM has sent me to you.'"
02Ex 3:15 God also said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has sent me to you.' This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.
02Ex 3:16 "Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, 'The LORD, the God of your fathers--the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--appeared to me and said£º I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
02Ex 3:17 And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites--a land flowing with milk and honey.'
02Ex 3:18 "The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God.'
02Ex 3:19 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.
02Ex 3:20 So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.
02Ex 3:21 "And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.
02Ex 3:22 Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians."
02Ex 4:1 Moses answered, "What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, 'The LORD did not appear to you'?"
02Ex 4:2 Then the LORD said to him, "What is that in your hand?" "A staff," he replied.
02Ex 4:3 The LORD said, "Throw it on the ground." Moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake, and he ran from it.
02Ex 4:4 Then the LORD said to him, "Reach out your hand and take it by the tail." So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand.
02Ex 4:5 "This," said the LORD, "is so that they may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers--the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob--has appeared to you."
02Ex 4:6 Then the LORD said, "Put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was leprous, like snow.
02Ex 4:7 "Now put it back into your cloak," he said. So Moses put his hand back into his cloak, and when he took it out, it was restored, like the rest of his flesh.
02Ex 4:8 Then the LORD said, "If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign, they may believe the second.
02Ex 4:9 But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become blood on the ground."
02Ex 4:10 Moses said to the LORD, "O Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue."
02Ex 4:11 The LORD said to him, "Who gave man his mouth? Who makes him deaf or mute? Who gives him sight or makes him blind? Is it not I, the LORD?
02Ex 4:12 Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say."
02Ex 4:13 But Moses said, "O Lord, please send someone else to do it."
02Ex 4:14 Then the LORD'S anger burned against Moses and he said, "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you, and his heart will be glad when he sees you.
02Ex 4:15 You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.
02Ex 4:16 He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were God to him.
02Ex 4:17 But take this staff in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it."
02Ex 4:18 Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, "Let me go back to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive." Jethro said, "Go, and I wish you well."
02Ex 4:19 Now the LORD had said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead."
02Ex 4:20 So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.
02Ex 4:21 The LORD said to Moses, "When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
02Ex 4:22 Then say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the LORD says£º Israel is my firstborn son,
02Ex 4:23 and I told you, "Let my son go, so he may worship me." But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.'"
02Ex 4:24 At a lodging place on the way, the LORD met Moses and was about to kill him.
02Ex 4:25 But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son's foreskin and touched Moses'feet with it. "Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me," she said.
02Ex 4:26 So the LORD let him alone. (At that time she said "bridegroom of blood," referring to circumcision.)
02Ex 4:27 The LORD said to Aaron, "Go into the desert to meet Moses." So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.
02Ex 4:28 Then Moses told Aaron everything the LORD had sent him to say, and also about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform.
02Ex 4:29 Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,
02Ex 4:30 and Aaron told them everything the LORD had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,
02Ex 4:31 and they believed. And when they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
02Ex 5:1 Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º 'Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.'"
02Ex 5:2 Pharaoh said, "Who is the LORD, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD and I will not let Israel go."
02Ex 5:3 Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword."
02Ex 5:4 But the king of Egypt said, "Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!"
02Ex 5:5 Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."
02Ex 5:6 That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people£º
02Ex 5:7 "You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw.
02Ex 5:8 But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don't reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, 'Let us go and sacrifice to our God.'
02Ex 5:9 Make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies."
02Ex 5:10 Then the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people, "This is what Pharaoh says£º 'I will not give you any more straw.
02Ex 5:11 Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.'"
02Ex 5:12 So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw.
02Ex 5:13 The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, "Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw."
02Ex 5:14 The Israelite foremen appointed by Pharaoh's slave drivers were beaten and were asked, "Why didn't you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?"
02Ex 5:15 Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh£º "Why have you treated your servants this way?
02Ex 5:16 Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, 'Make bricks!' Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people."
02Ex 5:17 Pharaoh said, "Lazy, that's what you are--lazy! That is why you keep saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.'
02Ex 5:18 Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks."
02Ex 5:19 The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, "You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day."
02Ex 5:20 When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,
02Ex 5:21 and they said, "May the LORD look upon you and judge you! You have made us a stench to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us."
02Ex 5:22 Moses returned to the LORD and said, "O Lord, why have you brought trouble upon this people? Is this why you sent me?
02Ex 5:23 Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble upon this people, and you have not rescued your people at all."
02Ex 6:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh£º Because of my mighty hand he will let them go; because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country."
02Ex 6:2 God also said to Moses, "I am the LORD.
02Ex 6:3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by my name the LORD I did not make myself known to them.
02Ex 6:4 I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, where they lived as aliens.
02Ex 6:5 Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.
02Ex 6:6 "Therefore, say to the Israelites£º 'I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians. I will free you from being slaves to them, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.
02Ex 6:7 I will take you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.
02Ex 6:8 And I will bring you to the land I swore with uplifted hand to give to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.'"
02Ex 6:9 Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and cruel bondage.
02Ex 6:10 Then the LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 6:11 "Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his country."
02Ex 6:12 But Moses said to the LORD, "If the Israelites will not listen to me, why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with faltering lips?"
02Ex 6:13 Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron about the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he commanded them to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
02Ex 6:14 These were the heads of their families£º The sons of Reuben the firstborn son of Israel were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.
02Ex 6:15 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
02Ex 6:16 These were the names of the sons of Levi according to their records£º Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Levi lived 137 years.
02Ex 6:17 The sons of Gershon, by clans, were Libni and Shimei.
02Ex 6:18 The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.
02Ex 6:19 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi according to their records.
02Ex 6:20 Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, who bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.
02Ex 6:21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg and Zicri.
02Ex 6:22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan and Sithri.
02Ex 6:23 Aaron married Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
02Ex 6:24 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah and Abiasaph. These were the Korahite clans.
02Ex 6:25 Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families, clan by clan.
02Ex 6:26 It was this same Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, "Bring the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions."
02Ex 6:27 They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. It was the same Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 6:28 Now when the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,
02Ex 6:29 he said to him, "I am the LORD. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I tell you."
02Ex 6:30 But Moses said to the LORD, "Since I speak with faltering lips, why would Pharaoh listen to me?"
02Ex 7:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
02Ex 7:2 You are to say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country.
02Ex 7:3 But I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and though I multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in Egypt,
02Ex 7:4 he will not listen to you. Then I will lay my hand on Egypt and with mighty acts of judgment I will bring out my divisions, my people the Israelites.
02Ex 7:5 And the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I stretch out my hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out of it."
02Ex 7:6 Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them.
02Ex 7:7 Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.
02Ex 7:8 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
02Ex 7:9 "When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a miracle,' then say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,' and it will become a snake."
02Ex 7:10 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the LORD commanded. Aaron threw his staff down in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a snake.
02Ex 7:11 Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts£º
02Ex 7:12 Each one threw down his staff and it became a snake. But Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
02Ex 7:13 Yet Pharaoh's heart became hard and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.
02Ex 7:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.
02Ex 7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the water. Wait on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake.
02Ex 7:16 Then say to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you£º Let my people go, so that they may worship me in the desert. But until now you have not listened.
02Ex 7:17 This is what the LORD says£º By this you will know that I am the LORD£º With the staff that is in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.
02Ex 7:18 The fish in the Nile will die, and the river will stink; the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.'"
02Ex 7:19 The LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt--over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs'--and they will turn to blood. Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, even in the wooden buckets and stone jars."
02Ex 7:20 Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded. He raised his staff in the presence of Pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood.
02Ex 7:21 The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.
02Ex 7:22 But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, and Pharaoh's heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
02Ex 7:23 Instead, he turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart.
02Ex 7:24 And all the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river.
02Ex 7:25 Seven days passed after the LORD struck the Nile.
02Ex 8:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD says£º Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02Ex 8:2 If you refuse to let them go, I will plague your whole country with frogs.
02Ex 8:3 The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.
02Ex 8:4 The frogs will go up on you and your people and all your officials.'"
02Ex 8:5 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 8:6 So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.
02Ex 8:7 But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:8 Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Pray to the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD."
02Ex 8:9 Moses said to Pharaoh, "I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile."
02Ex 8:10 "Tomorrow," Pharaoh said. Moses replied, "It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the LORD our God.
02Ex 8:11 The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile."
02Ex 8:12 After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh.
02Ex 8:13 And the LORD did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields.
02Ex 8:14 They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.
02Ex 8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said.
02Ex 8:16 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,' and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats."
02Ex 8:17 They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came upon men and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats.
02Ex 8:18 But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. And the gnats were on men and animals.
02Ex 8:19 The magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." But Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the LORD had said.
02Ex 8:20 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the water and say to him, 'This is what the LORD says£º Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02Ex 8:21 If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the ground where they are.
02Ex 8:22 "'But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the LORD, am in this land.
02Ex 8:23 I will make a distinction between my people and your people. This miraculous sign will occur tomorrow.'"
02Ex 8:24 And the LORD did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh's palace and into the houses of his officials, and throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.
02Ex 8:25 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land."
02Ex 8:26 But Moses said, "That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the LORD our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?
02Ex 8:27 We must take a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, as he commands us."
02Ex 8:28 Pharaoh said, "I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God in the desert, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me."
02Ex 8:29 Moses answered, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only be sure that Pharaoh does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the LORD."
02Ex 8:30 Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD,
02Ex 8:31 and the LORD did what Moses asked£º The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained.
02Ex 8:32 But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go.
02Ex 9:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says£º "Let my people go, so that they may worship me."
02Ex 9:2 If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back,
02Ex 9:3 the hand of the LORD will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field--on your horses and donkeys and camels and on your cattle and sheep and goats.
02Ex 9:4 But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.'"
02Ex 9:5 The LORD set a time and said, "Tomorrow the LORD will do this in the land."
02Ex 9:6 And the next day the LORD did it£º All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.
02Ex 9:7 Pharaoh sent men to investigate and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go.
02Ex 9:8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.
02Ex 9:9 It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on men and animals throughout the land."
02Ex 9:10 So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on men and animals.
02Ex 9:11 The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians.
02Ex 9:12 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said to Moses.
02Ex 9:13 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says£º Let my people go, so that they may worship me,
02Ex 9:14 or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.
02Ex 9:15 For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth.
02Ex 9:16 But I have raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.
02Ex 9:17 You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go.
02Ex 9:18 Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now.
02Ex 9:19 Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every man and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.'"
02Ex 9:20 Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside.
02Ex 9:21 But those who ignored the word of the LORD left their slaves and livestock in the field.
02Ex 9:22 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt--on men and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt."
02Ex 9:23 When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt;
02Ex 9:24 hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation.
02Ex 9:25 Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields--both men and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree.
02Ex 9:26 The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.
02Ex 9:27 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. "This time I have sinned," he said to them. "The LORD is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.
02Ex 9:28 Pray to the LORD, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don't have to stay any longer."
02Ex 9:29 Moses replied, "When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the LORD. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the LORD'S.
02Ex 9:30 But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God."
02Ex 9:31 (The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom.
02Ex 9:32 The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)
02Ex 9:33 Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the LORD; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land.
02Ex 9:34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again£º He and his officials hardened their hearts.
02Ex 9:35 So Pharaoh's heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.
02Ex 10:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that I may perform these miraculous signs of mine among them
02Ex 10:2 that you may tell your children and grandchildren how I dealt harshly with the Egyptians and how I performed my signs among them, and that you may know that I am the LORD."
02Ex 10:3 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says£º 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people go, so that they may worship me.
02Ex 10:4 If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country tomorrow.
02Ex 10:5 They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including every tree that is growing in your fields.
02Ex 10:6 They will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the Egyptians--something neither your fathers nor your forefathers have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
02Ex 10:7 Pharaoh's officials said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the LORD their God. Do you not yet realize that Egypt is ruined?"
02Ex 10:8 Then Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "Go, worship the LORD your God," he said. "But just who will be going?"
02Ex 10:9 Moses answered, "We will go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we are to celebrate a festival to the LORD."
02Ex 10:10 Pharaoh said, "The LORD be with you--if I let you go, along with your women and children! Clearly you are bent on evil.
02Ex 10:11 No! Have only the men go; and worship the LORD, since that's what you have been asking for." Then Moses and Aaron were driven out of Pharaoh's presence.
02Ex 10:12 And the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that locusts will swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, everything left by the hail."
02Ex 10:13 So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt, and the LORD made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night. By morning the wind had brought the locusts;
02Ex 10:14 they invaded all Egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers. Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there ever be again.
02Ex 10:15 They covered all the ground until it was black. They devoured all that was left after the hail--everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees. Nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of Egypt.
02Ex 10:16 Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you.
02Ex 10:17 Now forgive my sin once more and pray to the LORD your God to take this deadly plague away from me."
02Ex 10:18 Moses then left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD.
02Ex 10:19 And the LORD changed the wind to a very strong west wind, which caught up the locusts and carried them into the Red Sea. Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt.
02Ex 10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go.
02Ex 10:21 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness will spread over Egypt--darkness that can be felt."
02Ex 10:22 So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.
02Ex 10:23 No one could see anyone else or leave his place for three days. Yet all the Israelites had light in the places where they lived.
02Ex 10:24 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, "Go, worship the LORD. Even your women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds behind."
02Ex 10:25 But Moses said, "You must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the LORD our God.
02Ex 10:26 Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshiping the LORD our God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the LORD."
02Ex 10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he was not willing to let them go.
02Ex 10:28 Pharaoh said to Moses, "Get out of my sight! Make sure you do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die."
02Ex 10:29 "Just as you say," Moses replied, "I will never appear before you again."
02Ex 11:1 Now the LORD had said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here, and when he does, he will drive you out completely.
02Ex 11:2 Tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold."
02Ex 11:3 (The LORD made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and Moses himself was highly regarded in Egypt by Pharaoh's officials and by the people.)
02Ex 11:4 So Moses said, "This is what the LORD says£º 'About midnight I will go throughout Egypt.
02Ex 11:5 Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn son of the slave girl, who is at her hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle as well.
02Ex 11:6 There will be loud wailing throughout Egypt--worse than there has ever been or ever will be again.
02Ex 11:7 But among the Israelites not a dog will bark at any man or animal.' Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.
02Ex 11:8 All these officials of yours will come to me, bowing down before me and saying, 'Go, you and all the people who follow you!' After that I will leave." Then Moses, hot with anger, left Pharaoh.
02Ex 11:9 The LORD had said to Moses, "Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you--so that my wonders may be multiplied in Egypt."
02Ex 11:10 Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his country.
02Ex 12:1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt,
02Ex 12:2 "This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year.
02Ex 12:3 Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.
02Ex 12:4 If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat.
02Ex 12:5 The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats.
02Ex 12:6 Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the people of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight.
02Ex 12:7 Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs.
02Ex 12:8 That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast.
02Ex 12:9 Do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water, but roast it over the fire--head, legs and inner parts.
02Ex 12:10 Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it.
02Ex 12:11 This is how you are to eat it£º with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the LORD'S Passover.
02Ex 12:12 "On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn--both men and animals--and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the LORD.
02Ex 12:13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt.
02Ex 12:14 "This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the LORD--a lasting ordinance.
02Ex 12:15 For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel.
02Ex 12:16 On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat--that is all you may do.
02Ex 12:17 "Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
02Ex 12:18 In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.
02Ex 12:19 For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And whoever eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel, whether he is an alien or native-born.
02Ex 12:20 Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread."
02Ex 12:21 Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb.
02Ex 12:22 Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. Not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning.
02Ex 12:23 When the LORD goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down.
02Ex 12:24 "Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants.
02Ex 12:25 When you enter the land that the LORD will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony.
02Ex 12:26 And when your children ask you, 'What does this ceremony mean to you?'
02Ex 12:27 then tell them, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped.
02Ex 12:28 The Israelites did just what the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 12:29 At midnight the LORD struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well.
02Ex 12:30 Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead.
02Ex 12:31 During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the LORD as you have requested.
02Ex 12:32 Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me."
02Ex 12:33 The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. "For otherwise," they said, "we will all die!"
02Ex 12:34 So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing.
02Ex 12:35 The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing.
02Ex 12:36 The LORD had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians.
02Ex 12:37 The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children.
02Ex 12:38 Many other people went up with them, as well as large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds.
02Ex 12:39 With the dough they had brought from Egypt, they baked cakes of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves.
02Ex 12:40 Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt was 430 years.
02Ex 12:41 At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the LORD'S divisions left Egypt.
02Ex 12:42 Because the LORD kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the LORD for the generations to come.
02Ex 12:43 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the regulations for the Passover£º "No foreigner is to eat of it.
02Ex 12:44 Any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him,
02Ex 12:45 but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it.
02Ex 12:46 "It must be eaten inside one house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones.
02Ex 12:47 The whole community of Israel must celebrate it.
02Ex 12:48 "An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the LORD'S Passover must have all the males in his household circumcised; then he may take part like one born in the land. No uncircumcised male may eat of it.
02Ex 12:49 The same law applies to the native-born and to the alien living among you."
02Ex 12:50 All the Israelites did just what the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 12:51 And on that very day the LORD brought the Israelites out of Egypt by their divisions.
02Ex 13:1 The LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 13:2 "Consecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether man or animal."
02Ex 13:3 Then Moses said to the people, "Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the LORD brought you out of it with a mighty hand. Eat nothing containing yeast.
02Ex 13:4 Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving.
02Ex 13:5 When the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites and Jebusites--the land he swore to your forefathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey--you are to observe this ceremony in this month£º
02Ex 13:6 For seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the LORD.
02Ex 13:7 Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.
02Ex 13:8 On that day tell your son, 'I do this because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.'
02Ex 13:9 This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.
02Ex 13:10 You must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year.
02Ex 13:11 "After the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as he promised on oath to you and your forefathers,
02Ex 13:12 you are to give over to the LORD the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the LORD.
02Ex 13:13 Redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons.
02Ex 13:14 "In days to come, when your son asks you, 'What does this mean?' say to him, 'With a mighty hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
02Ex 13:15 When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the LORD killed every firstborn in Egypt, both man and animal. This is why I sacrifice to the LORD the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.'
02Ex 13:16 And it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his mighty hand."
02Ex 13:17 When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, "If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt."
02Ex 13:18 So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt armed for battle.
02Ex 13:19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear an oath. He had said, "God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place."
02Ex 13:20 After leaving Succoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert.
02Ex 13:21 By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night.
02Ex 13:22 Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
02Ex 14:1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 14:2 "Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite Baal Zephon.
02Ex 14:3 Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert.'
02Ex 14:4 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD." So the Israelites did this.
02Ex 14:5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said, "What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and have lost their services!"
02Ex 14:6 So he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him.
02Ex 14:7 He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.
02Ex 14:8 The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.
02Ex 14:9 The Egyptians--all Pharaoh's horses and chariots, horsemen and troops--pursued the Israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near Pi Hahiroth, opposite Baal Zephon.
02Ex 14:10 As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the LORD.
02Ex 14:11 They said to Moses, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
02Ex 14:12 Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!"
02Ex 14:13 Moses answered the people, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.
02Ex 14:14 The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."
02Ex 14:15 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move on.
02Ex 14:16 Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
02Ex 14:17 I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.
02Ex 14:18 The Egyptians will know that I am the LORD when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen."
02Ex 14:19 Then the angel of God, who had been traveling in front of Israel's army, withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,
02Ex 14:20 coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side; so neither went near the other all night long.
02Ex 14:21 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the LORD drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,
02Ex 14:22 and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
02Ex 14:23 The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh's horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.
02Ex 14:24 During the last watch of the night the LORD looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.
02Ex 14:25 He made the wheels of their chariots come off so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, "Let's get away from the Israelites! The LORD is fighting for them against Egypt."
02Ex 14:26 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians and their chariots and horsemen."
02Ex 14:27 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing toward it, and the LORD swept them into the sea.
02Ex 14:28 The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen--the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
02Ex 14:29 But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
02Ex 14:30 That day the LORD saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.
02Ex 14:31 And when the Israelites saw the great power the LORD displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the LORD and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.
02Ex 15:1 Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the LORD£º "I will sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea.
02Ex 15:2 The LORD is my strength and my song; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father's God, and I will exalt him.
02Ex 15:3 The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is his name.
02Ex 15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea. The best of Pharaoh's officers are drowned in the Red Sea.
02Ex 15:5 The deep waters have covered them; they sank to the depths like a stone.
02Ex 15:6 "Your right hand, O LORD, was majestic in power. Your right hand, O LORD, shattered the enemy.
02Ex 15:7 In the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you. You unleashed your burning anger; it consumed them like stubble.
02Ex 15:8 By the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up. The surging waters stood firm like a wall; the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
02Ex 15:9 "The enemy boasted, 'I will pursue, I will overtake them. I will divide the spoils; I will gorge myself on them. I will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them.'
02Ex 15:10 But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
02Ex 15:11 "Who among the gods is like you, O LORD? Who is like you--majestic in holiness, awesome in glory, working wonders?
02Ex 15:12 You stretched out your right hand and the earth swallowed them.
02Ex 15:13 "In your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling.
02Ex 15:14 The nations will hear and tremble; anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
02Ex 15:15 The chiefs of Edom will be terrified, the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling, the people of Canaan will melt away;
02Ex 15:16 terror and dread will fall upon them. By the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone--until your people pass by, O LORD, until the people you bought pass by.
02Ex 15:17 You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance--the place, O LORD, you made for your dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, your hands established.
02Ex 15:18 The LORD will reign for ever and ever."
02Ex 15:19 When Pharaoh's horses, chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the LORD brought the waters of the sea back over them, but the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
02Ex 15:20 Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women followed her, with tambourines and dancing.
02Ex 15:21 Miriam sang to them£º "Sing to the LORD, for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea."
02Ex 15:22 Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur. For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.
02Ex 15:23 When they came to Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called Marah.)
02Ex 15:24 So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, "What are we to drink?"
02Ex 15:25 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. He threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There the LORD made a decree and a law for them, and there he tested them.
02Ex 15:26 He said, "If you listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you."
02Ex 15:27 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there near the water.
02Ex 16:1 The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of Egypt.
02Ex 16:2 In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 16:3 The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the LORD'S hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death."
02Ex 16:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions.
02Ex 16:5 On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days."
02Ex 16:6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, "In the evening you will know that it was the LORD who brought you out of Egypt,
02Ex 16:7 and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?"
02Ex 16:8 Moses also said, "You will know that it was the LORD when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because he has heard your grumbling against him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the LORD."
02Ex 16:9 Then Moses told Aaron, "Say to the entire Israelite community, 'Come before the LORD, for he has heard your grumbling.'"
02Ex 16:10 While Aaron was speaking to the whole Israelite community, they looked toward the desert, and there was the glory of the LORD appearing in the cloud.
02Ex 16:11 The LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 16:12 "I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them, 'At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.'"
02Ex 16:13 That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.
02Ex 16:14 When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor.
02Ex 16:15 When the Israelites saw it, they said to each other, "What is it?" For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, "It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat.
02Ex 16:16 This is what the LORD has commanded£º 'Each one is to gather as much as he needs. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent.'"
02Ex 16:17 The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered much, some little.
02Ex 16:18 And when they measured it by the omer, he who gathered much did not have too much, and he who gathered little did not have too little. Each one gathered as much as he needed.
02Ex 16:19 Then Moses said to them, "No one is to keep any of it until morning."
02Ex 16:20 However, some of them paid no attention to Moses; they kept part of it until morning, but it was full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.
02Ex 16:21 Each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.
02Ex 16:22 On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much--two omers for each person--and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.
02Ex 16:23 He said to them, "This is what the LORD commanded£º 'Tomorrow is to be a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD. So bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.'"
02Ex 16:24 So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.
02Ex 16:25 "Eat it today," Moses said, "because today is a Sabbath to the LORD. You will not find any of it on the ground today.
02Ex 16:26 Six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any."
02Ex 16:27 Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.
02Ex 16:28 Then the LORD said to Moses, "How long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions?
02Ex 16:29 Bear in mind that the LORD has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day; no one is to go out."
02Ex 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.
02Ex 16:31 The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.
02Ex 16:32 Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded£º 'Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the desert when I brought you out of Egypt.'"
02Ex 16:33 So Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the LORD to be kept for the generations to come."
02Ex 16:34 As the LORD commanded Moses, Aaron put the manna in front of the Testimony, that it might be kept.
02Ex 16:35 The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.
02Ex 16:36 (An omer is one tenth of an ephah.)
02Ex 17:1 The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the LORD commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
02Ex 17:2 So they quarreled with Moses and said, "Give us water to drink." Moses replied, "Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the LORD to the test?"
02Ex 17:3 But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, "Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?"
02Ex 17:4 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, "What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me."
02Ex 17:5 The LORD answered Moses, "Walk on ahead of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.
02Ex 17:6 I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink." So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.
02Ex 17:7 And he called the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the LORD saying, "Is the LORD among us or not?"
02Ex 17:8 The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.
02Ex 17:9 Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands."
02Ex 17:10 So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.
02Ex 17:11 As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.
02Ex 17:12 When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up--one on one side, one on the other--so that his hands remained steady till sunset.
02Ex 17:13 So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.
02Ex 17:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven."
02Ex 17:15 Moses built an altar and called it The LORD is my Banner.
02Ex 17:16 He said, "For hands were lifted up to the throne of the LORD. The LORD will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation."
02Ex 18:1 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt.
02Ex 18:2 After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her
02Ex 18:3 and her two sons. One son was named Gershom, for Moses said, "I have become an alien in a foreign land";
02Ex 18:4 and the other was named Eliezer, for he said, "My father's God was my helper; he saved me from the sword of Pharaoh."
02Ex 18:5 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, together with Moses' sons and wife, came to him in the desert, where he was camped near the mountain of God.
02Ex 18:6 Jethro had sent word to him, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons."
02Ex 18:7 So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and then went into the tent.
02Ex 18:8 Moses told his father-in-law about everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel's sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the LORD had saved them.
02Ex 18:9 Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.
02Ex 18:10 He said, "Praise be to the LORD, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.
02Ex 18:11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all other gods, for he did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly."
02Ex 18:12 Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.
02Ex 18:13 The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.
02Ex 18:14 When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, "What is this you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit as judge, while all these people stand around you from morning till evening?"
02Ex 18:15 Moses answered him, "Because the people come to me to seek God's will.
02Ex 18:16 Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God's decrees and laws."
02Ex 18:17 Moses' father-in-law replied, "What you are doing is not good.
02Ex 18:18 You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy for you; you cannot handle it alone.
02Ex 18:19 Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people's representative before God and bring their disputes to him.
02Ex 18:20 Teach them the decrees and laws, and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform.
02Ex 18:21 But select capable men from all the people--men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain--and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
02Ex 18:22 Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but have them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you.
02Ex 18:23 If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied."
02Ex 18:24 Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.
02Ex 18:25 He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.
02Ex 18:26 They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.
02Ex 18:27 Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own country.
02Ex 19:1 In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt--on the very day--they came to the Desert of Sinai.
02Ex 19:2 After they set out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain.
02Ex 19:3 Then Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain and said, "This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and what you are to tell the people of Israel£º
02Ex 19:4 'You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
02Ex 19:5 Now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession. Although the whole earth is mine,
02Ex 19:6 you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites."
02Ex 19:7 So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the LORD had commanded him to speak.
02Ex 19:8 The people all responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has said." So Moses brought their answer back to the LORD.
02Ex 19:9 The LORD said to Moses, "I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you." Then Moses told the LORD what the people had said.
02Ex 19:10 And the LORD said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
02Ex 19:11 and be ready by the third day, because on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
02Ex 19:12 Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, 'Be careful that you do not go up the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.
02Ex 19:13 He shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on him. Whether man or animal, he shall not be permitted to live.' Only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast may they go up to the mountain."
02Ex 19:14 After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.
02Ex 19:15 Then he said to the people, "Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations."
02Ex 19:16 On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.
02Ex 19:17 Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
02Ex 19:18 Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain trembled violently,
02Ex 19:19 and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.
02Ex 19:20 The LORD descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up
02Ex 19:21 and the LORD said to him, "Go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the LORD and many of them perish.
02Ex 19:22 Even the priests, who approach the LORD, must consecrate themselves, or the LORD will break out against them."
02Ex 19:23 Moses said to the LORD, "The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, 'Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.'"
02Ex 19:24 The LORD replied, "Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the LORD, or he will break out against them."
02Ex 19:25 So Moses went down to the people and told them.
02Ex 20:1 And God spoke all these words£º
02Ex 20:2 "I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
02Ex 20:3 "You shall have no other gods before me.
02Ex 20:4 "You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
02Ex 20:5 You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me,
02Ex 20:6 but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.
02Ex 20:7 "You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name.
02Ex 20:8 "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
02Ex 20:9 Six days you shall labor and do all your work,
02Ex 20:10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates.
02Ex 20:11 For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
02Ex 20:12 "Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
02Ex 20:13 "You shall not murder.
02Ex 20:14 "You shall not commit adultery.
02Ex 20:15 "You shall not steal.
02Ex 20:16 "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
02Ex 20:17 "You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
02Ex 20:18 When the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance
02Ex 20:19 and said to Moses, "Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us or we will die."
02Ex 20:20 Moses said to the people, "Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning."
02Ex 20:21 The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.
02Ex 20:22 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites this£º 'You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven£º
02Ex 20:23 Do not make any gods to be alongside me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.
02Ex 20:24 "'Make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you.
02Ex 20:25 If you make an altar of stones for me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it.
02Ex 20:26 And do not go up to my altar on steps, lest your nakedness be exposed on it.'
02Ex 21:1 "These are the laws you are to set before them£º
02Ex 21:2 "If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything.
02Ex 21:3 If he comes alone, he is to go free alone; but if he has a wife when he comes, she is to go with him.
02Ex 21:4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall belong to her master, and only the man shall go free.
02Ex 21:5 "But if the servant declares, 'I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,'
02Ex 21:6 then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life.
02Ex 21:7 "If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as menservants do.
02Ex 21:8 If she does not please the master who has selected her for himself, he must let her be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has broken faith with her.
02Ex 21:9 If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter.
02Ex 21:10 If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights.
02Ex 21:11 If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without any payment of money.
02Ex 21:12 "Anyone who strikes a man and kills him shall surely be put to death.
02Ex 21:13 However, if he does not do it intentionally, but God lets it happen, he is to flee to a place I will designate.
02Ex 21:14 But if a man schemes and kills another man deliberately, take him away from my altar and put him to death.
02Ex 21:15 "Anyone who attacks his father or his mother must be put to death.
02Ex 21:16 "Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death.
02Ex 21:17 "Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.
02Ex 21:18 "If men quarrel and one hits the other with a stone or with his fist and he does not die but is confined to bed,
02Ex 21:19 the one who struck the blow will not be held responsible if the other gets up and walks around outside with his staff; however, he must pay the injured man for the loss of his time and see that he is completely healed.
02Ex 21:20 "If a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result, he must be punished,
02Ex 21:21 but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two, since the slave is his property.
02Ex 21:22 "If men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the court allows.
02Ex 21:23 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life,
02Ex 21:24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
02Ex 21:25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.
02Ex 21:26 "If a man hits a manservant or maidservant in the eye and destroys it, he must let the servant go free to compensate for the eye.
02Ex 21:27 And if he knocks out the tooth of a manservant or maidservant, he must let the servant go free to compensate for the tooth.
02Ex 21:28 "If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull must be stoned to death, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner of the bull will not be held responsible.
02Ex 21:29 If, however, the bull has had the habit of goring and the owner has been warned but has not kept it penned up and it kills a man or woman, the bull must be stoned and the owner also must be put to death.
02Ex 21:30 However, if payment is demanded of him, he may redeem his life by paying whatever is demanded.
02Ex 21:31 This law also applies if the bull gores a son or daughter.
02Ex 21:32 If the bull gores a male or female slave, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of the slave, and the bull must be stoned.
02Ex 21:33 "If a man uncovers a pit or digs one and fails to cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it,
02Ex 21:34 the owner of the pit must pay for the loss; he must pay its owner, and the dead animal will be his.
02Ex 21:35 "If a man's bull injures the bull of another and it dies, they are to sell the live one and divide both the money and the dead animal equally.
02Ex 21:36 However, if it was known that the bull had the habit of goring, yet the owner did not keep it penned up, the owner must pay, animal for animal, and the dead animal will be his.
02Ex 22:1 "If a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, he must pay back five head of cattle for the ox and four sheep for the sheep.
02Ex 22:2 "If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed;
02Ex 22:3 but if it happens after sunrise, he is guilty of bloodshed. "A thief must certainly make restitution, but if he has nothing, he must be sold to pay for his theft.
02Ex 22:4 "If the stolen animal is found alive in his possession--whether ox or donkey or sheep--he must pay back double.
02Ex 22:5 "If a man grazes his livestock in a field or vineyard and lets them stray and they graze in another man's field, he must make restitution from the best of his own field or vineyard.
02Ex 22:6 "If a fire breaks out and spreads into thornbushes so that it burns shocks of grain or standing grain or the whole field, the one who started the fire must make restitution.
02Ex 22:7 "If a man gives his neighbor silver or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen from the neighbor's house, the thief, if he is caught, must pay back double.
02Ex 22:8 But if the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine whether he has laid his hands on the other man's property.
02Ex 22:9 In all cases of illegal possession of an ox, a donkey, a sheep, a garment, or any other lost property about which somebody says, 'This is mine,' both parties are to bring their cases before the judges. The one whom the judges declare guilty must pay back double to his neighbor.
02Ex 22:10 "If a man gives a donkey, an ox, a sheep or any other animal to his neighbor for safekeeping and it dies or is injured or is taken away while no one is looking,
02Ex 22:11 the issue between them will be settled by the taking of an oath before the LORD that the neighbor did not lay hands on the other person's property. The owner is to accept this, and no restitution is required.
02Ex 22:12 But if the animal was stolen from the neighbor, he must make restitution to the owner.
02Ex 22:13 If it was torn to pieces by a wild animal, he shall bring in the remains as evidence and he will not be required to pay for the torn animal.
02Ex 22:14 "If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, he must make restitution.
02Ex 22:15 But if the owner is with the animal, the borrower will not have to pay. If the animal was hired, the money paid for the hire covers the loss.
02Ex 22:16 "If a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her, he must pay the bride-price, and she shall be his wife.
02Ex 22:17 If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must still pay the bride-price for virgins.
02Ex 22:18 "Do not allow a sorceress to live.
02Ex 22:19 "Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must be put to death.
02Ex 22:20 "Whoever sacrifices to any god other than the LORD must be destroyed.
02Ex 22:21 "Do not mistreat an alien or oppress him, for you were aliens in Egypt.
02Ex 22:22 "Do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan.
02Ex 22:23 If you do and they cry out to me, I will certainly hear their cry.
02Ex 22:24 My anger will be aroused, and I will kill you with the sword; your wives will become widows and your children fatherless.
02Ex 22:25 "If you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not be like a moneylender; charge him no interest.
02Ex 22:26 If you take your neighbor's cloak as a pledge, return it to him by sunset,
02Ex 22:27 because his cloak is the only covering he has for his body. What else will he sleep in? When he cries out to me, I will hear, for I am compassionate.
02Ex 22:28 "Do not blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people.
02Ex 22:29 "Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or your vats."You must give me the firstborn of your sons.
02Ex 22:30 Do the same with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but give them to me on the eighth day.
02Ex 22:31 "You are to be my holy people. So do not eat the meat of an animal torn by wild beasts; throw it to the dogs.
02Ex 23:1 "Do not spread false reports. Do not help a wicked man by being a malicious witness.
02Ex 23:2 "Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you give testimony in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the crowd,
02Ex 23:3 and do not show favoritism to a poor man in his lawsuit.
02Ex 23:4 "If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to take it back to him.
02Ex 23:5 If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen down under its load, do not leave it there; be sure you help him with it.
02Ex 23:6 "Do not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.
02Ex 23:7 Have nothing to do with a false charge and do not put an innocent or honest person to death, for I will not acquit the guilty.
02Ex 23:8 "Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds those who see and twists the words of the righteous.
02Ex 23:9 "Do not oppress an alien; you yourselves know how it feels to be aliens, because you were aliens in Egypt.
02Ex 23:10 "For six years you are to sow your fields and harvest the crops,
02Ex 23:11 but during the seventh year let the land lie unplowed and unused. Then the poor among your people may get food from it, and the wild animals may eat what they leave. Do the same with your vineyard and your olive grove.
02Ex 23:12 "Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work, so that your ox and your donkey may rest and the slave born in your household, and the alien as well, may be refreshed.
02Ex 23:13 "Be careful to do everything I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of other gods; do not let them be heard on your lips.
02Ex 23:14 "Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival to me.
02Ex 23:15 "Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread; for seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in that month you came out of Egypt. "No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
02Ex 23:16 "Celebrate the Feast of Harvest with the firstfruits of the crops you sow in your field. "Celebrate the Feast of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in your crops from the field.
02Ex 23:17 "Three times a year all the men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD.
02Ex 23:18 "Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast. "The fat of my festival offerings must not be kept until morning.
02Ex 23:19 "Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. "Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
02Ex 23:20 "See, I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared.
02Ex 23:21 Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since my Name is in him.
02Ex 23:22 If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you.
02Ex 23:23 My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.
02Ex 23:24 Do not bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces.
02Ex 23:25 Worship the LORD your God, and his blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away sickness from among you,
02Ex 23:26 and none will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will give you a full life span.
02Ex 23:27 "I will send my terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs and run.
02Ex 23:28 I will send the hornet ahead of you to drive the Hivites, Canaanites and Hittites out of your way.
02Ex 23:29 But I will not drive them out in a single year, because the land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you.
02Ex 23:30 Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you have increased enough to take possession of the land.
02Ex 23:31 "I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the River. I will hand over to you the people who live in the land and you will drive them out before you.
02Ex 23:32 Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods.
02Ex 23:33 Do not let them live in your land, or they will cause you to sin against me, because the worship of their gods will certainly be a snare to you."
02Ex 24:1 Then he said to Moses, "Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. You are to worship at a distance,
02Ex 24:2 but Moses alone is to approach the LORD; the others must not come near. And the people may not come up with him."
02Ex 24:3 When Moses went and told the people all the LORD'S words and laws, they responded with one voice, "Everything the LORD has said we will do."
02Ex 24:4 Moses then wrote down everything the LORD had said. He got up early the next morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel.
02Ex 24:5 Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings to the LORD.
02Ex 24:6 Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and the other half he sprinkled on the altar.
02Ex 24:7 Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They responded, "We will do everything the LORD has said; we will obey."
02Ex 24:8 Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people and said, "This is the blood of the covenant that the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words."
02Ex 24:9 Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up
02Ex 24:10 and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of sapphire, clear as the sky itself.
02Ex 24:11 But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and drank.
02Ex 24:12 The LORD said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone, with the law and commands I have written for their instruction."
02Ex 24:13 Then Moses set out with Joshua his aide, and Moses went up on the mountain of God.
02Ex 24:14 He said to the elders, "Wait here for us until we come back to you. Aaron and Hur are with you, and anyone involved in a dispute can go to them."
02Ex 24:15 When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it,
02Ex 24:16 and the glory of the LORD settled on Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud covered the mountain, and on the seventh day the LORD called to Moses from within the cloud.
02Ex 24:17 To the Israelites the glory of the LORD looked like a consuming fire on top of the mountain.
02Ex 24:18 Then Moses entered the cloud as he went on up the mountain. And he stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
02Ex 25:1 The LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 25:2 "Tell the Israelites to bring me an offering. You are to receive the offering for me from each man whose heart prompts him to give.
02Ex 25:3 These are the offerings you are to receive from them£º gold, silver and bronze;
02Ex 25:4 blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair;
02Ex 25:5 ram skins dyed red and hides of sea cows; acacia wood;
02Ex 25:6 olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
02Ex 25:7 and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
02Ex 25:8 "Then have them make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell among them.
02Ex 25:9 Make this tabernacle and all its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.
02Ex 25:10 "Have them make a chest of acacia wood--two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
02Ex 25:11 Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out, and make a gold molding around it.
02Ex 25:12 Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.
02Ex 25:13 Then make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.

02Ex 31:9 the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, the basin with its stand--
02Ex 31:10 and also the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,
02Ex 31:11 and the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you."
02Ex 31:12 Then the LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 31:13 "Say to the Israelites, 'You must observe my Sabbaths. This will be a sign between me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.
02Ex 31:14 "'Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from his people.
02Ex 31:15 For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.
02Ex 31:16 The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.
02Ex 31:17 It will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested.'"
02Ex 31:18 When the LORD finished speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.
02Ex 32:1 When the people saw that Moses was so long in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, "Come, make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him."
02Ex 32:2 Aaron answered them, "Take off the gold earrings that your wives, your sons and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me."
02Ex 32:3 So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.
02Ex 32:4 He took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf, fashioning it with a tool. Then they said, "These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt."
02Ex 32:5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, "Tomorrow there will be a festival to the LORD."
02Ex 32:6 So the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings. Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.
02Ex 32:7 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt.
02Ex 32:8 They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.'
02Ex 32:9 "I have seen these people," the LORD said to Moses, "and they are a stiff-necked people.
02Ex 32:10 Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation."
02Ex 32:11 But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. "O LORD," he said, "why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?
02Ex 32:12 Why should the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people.
02Ex 32:13 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self£º 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'"
02Ex 32:14 Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.
02Ex 32:15 Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.
02Ex 32:16 The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
02Ex 32:17 When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, "There is the sound of war in the camp."
02Ex 32:18 Moses replied£º "It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear."
02Ex 32:19 When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain.
02Ex 32:20 And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.
02Ex 32:21 He said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?"
02Ex 32:22 "Do not be angry, my lord," Aaron answered. "You know how prone these people are to evil.
02Ex 32:23 They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.'
02Ex 32:24 So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!"
02Ex 32:25 Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies.
02Ex 32:26 So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, "Whoever is for the LORD, come to me." And all the Levites rallied to him.
02Ex 32:27 Then he said to them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'"
02Ex 32:28 The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.
02Ex 32:29 Then Moses said, "You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day."
02Ex 32:30 The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
02Ex 32:31 So Moses went back to the LORD and said, "Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.
02Ex 32:32 But now, please forgive their sin--but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written."
02Ex 32:33 The LORD replied to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.
02Ex 32:34 Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin."
02Ex 32:35 And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
02Ex 33:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go up to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your descendants.'
02Ex 33:2 I will send an angel before you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
02Ex 33:3 Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way."
02Ex 33:4 When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments.
02Ex 33:5 For the LORD had said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites, 'You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.'"
02Ex 33:6 So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.
02Ex 33:7 Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away, calling it the "tent of meeting." Anyone inquiring of the LORD would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp.
02Ex 33:8 And whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.
02Ex 33:9 As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance, while the LORD spoke with Moses.
02Ex 33:10 Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at the entrance to his tent.
02Ex 33:11 The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.
02Ex 33:12 Moses said to the LORD, "You have been telling me, 'Lead these people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. You have said, 'I know you by name and you have found favor with me.'
02Ex 33:13 If you are pleased with me, teach me your ways so I may know you and continue to find favor with you. Remember that this nation is your people."
02Ex 33:14 The LORD replied, "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."
02Ex 33:15 Then Moses said to him, "If your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.
02Ex 33:16 How will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us? What else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?"
02Ex 33:17 And the LORD said to Moses, "I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name."
02Ex 33:18 Then Moses said, "Now show me your glory."
02Ex 33:19 And the LORD said, "I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the LORD, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
02Ex 33:20 But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live."
02Ex 33:21 Then the LORD said, "There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock.
02Ex 33:22 When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
02Ex 33:23 Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen."
02Ex 34:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.
02Ex 34:2 Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain.
02Ex 34:3 No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain."
02Ex 34:4 So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the LORD had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands.
02Ex 34:5 Then the LORD came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the LORD.
02Ex 34:6 And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, "The LORD, the LORD, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,
02Ex 34:7 maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation."
02Ex 34:8 Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped.
02Ex 34:9 "O Lord, if I have found favor in your eyes," he said, "then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance."
02Ex 34:10 Then the LORD said£º "I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the LORD, will do for you.
02Ex 34:11 Obey what I command you today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
02Ex 34:12 Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will be a snare among you.
02Ex 34:13 Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.
02Ex 34:14 Do not worship any other god, for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.
02Ex 34:15 "Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.
02Ex 34:16 And when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same.
02Ex 34:17 "Do not make cast idols.
02Ex 34:18 "Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in that month you came out of Egypt.
02Ex 34:19 "The first offspring of every womb belongs to me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether from herd or flock.
02Ex 34:20 Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. "No one is to appear before me empty-handed.
02Ex 34:21 "Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest.
02Ex 34:22 "Celebrate the Feast of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the turn of the year.
02Ex 34:23 Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign LORD, the God of Israel.
02Ex 34:24 I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the LORD your God.
02Ex 34:25 "Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the sacrifice from the Passover Feast remain until morning.
02Ex 34:26 "Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the LORD your God. "Do not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."
02Ex 34:27 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel."
02Ex 34:28 Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant--the Ten Commandments.
02Ex 34:29 When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD.
02Ex 34:30 When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.
02Ex 34:31 But Moses called to them; so Aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him, and he spoke to them.
02Ex 34:32 Afterward all the Israelites came near him, and he gave them all the commands the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai.
02Ex 34:33 When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face.
02Ex 34:34 But whenever he entered the LORD'S presence to speak with him, he removed the veil until he came out. And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded,
02Ex 34:35 they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the LORD.
02Ex 35:1 Moses assembled the whole Israelite community and said to them, "These are the things the LORD has commanded you to do£º
02Ex 35:2 For six days, work is to be done, but the seventh day shall be your holy day, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it must be put to death.
02Ex 35:3 Do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day."
02Ex 35:4 Moses said to the whole Israelite community, "This is what the LORD has commanded£º
02Ex 35:5 From what you have, take an offering for the LORD. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the LORD an offering of gold, silver and bronze;
02Ex 35:6 blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair;
02Ex 35:7 ram skins dyed red and hides of sea cows; acacia wood;
02Ex 35:8 olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;
02Ex 35:9 and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
02Ex 35:10 "All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the LORD has commanded£º
02Ex 35:11 the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;
02Ex 35:12 the ark with its poles and the atonement cover and the curtain that shields it;
02Ex 35:13 the table with its poles and all its articles and the bread of the Presence;
02Ex 35:14 the lampstand that is for light with its accessories, lamps and oil for the light;
02Ex 35:15 the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle;
02Ex 35:16 the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the bronze basin with its stand;
02Ex 35:17 the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;
02Ex 35:18 the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes;
02Ex 35:19 the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary--both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests."
02Ex 35:20 Then the whole Israelite community withdrew from Moses' presence,
02Ex 35:21 and everyone who was willing and whose heart moved him came and brought an offering to the LORD for the work on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.
02Ex 35:22 All who were willing, men and women alike, came and brought gold jewelry of all kinds£º brooches, earrings, rings and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the LORD.
02Ex 35:23 Everyone who had blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen, or goat hair, ram skins dyed red or hides of sea cows brought them.
02Ex 35:24 Those presenting an offering of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the LORD, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.
02Ex 35:25 Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun--blue, purple or scarlet yarn or fine linen.
02Ex 35:26 And all the women who were willing and had the skill spun the goat hair.
02Ex 35:27 The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.
02Ex 35:28 They also brought spices and olive oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.
02Ex 35:29 All the Israelite men and women who were willing brought to the LORD freewill offerings for all the work the LORD through Moses had commanded them to do.
02Ex 35:30 Then Moses said to the Israelites, "See, the LORD has chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,
02Ex 35:31 and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability and knowledge in all kinds of crafts--
02Ex 35:32 to make artistic designs for work in gold, silver and bronze,
02Ex 35:33 to cut and set stones, to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of artistic craftsmanship.
02Ex 35:34 And he has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.
02Ex 35:35 He has filled them with skill to do all kinds of work as craftsmen, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen, and weavers--all of them master craftsmen and designers.
02Ex 36:1 So Bezalel, Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD has given skill and ability to know how to carry out all the work of constructing the sanctuary are to do the work just as the LORD has commanded."
02Ex 36:2 Then Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person to whom the LORD had given ability and who was willing to come and do the work.
02Ex 36:3 They received from Moses all the offerings the Israelites had brought to carry out the work of constructing the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.
02Ex 36:4 So all the skilled craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left their work
02Ex 36:5 and said to Moses, "The people are bringing more than enough for doing the work the LORD commanded to be done."
02Ex 36:6 Then Moses gave an order and they sent this word throughout the camp£º "No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary." And so the people were restrained from bringing more,
02Ex 36:7 because what they already had was more than enough to do all the work.
02Ex 36:8 All the skilled men among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim worked into them by a skilled craftsman.
02Ex 36:9 All the curtains were the same size--twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.
02Ex 36:10 They joined five of the curtains together and did the same with the other five.
02Ex 36:11 Then they made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set.
02Ex 36:12 They also made fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the other set, with the loops opposite each other.
02Ex 36:13 Then they made fifty gold clasps and used them to fasten the two sets of curtains together so that the tabernacle was a unit.
02Ex 36:14 They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle--eleven altogether.
02Ex 36:15 All eleven curtains were the same size--thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.
02Ex 36:16 They joined five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set.
02Ex 36:17 Then they made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and also along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.
02Ex 36:18 They made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the tent together as a unit.
02Ex 36:19 Then they made for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of hides of sea cows.
02Ex 36:20 They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.
02Ex 36:21 Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,
02Ex 36:22 with two projections set parallel to each other. They made all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.
02Ex 36:23 They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle
02Ex 36:24 and made forty silver bases to go under them--two bases for each frame, one under each projection.
02Ex 36:25 For the other side, the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames
02Ex 36:26 and forty silver bases--two under each frame.
02Ex 36:27 They made six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,
02Ex 36:28 and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end.
02Ex 36:29 At these two corners the frames were double from the bottom all the way to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike.
02Ex 36:30 So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases--two under each frame.
02Ex 36:31 They also made crossbars of acacia wood£º five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,
02Ex 36:32 five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.
02Ex 36:33 They made the center crossbar so that it extended from end to end at the middle of the frames.
02Ex 36:34 They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. They also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
02Ex 36:35 They made the curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim worked into it by a skilled craftsman.
02Ex 36:36 They made four posts of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold. They made gold hooks for them and cast their four silver bases.
02Ex 36:37 For the entrance to the tent they made a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen--the work of an embroiderer;
02Ex 36:38 and they made five posts with hooks for them. They overlaid the tops of the posts and their bands with gold and made their five bases of bronze.
02Ex 37:1 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood--two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.
02Ex 37:2 He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it.
02Ex 37:3 He cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.
02Ex 37:4 Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:5 And he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.
02Ex 37:6 He made the atonement cover of pure gold--two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.
02Ex 37:7 Then he made two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.
02Ex 37:8 He made one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; at the two ends he made them of one piece with the cover.
02Ex 37:9 The cherubim had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the cover.
02Ex 37:10 They made the table of acacia wood--two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.
02Ex 37:11 Then they overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.
02Ex 37:12 They also made around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.
02Ex 37:13 They cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners, where the four legs were.
02Ex 37:14 The rings were put close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.
02Ex 37:15 The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were overlaid with gold.
02Ex 37:16 And they made from pure gold the articles for the table--its plates and dishes and bowls and its pitchers for the pouring out of drink offerings.
02Ex 37:17 They made the lampstand of pure gold and hammered it out, base and shaft; its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms were of one piece with it.
02Ex 37:18 Six branches extended from the sides of the lampstand--three on one side and three on the other.
02Ex 37:19 Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms were on one branch, three on the next branch and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.
02Ex 37:20 And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.
02Ex 37:21 One bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair--six branches in all.
02Ex 37:22 The buds and the branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.
02Ex 37:23 They made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold.
02Ex 37:24 They made the lampstand and all its accessories from one talent of pure gold.
02Ex 37:25 They made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square, a cubit long and a cubit wide, and two cubits high--its horns of one piece with it.
02Ex 37:26 They overlaid the top and all the sides and the horns with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it.
02Ex 37:27 They made two gold rings below the molding--two on opposite sides--to hold the poles used to carry it.
02Ex 37:28 They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:29 They also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense--the work of a perfumer.
02Ex 38:1 They built the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood, three cubits high; it was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide.
02Ex 38:2 They made a horn at each of the four corners, so that the horns and the altar were of one piece, and they overlaid the altar with bronze.
02Ex 38:3 They made all its utensils of bronze--its pots, shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks and firepans.
02Ex 38:4 They made a grating for the altar, a bronze network, to be under its ledge, halfway up the altar.
02Ex 38:5 They cast bronze rings to hold the poles for the four corners of the bronze grating.
02Ex 38:6 They made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
02Ex 38:7 They inserted the poles into the rings so they would be on the sides of the altar for carrying it. They made it hollow, out of boards.
02Ex 38:8 They made the bronze basin and its bronze stand from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
02Ex 38:9 Next they made the courtyard. The south side was a hundred cubits long and had curtains of finely twisted linen,
02Ex 38:10 with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
02Ex 38:11 The north side was also a hundred cubits long and had twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
02Ex 38:12 The west end was fifty cubits wide and had curtains, with ten posts and ten bases, with silver hooks and bands on the posts.
02Ex 38:13 The east end, toward the sunrise, was also fifty cubits wide.
02Ex 38:14 Curtains fifteen cubits long were on one side of the entrance, with three posts and three bases,
02Ex 38:15 and curtains fifteen cubits long were on the other side of the entrance to the courtyard, with three posts and three bases.
02Ex 38:16 All the curtains around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen.
02Ex 38:17 The bases for the posts were bronze. The hooks and bands on the posts were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver; so all the posts of the courtyard had silver bands.
02Ex 38:18 The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen--the work of an embroiderer. It was twenty cubits long and, like the curtains of the courtyard, five cubits high,
02Ex 38:19 with four posts and four bronze bases. Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver.
02Ex 38:20 All the tent pegs of the tabernacle and of the surrounding courtyard were bronze.
02Ex 38:21 These are the amounts of the materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, which were recorded at Moses' command by the Levites under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
02Ex 38:22 (Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the LORD commanded Moses;
02Ex 38:23 with him was Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan--a craftsman and designer, and an embroiderer in blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen.)
02Ex 38:24 The total amount of the gold from the wave offering used for all the work on the sanctuary was 29 talents and 730 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
02Ex 38:25 The silver obtained from those of the community who were counted in the census was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel--
02Ex 38:26 one beka per person, that is, half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, from everyone who had crossed over to those counted, twenty years old or more, a total of 603,550 men.
02Ex 38:27 The 100 talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and for the curtain--100 bases from the 100 talents, one talent for each base.
02Ex 38:28 They used the 1,775 shekels to make the hooks for the posts, to overlay the tops of the posts, and to make their bands.
02Ex 38:29 The bronze from the wave offering was 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.
02Ex 38:30 They used it to make the bases for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all its utensils,
02Ex 38:31 the bases for the surrounding courtyard and those for its entrance and all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and those for the surrounding courtyard.
02Ex 39:1 From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:2 They made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.
02Ex 39:3 They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen--the work of a skilled craftsman.
02Ex 39:4 They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened.
02Ex 39:5 Its skillfully woven waistband was like it--of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:6 They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel.
02Ex 39:7 Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:8 They fashioned the breastpiece--the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod£º of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.
02Ex 39:9 It was square--a span long and a span wide--and folded double.
02Ex 39:10 Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. In the first row there was a ruby, a topaz and a beryl;
02Ex 39:11 in the second row a turquoise, a sapphire and an emerald;
02Ex 39:12 in the third row a jacinth, an agate and an amethyst;
02Ex 39:13 in the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx and a jasper. They were mounted in gold filigree settings.
02Ex 39:14 There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes.
02Ex 39:15 For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope.
02Ex 39:16 They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece.
02Ex 39:17 They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,
02Ex 39:18 and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.
02Ex 39:19 They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod.
02Ex 39:20 Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod.
02Ex 39:21 They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod--as the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:22 They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth--the work of a weaver--
02Ex 39:23 with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar, and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear.
02Ex 39:24 They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe.
02Ex 39:25 And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates.
02Ex 39:26 The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:27 For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen--the work of a weaver--
02Ex 39:28 and the turban of fine linen, the linen headbands and the undergarments of finely twisted linen.
02Ex 39:29 The sash was of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn--the work of an embroiderer--as the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:30 They made the plate, the sacred diadem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal£º HOLY TO THE LORD.
02Ex 39:31 Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:32 So all the work on the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:33 Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses£º the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;
02Ex 39:34 the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of hides of sea cows and the shielding curtain;
02Ex 39:35 the ark of the Testimony with its poles and the atonement cover;
02Ex 39:36 the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence;
02Ex 39:37 the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and all its accessories, and the oil for the light;
02Ex 39:38 the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;
02Ex 39:39 the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;
02Ex 39:40 the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting;
02Ex 39:41 and the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests.
02Ex 39:42 The Israelites had done all the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:43 Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the LORD had commanded. So Moses blessed them.
02Ex 40:1 Then the LORD said to Moses£º
02Ex 40:2 "Set up the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the first month.
02Ex 40:3 Place the ark of the Testimony in it and shield the ark with the curtain.
02Ex 40:4 Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Then bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.
02Ex 40:5 Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:6 "Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting;
02Ex 40:7 place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it.
02Ex 40:8 Set up the courtyard around it and put the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard.
02Ex 40:9 "Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.
02Ex 40:10 Then anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it will be most holy.
02Ex 40:11 Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.
02Ex 40:12 "Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.
02Ex 40:13 Then dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest.
02Ex 40:14 Bring his sons and dress them in tunics.
02Ex 40:15 Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing will be to a priesthood that will continue for all generations to come."
02Ex 40:16 Moses did everything just as the LORD commanded him.
02Ex 40:17 So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.
02Ex 40:18 When Moses set up the tabernacle, he put the bases in place, erected the frames, inserted the crossbars and set up the posts.
02Ex 40:19 Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the LORD commanded him.
02Ex 40:20 He took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover over it.
02Ex 40:21 Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle and hung the shielding curtain and shielded the ark of the Testimony, as the LORD commanded him.
02Ex 40:22 Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle outside the curtain
02Ex 40:23 and set out the bread on it before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.
02Ex 40:24 He placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle
02Ex 40:25 and set up the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded him.
02Ex 40:26 Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain
02Ex 40:27 and burned fragrant incense on it, as the LORD commanded him.
02Ex 40:28 Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:29 He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it burnt offerings and grain offerings, as the LORD commanded him.
02Ex 40:30 He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing,
02Ex 40:31 and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.
02Ex 40:32 They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:33 Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work.
02Ex 40:34 Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:35 Moses could not enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.
02Ex 40:36 In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;
02Ex 40:37 but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out--until the day it lifted.
02Ex 40:38 So the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel during all their travels.

03Lv 1:1 The LORD called to Moses and spoke to him from the Tent of Meeting. He said,
03Lv 1:2 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'When any of you brings an offering to the LORD, bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock.

03Lv 1:17 He shall tear it open by the wings, not severing it completely, and then the priest shall burn it on the wood that is on the fire on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
03Lv 2:1 "'When someone brings a grain offering to the LORD, his offering is to be of fine flour. He is to pour oil on it, put incense on it

03Lv 5:12 He is to bring it to the priest, who shall take a handful of it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar on top of the offerings made to the LORD by fire. It is a sin offering.
03Lv 5:13 In this way the priest will make atonement for him for any of these sins he has committed, and he will be forgiven. The rest of the offering will belong to the priest, as in the case of the grain offering.'"
03Lv 5:14 The LORD said to Moses£º
03Lv 5:15 "When a person commits a violation and sins unintentionally in regard to any of the LORD'S holy things, he is to bring to the LORD as a penalty a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper value in silver, according to the sanctuary shekel. It is a guilt offering.
03Lv 5:16 He must make restitution for what he has failed to do in regard to the holy things, add a fifth of the value to that and give it all to the priest, who will make atonement for him with the ram as a guilt offering, and he will be forgiven.
03Lv 5:17 "If a person sins and does what is forbidden in any of the LORD'S commands, even though he does not know it, he is guilty and will be held responsible.
03Lv 5:18 He is to bring to the priest as a guilt offering a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper value. In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the wrong he has committed unintentionally, and he will be forgiven.
03Lv 5:19 It is a guilt offering; he has been guilty of wrongdoing against the LORD."
03Lv 6:1 The LORD said to Moses£º
03Lv 6:2 "If anyone sins and is unfaithful to the LORD by deceiving his neighbor about something entrusted to him or left in his care or stolen, or if he cheats him,
03Lv 6:3 or if he finds lost property and lies about it, or if he swears falsely, or if he commits any such sin that people may do--
03Lv 6:4 when he thus sins and becomes guilty, he must return what he has stolen or taken by extortion, or what was entrusted to him, or the lost property he found,
03Lv 6:5 or whatever it was he swore falsely about. He must make restitution in full, add a fifth of the value to it and give it all to the owner on the day he presents his guilt offering.
03Lv 6:6 And as a penalty he must bring to the priest, that is, to the LORD, his guilt offering, a ram from the flock, one without defect and of the proper value.
03Lv 6:7 In this way the priest will make atonement for him before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for any of these things he did that made him guilty."
03Lv 6:8 The LORD said to Moses£º
03Lv 6:9 "Give Aaron and his sons this command£º 'These are the regulations for the burnt offering£º The burnt offering is to remain on the altar hearth throughout the night, till morning, and the fire must be kept burning on the altar.
03Lv 6:10 The priest shall then put on his linen clothes, with linen undergarments next to his body, and shall remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar.
03Lv 6:11 Then he is to take off these clothes and put on others, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a place that is ceremonially clean.
03Lv 6:12 The fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest is to add firewood and arrange the burnt offering on the fire and burn the fat of the fellowship offerings on it.
03Lv 6:13 The fire must be kept burning on the altar continuously; it must not go out.
03Lv 6:14 "'These are the regulations for the grain offering£º Aaron's sons are to bring it before the LORD, in front of the altar.

03Lv 6:16 Aaron and his sons shall eat the rest of it, but it is to be eaten without yeast in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.
03Lv 6:17 It must not be baked with yeast; I have given it as their share of the offerings made to me by fire. Like the sin offering and the guilt offering, it is most holy.
03Lv 6:18 Any male descendant of Aaron may eat it. It is his regular share of the offerings made to the LORD by fire for the generations to come. Whatever touches them will become holy.'"
03Lv 6:19 The LORD also said to Moses,
03Lv 6:20 "This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to bring to the LORD on the day he is anointed£º a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half in the evening.

03Lv 6:22 The son who is to succeed him as anointed priest shall prepare it. It is the LORD'S regular share and is to be burned completely.
03Lv 6:23 Every grain offering of a priest shall be burned completely; it must not be eaten."
03Lv 6:24 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 6:25 "Say to Aaron and his sons£º 'These are the regulations for the sin offering£º The sin offering is to be slaughtered before the LORD in the place the burnt offering is slaughtered; it is most holy.
03Lv 6:26 The priest who offers it shall eat it; it is to be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting.
03Lv 6:27 Whatever touches any of the flesh will become holy, and if any of the blood is spattered on a garment, you must wash it in a holy place.
03Lv 6:28 The clay pot the meat is cooked in must be broken; but if it is cooked in a bronze pot, the pot is to be scoured and rinsed with water.
03Lv 6:29 Any male in a priest's family may eat it; it is most holy.
03Lv 6:30 But any sin offering whose blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place must not be eaten; it must be burned.
03Lv 7:1 "'These are the regulations for the guilt offering, which is most holy£º
03Lv 7:2 The guilt offering is to be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and its blood is to be sprinkled against the altar on all sides.

03Lv 7:4 both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the covering of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.
03Lv 7:5 The priest shall burn them on the altar as an offering made to the LORD by fire. It is a guilt offering.
03Lv 7:6 Any male in a priest's family may eat it, but it must be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.
03Lv 7:7 "'The same law applies to both the sin offering and the guilt offering£º They belong to the priest who makes atonement with them.
03Lv 7:8 The priest who offers a burnt offering for anyone may keep its hide for himself.
03Lv 7:9 Every grain offering baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who offers it,
03Lv 7:10 and every grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron.
03Lv 7:11 "'These are the regulations for the fellowship offering a person may present to the LORD£º
03Lv 7:12 "'If he offers it as an expression of thankfulness, then along with this thank offering he is to offer cakes of bread made without yeast and mixed with oil, wafers made without yeast and spread with oil, and cakes of fine flour well-kneaded and mixed with oil.
03Lv 7:13 Along with his fellowship offering of thanksgiving he is to present an offering with cakes of bread made with yeast.
03Lv 7:14 He is to bring one of each kind as an offering, a contribution to the LORD; it belongs to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the fellowship offerings.
03Lv 7:15 The meat of his fellowship offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day it is offered; he must leave none of it till morning.
03Lv 7:16 "'If, however, his offering is the result of a vow or is a freewill offering, the sacrifice shall be eaten on the day he offers it, but anything left over may be eaten on the next day.
03Lv 7:17 Any meat of the sacrifice left over till the third day must be burned up.
03Lv 7:18 If any meat of the fellowship offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted. It will not be credited to the one who offered it, for it is impure; the person who eats any of it will be held responsible.
03Lv 7:19 "'Meat that touches anything ceremonially unclean must not be eaten; it must be burned up. As for other meat, anyone ceremonially clean may eat it.
03Lv 7:20 But if anyone who is unclean eats any meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.
03Lv 7:21 If anyone touches something unclean--whether human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean, detestable thing--and then eats any of the meat of the fellowship offering belonging to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.'"
03Lv 7:22 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 7:23 "Say to the Israelites£º 'Do not eat any of the fat of cattle, sheep or goats.
03Lv 7:24 The fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it.

03Lv 7:26 And wherever you live, you must not eat the blood of any bird or animal.
03Lv 7:27 If anyone eats blood, that person must be cut off from his people.'"
03Lv 7:28 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 7:29 "Say to the Israelites£º 'Anyone who brings a fellowship offering to the LORD is to bring part of it as his sacrifice to the LORD.
03Lv 7:30 With his own hands he is to bring the offering made to the LORD by fire; he is to bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast before the LORD as a wave offering.
03Lv 7:31 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.
03Lv 7:32 You are to give the right thigh of your fellowship offerings to the priest as a contribution.
03Lv 7:33 The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the fellowship offering shall have the right thigh as his share.
03Lv 7:34 From the fellowship offerings of the Israelites, I have taken the breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their regular share from the Israelites.'"
03Lv 7:35 This is the portion of the offerings made to the LORD by fire that were allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests.
03Lv 7:36 On the day they were anointed, the LORD commanded that the Israelites give this to them as their regular share for the generations to come.
03Lv 7:37 These, then, are the regulations for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering and the fellowship offering,
03Lv 7:38 which the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the day he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the LORD, in the Desert of Sinai.
03Lv 8:1 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 8:2 "Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast,
03Lv 8:3 and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting."
03Lv 8:4 Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
03Lv 8:5 Moses said to the assembly, "This is what the LORD has commanded to be done."
03Lv 8:6 Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.
03Lv 8:7 He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also tied the ephod to him by its skillfully woven waistband; so it was fastened on him.
03Lv 8:8 He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece.
03Lv 8:9 Then he placed the turban on Aaron's head and set the gold plate, the sacred diadem, on the front of it, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:10 Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them.
03Lv 8:11 He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them.
03Lv 8:12 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head and anointed him to consecrate him.
03Lv 8:13 Then he brought Aaron's sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and put headbands on them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:14 He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
03Lv 8:15 Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it.
03Lv 8:16 Moses also took all the fat around the inner parts, the covering of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar.
03Lv 8:17 But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its offal he burned up outside the camp, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:18 He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
03Lv 8:19 Then Moses slaughtered the ram and sprinkled the blood against the altar on all sides.
03Lv 8:20 He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat.
03Lv 8:21 He washed the inner parts and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar as a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:22 He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.
03Lv 8:23 Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron's right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
03Lv 8:24 Moses also brought Aaron's sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he sprinkled blood against the altar on all sides.
03Lv 8:25 He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the inner parts, the covering of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.
03Lv 8:26 Then from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the LORD, he took a cake of bread, and one made with oil, and a wafer; he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh.
03Lv 8:27 He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and waved them before the LORD as a wave offering.
03Lv 8:28 Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire.
03Lv 8:29 He also took the breast--Moses' share of the ordination ram--and waved it before the LORD as a wave offering, as the LORD commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:30 Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments.
03Lv 8:31 Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, "Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons are to eat it.'
03Lv 8:32 Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread.
03Lv 8:33 Do not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days.
03Lv 8:34 What has been done today was commanded by the LORD to make atonement for you.
03Lv 8:35 You must stay at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting day and night for seven days and do what the LORD requires, so you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded."
03Lv 8:36 So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD commanded through Moses.
03Lv 9:1 On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
03Lv 9:2 He said to Aaron, "Take a bull calf for your sin offering and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the LORD.
03Lv 9:3 Then say to the Israelites£º 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb--both a year old and without defect--for a burnt offering,
03Lv 9:4 and an ox and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the LORD, together with a grain offering mixed with oil. For today the LORD will appear to you.'"
03Lv 9:5 They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the LORD.
03Lv 9:6 Then Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
03Lv 9:7 Moses said to Aaron, "Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded."
03Lv 9:8 So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
03Lv 9:9 His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.
03Lv 9:10 On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the covering of the liver from the sin offering, as the LORD commanded Moses;
03Lv 9:11 the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp.
03Lv 9:12 Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.
03Lv 9:13 They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.
03Lv 9:14 He washed the inner parts and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.
03Lv 9:15 Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people's sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one.
03Lv 9:16 He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way.
03Lv 9:17 He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning's burnt offering.
03Lv 9:18 He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it against the altar on all sides.
03Lv 9:19 But the fat portions of the ox and the ram--the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the covering of the liver--
03Lv 9:20 these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar.
03Lv 9:21 Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the LORD as a wave offering, as Moses commanded.
03Lv 9:22 Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down.
03Lv 9:23 Moses and Aaron then went into the Tent of Meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.
03Lv 9:24 Fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown.
03Lv 10:1 Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD, contrary to his command.
03Lv 10:2 So fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them, and they died before the LORD.
03Lv 10:3 Moses then said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD spoke of when he said£º "'Among those who approach me I will show myself holy; in the sight of all the people I will be honored.'" Aaron remained silent.
03Lv 10:4 Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel, and said to them, "Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary."
03Lv 10:5 So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered.
03Lv 10:6 Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not let your hair become unkempt, and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the LORD will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the house of Israel, may mourn for those the LORD has destroyed by fire.
03Lv 10:7 Do not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting or you will die, because the LORD'S anointing oil is on you." So they did as Moses said.
03Lv 10:8 Then the LORD said to Aaron,
03Lv 10:9 "You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the Tent of Meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
03Lv 10:10 You must distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean and the clean,
03Lv 10:11 and you must teach the Israelites all the decrees the LORD has given them through Moses."
03Lv 10:12 Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take the grain offering left over from the offerings made to the LORD by fire and eat it prepared without yeast beside the altar, for it is most holy.
03Lv 10:13 Eat it in a holy place, because it is your share and your sons' share of the offerings made to the LORD by fire; for so I have been commanded.
03Lv 10:14 But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites' fellowship offerings.
03Lv 10:15 The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the offerings made by fire, to be waved before the LORD as a wave offering. This will be the regular share for you and your children, as the LORD has commanded."
03Lv 10:16 When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering and found that it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, and asked,
03Lv 10:17 "Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the LORD.
03Lv 10:18 Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded."
03Lv 10:19 Aaron replied to Moses, "Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, but such things as this have happened to me. Would the LORD have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?"
03Lv 10:20 When Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
03Lv 11:1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
03Lv 11:2 "Say to the Israelites£º 'Of all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat£º
03Lv 11:3 You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.
03Lv 11:4 "'There are some that only chew the cud or only have a split hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is ceremonially unclean for you.

03Lv 11:6 The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you.
03Lv 11:7 And the pig, though it has a split hoof completely divided, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you.

03Lv 11:11 And since you are to detest them, you must not eat their meat and you must detest their carcasses.
03Lv 11:12 Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be detestable to you.

03Lv 23:35 The first day is a sacred assembly; do no regular work.
03Lv 23:36 For seven days present offerings made to the LORD by fire, and on the eighth day hold a sacred assembly and present an offering made to the LORD by fire. It is the closing assembly; do no regular work.
03Lv 23:37 ("'These are the LORD'S appointed feasts, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies for bringing offerings made to the LORD by fire--the burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings required for each day.
03Lv 23:38 These offerings are in addition to those for the LORD'S Sabbaths and in addition to your gifts and whatever you have vowed and all the freewill offerings you give to the LORD.)
03Lv 23:39 "'So beginning with the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you have gathered the crops of the land, celebrate the festival to the LORD for seven days; the first day is a day of rest, and the eighth day also is a day of rest.
03Lv 23:40 On the first day you are to take choice fruit from the trees, and palm fronds, leafy branches and poplars, and rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.
03Lv 23:41 Celebrate this as a festival to the LORD for seven days each year. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come; celebrate it in the seventh month.
03Lv 23:42 Live in booths for seven days£º All native-born Israelites are to live in booths
03Lv 23:43 so your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.'"
03Lv 23:44 So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed feasts of the LORD.
03Lv 24:1 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 24:2 "Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning continually.
03Lv 24:3 Outside the curtain of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening till morning, continually. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.
03Lv 24:4 The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD must be tended continually.
03Lv 24:5 "Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf.
03Lv 24:6 Set them in two rows, six in each row, on the table of pure gold before the LORD.
03Lv 24:7 Along each row put some pure incense as a memorial portion to represent the bread and to be an offering made to the LORD by fire.
03Lv 24:8 This bread is to be set out before the LORD regularly, Sabbath after Sabbath, on behalf of the Israelites, as a lasting covenant.
03Lv 24:9 It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place, because it is a most holy part of their regular share of the offerings made to the LORD by fire."
03Lv 24:10 Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.
03Lv 24:11 The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri the Danite.)
03Lv 24:12 They put him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.
03Lv 24:13 Then the LORD said to Moses£º
03Lv 24:14 "Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.
03Lv 24:15 Say to the Israelites£º 'If anyone curses his God, he will be held responsible;
03Lv 24:16 anyone who blasphemes the name of the LORD must be put to death. The entire assembly must stone him. Whether an alien or native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.
03Lv 24:17 "'If anyone takes the life of a human being, he must be put to death.
03Lv 24:18 Anyone who takes the life of someone's animal must make restitution--life for life.
03Lv 24:19 If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him£º
03Lv 24:20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As he has injured the other, so he is to be injured.
03Lv 24:21 Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death.
03Lv 24:22 You are to have the same law for the alien and the native-born. I am the LORD your God.'"
03Lv 24:23 Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the LORD commanded Moses.
03Lv 25:1 The LORD said to Moses on Mount Sinai,
03Lv 25:2 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the LORD.
03Lv 25:3 For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops.
03Lv 25:4 But in the seventh year the land is to have a sabbath of rest, a sabbath to the LORD. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards.
03Lv 25:5 Do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest.
03Lv 25:6 Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you--for yourself, your manservant and maidservant, and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you,
03Lv 25:7 as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.
03Lv 25:8 "'Count off seven sabbaths of years--seven times seven years--so that the seven sabbaths of years amount to a period of forty-nine years.
03Lv 25:9 Then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land.
03Lv 25:10 Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each one of you is to return to his family property and each to his own clan.
03Lv 25:11 The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines.
03Lv 25:12 For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.
03Lv 25:13 "'In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to his own property.
03Lv 25:14 "'If you sell land to one of your countrymen or buy any from him, do not take advantage of each other.
03Lv 25:15 You are to buy from your countryman on the basis of the number of years since the Jubilee. And he is to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops.
03Lv 25:16 When the years are many, you are to increase the price, and when the years are few, you are to decrease the price, because what he is really selling you is the number of crops.
03Lv 25:17 Do not take advantage of each other, but fear your God. I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 25:18 "'Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land.
03Lv 25:19 Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety.
03Lv 25:20 You may ask, "What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?"
03Lv 25:21 I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years.
03Lv 25:22 While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.
03Lv 25:23 "'The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants.
03Lv 25:24 Throughout the country that you hold as a possession, you must provide for the redemption of the land.
03Lv 25:25 "'If one of your countrymen becomes poor and sells some of his property, his nearest relative is to come and redeem what his countryman has sold.
03Lv 25:26 If, however, a man has no one to redeem it for him but he himself prospers and acquires sufficient means to redeem it,
03Lv 25:27 he is to determine the value for the years since he sold it and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it; he can then go back to his own property.
03Lv 25:28 But if he does not acquire the means to repay him, what he sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and he can then go back to his property.
03Lv 25:29 "'If a man sells a house in a walled city, he retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale. During that time he may redeem it.
03Lv 25:30 If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and his descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee.
03Lv 25:31 But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.
03Lv 25:32 "'The Levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess.
03Lv 25:33 So the property of the Levites is redeemable--that is, a house sold in any town they hold--and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their property among the Israelites.
03Lv 25:34 But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.
03Lv 25:35 "'If one of your countrymen becomes poor and is unable to support himself among you, help him as you would an alien or a temporary resident, so he can continue to live among you.
03Lv 25:36 Do not take interest of any kind from him, but fear your God, so that your countryman may continue to live among you.
03Lv 25:37 You must not lend him money at interest or sell him food at a profit.
03Lv 25:38 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
03Lv 25:39 "'If one of your countrymen becomes poor among you and sells himself to you, do not make him work as a slave.
03Lv 25:40 He is to be treated as a hired worker or a temporary resident among you; he is to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.
03Lv 25:41 Then he and his children are to be released, and he will go back to his own clan and to the property of his forefathers.
03Lv 25:42 Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.

03Lv 25:49 An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in his clan may redeem him. Or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.
03Lv 25:50 He and his buyer are to count the time from the year he sold himself up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for his release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired man for that number of years.
03Lv 25:51 If many years remain, he must pay for his redemption a larger share of the price paid for him.
03Lv 25:52 If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he is to compute that and pay for his redemption accordingly.
03Lv 25:53 He is to be treated as a man hired from year to year; you must see to it that his owner does not rule over him ruthlessly.
03Lv 25:54 "'Even if he is not redeemed in any of these ways, he and his children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee,

03Lv 26:46 These are the decrees, the laws and the regulations that the LORD established on Mount Sinai between himself and the Israelites through Moses.
03Lv 27:1 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 27:2 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate persons to the LORD by giving equivalent values,
03Lv 27:3 set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel;

03Lv 27:5 If it is a person between the ages of five and twenty, set the value of a male at twenty shekels and of a female at ten shekels.
03Lv 27:6 If it is a person between one month and five years, set the value of a male at five shekels of silver and that of a female at three shekels of silver.
03Lv 27:7 If it is a person sixty years old or more, set the value of a male at fifteen shekels and of a female at ten shekels.
03Lv 27:8 If anyone making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount, he is to present the person to the priest, who will set the value for him according to what the man making the vow can afford.
03Lv 27:9 "'If what he vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the LORD, such an animal given to the LORD becomes holy.
03Lv 27:10 He must not exchange it or substitute a good one for a bad one, or a bad one for a good one; if he should substitute one animal for another, both it and the substitute become holy.
03Lv 27:11 If what he vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal--one that is not acceptable as an offering to the LORD--the animal must be presented to the priest,
03Lv 27:12 who will judge its quality as good or bad. Whatever value the priest then sets, that is what it will be.

03Lv 27:17 If he dedicates his field during the Year of Jubilee, the value that has been set remains.
03Lv 27:18 But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next Year of Jubilee, and its set value will be reduced.
03Lv 27:19 If the man who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, he must add a fifth to its value, and the field will again become his.
03Lv 27:20 If, however, he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold it to someone else, it can never be redeemed.
03Lv 27:21 When the field is released in the Jubilee, it will become holy, like a field devoted to the LORD; it will become the property of the priests.
03Lv 27:22 "'If a man dedicates to the LORD a field he has bought, which is not part of his family land,
03Lv 27:23 the priest will determine its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the man must pay its value on that day as something holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:24 In the Year of Jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom he bought it, the one whose land it was.
03Lv 27:25 Every value is to be set according to the sanctuary shekel, twenty gerahs to the shekel.
03Lv 27:26 "'No one, however, may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn already belongs to the LORD; whether an ox or a sheep, it is the LORD'S.
03Lv 27:27 If it is one of the unclean animals, he may buy it back at its set value, adding a fifth of the value to it. If he does not redeem it, it is to be sold at its set value.
03Lv 27:28 "'But nothing that a man owns and devotes to the LORD--whether man or animal or family land--may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the LORD.

03Lv 27:30 "'A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:31 If a man redeems any of his tithe, he must add a fifth of the value to it.
03Lv 27:32 The entire tithe of the herd and flock--every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd's rod--will be holy to the LORD.
03Lv 27:33 He must not pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution. If he does make a substitution, both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed.'"
03Lv 27:34 These are the commands the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.

04Nm 1:45 All the Israelites twenty years old or more who were able to serve in Israel's army were counted according to their families.
04Nm 1:46 The total number was 603,550.
04Nm 1:47 The families of the tribe of Levi, however, were not counted along with the others.
04Nm 1:48 The LORD had said to Moses£º
04Nm 1:49 "You must not count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites.
04Nm 1:50 Instead, appoint the Levites to be in charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony--over all its furnishings and everything belonging to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they are to take care of it and encamp around it.
04Nm 1:51 Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Anyone else who goes near it shall be put to death.
04Nm 1:52 The Israelites are to set up their tents by divisions, each man in his own camp under his own standard.
04Nm 1:53 The Levites, however, are to set up their tents around the tabernacle of the Testimony so that wrath will not fall on the Israelite community. The Levites are to be responsible for the care of the tabernacle of the Testimony."
04Nm 1:54 The Israelites did all this just as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 2:1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron£º
04Nm 2:2 "The Israelites are to camp around the Tent of Meeting some distance from it, each man under his standard with the banners of his family."
04Nm 2:3 On the east, toward the sunrise, the divisions of the camp of Judah are to encamp under their standard. The leader of the people of Judah is Nahshon son of Amminadab.
04Nm 2:4 His division numbers 74,600.
04Nm 2:5 The tribe of Issachar will camp next to them. The leader of the people of Issachar is Nethanel son of Zuar.
04Nm 2:6 His division numbers 54,400.
04Nm 2:7 The tribe of Zebulun will be next. The leader of the people of Zebulun is Eliab son of Helon.
04Nm 2:8 His division numbers 57,400.
04Nm 2:9 All the men assigned to the camp of Judah, according to their divisions, number 186,400. They will set out first.
04Nm 2:10 On the south will be the divisions of the camp of Reuben under their standard. The leader of the people of Reuben is Elizur son of Shedeur.
04Nm 2:11 His division numbers 46,500.
04Nm 2:12 The tribe of Simeon will camp next to them. The leader of the people of Simeon is Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.
04Nm 2:13 His division numbers 59,300.
04Nm 2:14 The tribe of Gad will be next. The leader of the people of Gad is Eliasaph son of Deuel.
04Nm 2:15 His division numbers 45,650.
04Nm 2:16 All the men assigned to the camp of Reuben, according to their divisions, number 151,450. They will set out second.
04Nm 2:17 Then the Tent of Meeting and the camp of the Levites will set out in the middle of the camps. They will set out in the same order as they encamp, each in his own place under his standard.
04Nm 2:18 On the west will be the divisions of the camp of Ephraim under their standard. The leader of the people of Ephraim is Elishama son of Ammihud.
04Nm 2:19 His division numbers 40,500.
04Nm 2:20 The tribe of Manasseh will be next to them. The leader of the people of Manasseh is Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.
04Nm 2:21 His division numbers 32,200.
04Nm 2:22 The tribe of Benjamin will be next. The leader of the people of Benjamin is Abidan son of Gideoni.
04Nm 2:23 His division numbers 35,400.
04Nm 2:24 All the men assigned to the camp of Ephraim, according to their divisions, number 108,100. They will set out third.
04Nm 2:25 On the north will be the divisions of the camp of Dan, under their standard. The leader of the people of Dan is Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
04Nm 2:26 His division numbers 62,700.

04Nm 2:30 His division numbers 53,400.
04Nm 2:31 All the men assigned to the camp of Dan number 157,600. They will set out last, under their standards.
04Nm 2:32 These are the Israelites, counted according to their families. All those in the camps, by their divisions, number 603,550.
04Nm 2:33 The Levites, however, were not counted along with the other Israelites, as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 2:34 So the Israelites did everything the LORD commanded Moses; that is the way they encamped under their standards, and that is the way they set out, each with his clan and family.
04Nm 3:1 This is the account of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time the LORD talked with Moses on Mount Sinai.
04Nm 3:2 The names of the sons of Aaron were Nadab the firstborn and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
04Nm 3:3 Those were the names of Aaron's sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.
04Nm 3:4 Nadab and Abihu, however, fell dead before the LORD when they made an offering with unauthorized fire before him in the Desert of Sinai. They had no sons; so only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.
04Nm 3:5 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 3:6 "Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron the priest to assist him.
04Nm 3:7 They are to perform duties for him and for the whole community at the Tent of Meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:8 They are to take care of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by doing the work of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:9 Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to him.
04Nm 3:10 Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; anyone else who approaches the sanctuary must be put to death."
04Nm 3:11 The LORD also said to Moses,
04Nm 3:12 "I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of the first male offspring of every Israelite woman. The Levites are mine,
04Nm 3:13 for all the firstborn are mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart for myself every firstborn in Israel, whether man or animal. They are to be mine. I am the LORD."
04Nm 3:14 The LORD said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai,
04Nm 3:15 "Count the Levites by their families and clans. Count every male a month old or more."
04Nm 3:16 So Moses counted them, as he was commanded by the word of the LORD.
04Nm 3:17 These were the names of the sons of Levi£º Gershon, Kohath and Merari.
04Nm 3:18 These were the names of the Gershonite clans£º Libni and Shimei.
04Nm 3:19 The Kohathite clans£º Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel.
04Nm 3:20 The Merarite clans£º Mahli and Mushi. These were the Levite clans, according to their families.
04Nm 3:21 To Gershon belonged the clans of the Libnites and Shimeites; these were the Gershonite clans.
04Nm 3:22 The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 7,500.
04Nm 3:23 The Gershonite clans were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:24 The leader of the families of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.
04Nm 3:25 At the Tent of Meeting the Gershonites were responsible for the care of the tabernacle and tent, its coverings, the curtain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
04Nm 3:26 the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, and the ropes--and everything related to their use.
04Nm 3:27 To Kohath belonged the clans of the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites and Uzzielites; these were the Kohathite clans.
04Nm 3:28 The number of all the males a month old or more was 8,600. The Kohathites were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
04Nm 3:29 The Kohathite clans were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:30 The leader of the families of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
04Nm 3:31 They were responsible for the care of the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the articles of the sanctuary used in ministering, the curtain, and everything related to their use.
04Nm 3:32 The chief leader of the Levites was Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest. He was appointed over those who were responsible for the care of the sanctuary.
04Nm 3:33 To Merari belonged the clans of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the Merarite clans.
04Nm 3:34 The number of all the males a month old or more who were counted was 6,200.
04Nm 3:35 The leader of the families of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail; they were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.
04Nm 3:36 The Merarites were appointed to take care of the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, bases, all its equipment, and everything related to their use,
04Nm 3:37 as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs and ropes.
04Nm 3:38 Moses and Aaron and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle, toward the sunrise, in front of the Tent of Meeting. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Anyone else who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death.
04Nm 3:39 The total number of Levites counted at the LORD'S command by Moses and Aaron according to their clans, including every male a month old or more, was 22,000.
04Nm 3:40 The LORD said to Moses, "Count all the firstborn Israelite males who are a month old or more and make a list of their names.
04Nm 3:41 Take the Levites for me in place of all the firstborn of the Israelites, and the livestock of the Levites in place of all the firstborn of the livestock of the Israelites. I am the LORD."
04Nm 3:42 So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites, as the LORD commanded him.
04Nm 3:43 The total number of firstborn males a month old or more, listed by name, was 22,273.
04Nm 3:44 The LORD also said to Moses,
04Nm 3:45 "Take the Levites in place of all the firstborn of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites are to be mine. I am the LORD.
04Nm 3:46 To redeem the 273 firstborn Israelites who exceed the number of the Levites,
04Nm 3:47 collect five shekels for each one, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.
04Nm 3:48 Give the money for the redemption of the additional Israelites to Aaron and his sons."
04Nm 3:49 So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number redeemed by the Levites.
04Nm 3:50 From the firstborn of the Israelites he collected silver weighing 1,365 shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel.
04Nm 3:51 Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and his sons, as he was commanded by the word of the LORD.
04Nm 4:1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron£º
04Nm 4:2 "Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their clans and families.
04Nm 4:3 Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work in the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 4:4 "This is the work of the Kohathites in the Tent of Meeting£º the care of the most holy things.
04Nm 4:5 When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down the shielding curtain and cover the ark of the Testimony with it.
04Nm 4:6 Then they are to cover this with hides of sea cows, spread a cloth of solid blue over that and put the poles in place.
04Nm 4:7 "Over the table of the Presence they are to spread a blue cloth and put on it the plates, dishes and bowls, and the jars for drink offerings; the bread that is continually there is to remain on it.
04Nm 4:8 Over these they are to spread a scarlet cloth, cover that with hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.
04Nm 4:9 "They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand that is for light, together with its lamps, its wick trimmers and trays, and all its jars for the oil used to supply it.
04Nm 4:10 Then they are to wrap it and all its accessories in a covering of hides of sea cows and put it on a carrying frame.
04Nm 4:11 "Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover that with hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.
04Nm 4:12 "They are to take all the articles used for ministering in the sanctuary, wrap them in a blue cloth, cover that with hides of sea cows and put them on a carrying frame.
04Nm 4:13 "They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.
04Nm 4:14 Then they are to place on it all the utensils used for ministering at the altar, including the firepans, meat forks, shovels and sprinkling bowls. Over it they are to spread a covering of hides of sea cows and put its poles in place.
04Nm 4:15 "After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy furnishings and all the holy articles, and when the camp is ready to move, the Kohathites are to come to do the carrying. But they must not touch the holy things or they will die. The Kohathites are to carry those things that are in the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 4:16 "Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, is to have charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering and the anointing oil. He is to be in charge of the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its holy furnishings and articles."
04Nm 4:17 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 4:18 "See that the Kohathite tribal clans are not cut off from the Levites.
04Nm 4:19 So that they may live and not die when they come near the most holy things, do this for them£º Aaron and his sons are to go into the sanctuary and assign to each man his work and what he is to carry.
04Nm 4:20 But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die."
04Nm 4:21 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 4:22 "Take a census also of the Gershonites by their families and clans.
04Nm 4:23 Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 4:24 "This is the service of the Gershonite clans as they work and carry burdens£º
04Nm 4:25 They are to carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, its covering and the outer covering of hides of sea cows, the curtains for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting,
04Nm 4:26 the curtains of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, the curtain for the entrance, the ropes and all the equipment used in its service. The Gershonites are to do all that needs to be done with these things.
04Nm 4:27 All their service, whether carrying or doing other work, is to be done under the direction of Aaron and his sons. You shall assign to them as their responsibility all they are to carry.
04Nm 4:28 This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the Tent of Meeting. Their duties are to be under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
04Nm 4:29 "Count the Merarites by their clans and families.
04Nm 4:30 Count all the men from thirty to fifty years of age who come to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 4:31 This is their duty as they perform service at the Tent of Meeting£º to carry the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts and bases,
04Nm 4:32 as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, ropes, all their equipment and everything related to their use. Assign to each man the specific things he is to carry.
04Nm 4:33 This is the service of the Merarite clans as they work at the Tent of Meeting under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest."
04Nm 4:34 Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the community counted the Kohathites by their clans and families.
04Nm 4:35 All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work in the Tent of Meeting,
04Nm 4:36 counted by clans, were 2,750.
04Nm 4:37 This was the total of all those in the Kohathite clans who served in the Tent of Meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the LORD'S command through Moses.
04Nm 4:38 The Gershonites were counted by their clans and families.
04Nm 4:39 All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting,
04Nm 4:40 counted by their clans and families, were 2,630.
04Nm 4:41 This was the total of those in the Gershonite clans who served at the Tent of Meeting. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the LORD'S command.
04Nm 4:42 The Merarites were counted by their clans and families.
04Nm 4:43 All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to serve in the work at the Tent of Meeting,
04Nm 4:44 counted by their clans, were 3,200.
04Nm 4:45 This was the total of those in the Merarite clans. Moses and Aaron counted them according to the LORD'S command through Moses.
04Nm 4:46 So Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted all the Levites by their clans and families.
04Nm 4:47 All the men from thirty to fifty years of age who came to do the work of serving and carrying the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 4:48 numbered 8,580.
04Nm 4:49 At the LORD'S command through Moses, each was assigned his work and told what to carry. Thus they were counted, as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 5:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 5:2 "Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has an infectious skin disease or a discharge of any kind, or who is ceremonially unclean because of a dead body.
04Nm 5:3 Send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them."
04Nm 5:4 The Israelites did this; they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the LORD had instructed Moses.
04Nm 5:5 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 5:6 "Say to the Israelites£º 'When a man or woman wrongs another in any way and so is unfaithful to the LORD, that person is guilty
04Nm 5:7 and must confess the sin he has committed. He must make full restitution for his wrong, add one fifth to it and give it all to the person he has wronged.
04Nm 5:8 But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the LORD and must be given to the priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for him.
04Nm 5:9 All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him.
04Nm 5:10 Each man's sacred gifts are his own, but what he gives to the priest will belong to the priest.'"
04Nm 5:11 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 5:12 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'If a man's wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him
04Nm 5:13 by sleeping with another man, and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act),
04Nm 5:14 and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure--or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure--
04Nm 5:15 then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder offering to draw attention to guilt.
04Nm 5:16 "'The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the LORD.
04Nm 5:17 Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.
04Nm 5:18 After the priest has had the woman stand before the LORD, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse.
04Nm 5:19 Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, "If no other man has slept with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you.
04Nm 5:20 But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have defiled yourself by sleeping with a man other than your husband"--
04Nm 5:21 here the priest is to put the woman under this curse of the oath--"may the LORD cause your people to curse and denounce you when he causes your thigh to waste away and your abdomen to swell.
04Nm 5:22 May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells and your thigh wastes away." "'Then the woman is to say, "Amen. So be it."
04Nm 5:23 "'The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water.
04Nm 5:24 He shall have the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water will enter her and cause bitter suffering.
04Nm 5:25 The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the LORD and bring it to the altar.
04Nm 5:26 The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water.
04Nm 5:27 If she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband, then when she is made to drink the water that brings a curse, it will go into her and cause bitter suffering; her abdomen will swell and her thigh waste away, and she will become accursed among her people.
04Nm 5:28 If, however, the woman has not defiled herself and is free from impurity, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.
04Nm 5:29 "'This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and defiles herself while married to her husband,
04Nm 5:30 or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the LORD and is to apply this entire law to her.
04Nm 5:31 The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin.'"
04Nm 6:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 6:2 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'If a man or woman wants to make a special vow, a vow of separation to the LORD as a Nazirite,
04Nm 6:3 he must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or from other fermented drink. He must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins.
04Nm 6:4 As long as he is a Nazirite, he must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins.
04Nm 6:5 "'During the entire period of his vow of separation no razor may be used on his head. He must be holy until the period of his separation to the LORD is over; he must let the hair of his head grow long.
04Nm 6:6 Throughout the period of his separation to the LORD he must not go near a dead body.
04Nm 6:7 Even if his own father or mother or brother or sister dies, he must not make himself ceremonially unclean on account of them, because the symbol of his separation to God is on his head.
04Nm 6:8 Throughout the period of his separation he is consecrated to the LORD.
04Nm 6:9 "'If someone dies suddenly in his presence, thus defiling the hair he has dedicated, he must shave his head on the day of his cleansing--the seventh day.
04Nm 6:10 Then on the eighth day he must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 6:11 The priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for him because he sinned by being in the presence of the dead body. That same day he is to consecrate his head.
04Nm 6:12 He must dedicate himself to the LORD for the period of his separation and must bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days do not count, because he became defiled during his separation.
04Nm 6:13 "'Now this is the law for the Nazirite when the period of his separation is over. He is to be brought to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 6:14 There he is to present his offerings to the LORD£º a year-old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect for a sin offering, a ram without defect for a fellowship offering,
04Nm 6:15 together with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and a basket of bread made without yeast--cakes made of fine flour mixed with oil, and wafers spread with oil.
04Nm 6:16 "'The priest is to present them before the LORD and make the sin offering and the burnt offering.
04Nm 6:17 He is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to the LORD, together with its grain offering and drink offering.
04Nm 6:18 "'Then at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the Nazirite must shave off the hair that he dedicated. He is to take the hair and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering.
04Nm 6:19 "'After the Nazirite has shaved off the hair of his dedication, the priest is to place in his hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, and a cake and a wafer from the basket, both made without yeast.
04Nm 6:20 The priest shall then wave them before the LORD as a wave offering; they are holy and belong to the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. After that, the Nazirite may drink wine.
04Nm 6:21 "'This is the law of the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD in accordance with his separation, in addition to whatever else he can afford. He must fulfill the vow he has made, according to the law of the Nazirite.'"
04Nm 6:22 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 6:23 "Tell Aaron and his sons, 'This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them£º
04Nm 6:24 "' "The LORD bless you and keep you;
04Nm 6:25 the LORD make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you;
04Nm 6:26 the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace." '
04Nm 6:27 "So they will put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them."
04Nm 7:1 When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings. He also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils.
04Nm 7:2 Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted, made offerings.
04Nm 7:3 They brought as their gifts before the LORD six covered carts and twelve oxen--an ox from each leader and a cart from every two. These they presented before the tabernacle.
04Nm 7:4 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 7:5 "Accept these from them, that they may be used in the work at the Tent of Meeting. Give them to the Levites as each man's work requires."
04Nm 7:6 So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.
04Nm 7:7 He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their work required,
04Nm 7:8 and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their work required. They were all under the direction of Ithamar son of Aaron, the priest.
04Nm 7:9 But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, because they were to carry on their shoulders the holy things, for which they were responsible.
04Nm 7:10 When the altar was anointed, the leaders brought their offerings for its dedication and presented them before the altar.

04Nm 7:89 When Moses entered the Tent of Meeting to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from between the two cherubim above the atonement cover on the ark of the Testimony. And he spoke with him.
04Nm 8:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 8:2 "Speak to Aaron and say to him, 'When you set up the seven lamps, they are to light the area in front of the lampstand.'"
04Nm 8:3 Aaron did so; he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand, just as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 8:4 This is how the lampstand was made£º It was made of hammered gold--from its base to its blossoms. The lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the LORD had shown Moses.
04Nm 8:5 The LORD said to Moses£º
04Nm 8:6 "Take the Levites from among the other Israelites and make them ceremonially clean.
04Nm 8:7 To purify them, do this£º Sprinkle the water of cleansing on them; then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes, and so purify themselves.
04Nm 8:8 Have them take a young bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil; then you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.
04Nm 8:9 Bring the Levites to the front of the Tent of Meeting and assemble the whole Israelite community.
04Nm 8:10 You are to bring the Levites before the LORD, and the Israelites are to lay their hands on them.
04Nm 8:11 Aaron is to present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may be ready to do the work of the LORD.
04Nm 8:12 "After the Levites lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, use the one for a sin offering to the LORD and the other for a burnt offering, to make atonement for the Levites.
04Nm 8:13 Have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons and then present them as a wave offering to the LORD.
04Nm 8:14 In this way you are to set the Levites apart from the other Israelites, and the Levites will be mine.
04Nm 8:15 "After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering, they are to come to do their work at the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 8:16 They are the Israelites who are to be given wholly to me. I have taken them as my own in place of the firstborn, the first male offspring from every Israelite woman.
04Nm 8:17 Every firstborn male in Israel, whether man or animal, is mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself.
04Nm 8:18 And I have taken the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons in Israel.
04Nm 8:19 Of all the Israelites, I have given the Levites as gifts to Aaron and his sons to do the work at the Tent of Meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the Israelites when they go near the sanctuary."
04Nm 8:20 Moses, Aaron and the whole Israelite community did with the Levites just as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 8:21 The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD and made atonement for them to purify them.
04Nm 8:22 After that, the Levites came to do their work at the Tent of Meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 8:23 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 8:24 "This applies to the Levites£º Men twenty-five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the Tent of Meeting,
04Nm 8:25 but at the age of fifty, they must retire from their regular service and work no longer.
04Nm 8:26 They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the Tent of Meeting, but they themselves must not do the work. This, then, is how you are to assign the responsibilities of the Levites."
04Nm 9:1 The LORD spoke to Moses in the Desert of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of Egypt. He said,
04Nm 9:2 "Have the Israelites celebrate the Passover at the appointed time.
04Nm 9:3 Celebrate it at the appointed time, at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month, in accordance with all its rules and regulations."
04Nm 9:4 So Moses told the Israelites to celebrate the Passover,
04Nm 9:5 and they did so in the Desert of Sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month. The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 9:6 But some of them could not celebrate the Passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body. So they came to Moses and Aaron that same day
04Nm 9:7 and said to Moses, "We have become unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be kept from presenting the LORD'S offering with the other Israelites at the appointed time?"
04Nm 9:8 Moses answered them, "Wait until I find out what the LORD commands concerning you."
04Nm 9:9 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 9:10 "Tell the Israelites£º 'When any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away on a journey, they may still celebrate the LORD'S Passover.
04Nm 9:11 They are to celebrate it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight. They are to eat the lamb, together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
04Nm 9:12 They must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones. When they celebrate the Passover, they must follow all the regulations.
04Nm 9:13 But if a man who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the Passover, that person must be cut off from his people because he did not present the LORD'S offering at the appointed time. That man will bear the consequences of his sin.
04Nm 9:14 "'An alien living among you who wants to celebrate the LORD'S Passover must do so in accordance with its rules and regulations. You must have the same regulations for the alien and the native-born.'"
04Nm 9:15 On the day the tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony, was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire.
04Nm 9:16 That is how it continued to be; the cloud covered it, and at night it looked like fire.
04Nm 9:17 Whenever the cloud lifted from above the Tent, the Israelites set out; wherever the cloud settled, the Israelites encamped.
04Nm 9:18 At the LORD'S command the Israelites set out, and at his command they encamped. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.
04Nm 9:19 When the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time, the Israelites obeyed the LORD'S order and did not set out.
04Nm 9:20 Sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days; at the LORD'S command they would encamp, and then at his command they would set out.
04Nm 9:21 Sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning, and when it lifted in the morning, they set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they set out.
04Nm 9:22 Whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year, the Israelites would remain in camp and not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out.
04Nm 9:23 At the LORD'S command they encamped, and at the LORD'S command they set out. They obeyed the LORD'S order, in accordance with his command through Moses.
04Nm 10:1 The LORD said to Moses£º
04Nm 10:2 "Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out.
04Nm 10:3 When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 10:4 If only one is sounded, the leaders--the heads of the clans of Israel--are to assemble before you.
04Nm 10:5 When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out.
04Nm 10:6 At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out.
04Nm 10:7 To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the same signal.
04Nm 10:8 "The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come.
04Nm 10:9 When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the LORD your God and rescued from your enemies.
04Nm 10:10 Also at your times of rejoicing--your appointed feasts and New Moon festivals--you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the LORD your God."
04Nm 10:11 On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the Testimony.
04Nm 10:12 Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.
04Nm 10:13 They set out, this first time, at the LORD'S command through Moses.
04Nm 10:14 The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command.
04Nm 10:15 Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar,
04Nm 10:16 and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun.
04Nm 10:17 Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out.
04Nm 10:18 The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command.
04Nm 10:19 Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon,
04Nm 10:20 and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad.
04Nm 10:21 Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived.
04Nm 10:22 The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command.
04Nm 10:23 Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh,
04Nm 10:24 and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin.
04Nm 10:25 Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out, under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command.
04Nm 10:26 Pagiel son of Ocran was over the division of the tribe of Asher,
04Nm 10:27 and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali.
04Nm 10:28 This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.
04Nm 10:29 Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are setting out for the place about which the LORD said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised good things to Israel."
04Nm 10:30 He answered, "No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people."
04Nm 10:31 But Moses said, "Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the desert, and you can be our eyes.
04Nm 10:32 If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the LORD gives us."
04Nm 10:33 So they set out from the mountain of the LORD and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest.
04Nm 10:34 The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
04Nm 10:35 Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, "Rise up, O LORD! May your enemies be scattered; may your foes flee before you."
04Nm 10:36 Whenever it came to rest, he said, "Return, O LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel."
04Nm 11:1 Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the LORD, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the LORD burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.
04Nm 11:2 When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the LORD and the fire died down.
04Nm 11:3 So that place was called Taberah, because fire from the LORD had burned among them.
04Nm 11:4 The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, "If only we had meat to eat!
04Nm 11:5 We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost--also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic.
04Nm 11:6 But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!"
04Nm 11:7 The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.
04Nm 11:8 The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a handmill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. And it tasted like something made with olive oil.
04Nm 11:9 When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down.
04Nm 11:10 Moses heard the people of every family wailing, each at the entrance to his tent. The LORD became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled.
04Nm 11:11 He asked the LORD, "Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me?
04Nm 11:12 Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers?
04Nm 11:13 Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, 'Give us meat to eat!'
04Nm 11:14 I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me.
04Nm 11:15 If this is how you are going to treat me, put me to death right now--if I have found favor in your eyes--and do not let me face my own ruin."
04Nm 11:16 The LORD said to Moses£º "Bring me seventy of Israel's elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.
04Nm 11:17 I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take of the Spirit that is on you and put the Spirit on them. They will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone.
04Nm 11:18 "Tell the people£º 'Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The LORD heard you when you wailed, "If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will eat it.
04Nm 11:19 You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days,
04Nm 11:20 but for a whole month--until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it--because you have rejected the LORD, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?" '"
04Nm 11:21 But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!'
04Nm 11:22 Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?"
04Nm 11:23 The LORD answered Moses, "Is the LORD'S arm too short? You will now see whether or not what I say will come true for you."
04Nm 11:24 So Moses went out and told the people what the LORD had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the Tent.
04Nm 11:25 Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took of the Spirit that was on him and put the Spirit on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did not do so again.
04Nm 11:26 However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the Tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp.
04Nm 11:27 A young man ran and told Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp."
04Nm 11:28 Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' aide since youth, spoke up and said, "Moses, my lord, stop them!"
04Nm 11:29 But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the LORD'S people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit on them!"
04Nm 11:30 Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
04Nm 11:31 Now a wind went out from the LORD and drove quail in from the sea. It brought them down all around the camp to about three feet above the ground, as far as a day's walk in any direction.
04Nm 11:32 All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers. Then they spread them out all around the camp.
04Nm 11:33 But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the LORD burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.
04Nm 11:34 Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had craved other food.
04Nm 11:35 From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
04Nm 12:1 Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite.
04Nm 12:2 "Has the LORD spoken only through Moses?" they asked. "Hasn't he also spoken through us?" And the LORD heard this.
04Nm 12:3 (Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)
04Nm 12:4 At once the LORD said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, "Come out to the Tent of Meeting, all three of you." So the three of them came out.
04Nm 12:5 Then the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the Tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them stepped forward,
04Nm 12:6 he said, "Listen to my words£º "When a prophet of the LORD is among you, I reveal myself to him in visions, I speak to him in dreams.
04Nm 12:7 But this is not true of my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house.
04Nm 12:8 With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?"
04Nm 12:9 The anger of the LORD burned against them, and he left them.
04Nm 12:10 When the cloud lifted from above the Tent, there stood Miriam--leprous, like snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy;
04Nm 12:11 and he said to Moses, "Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed.
04Nm 12:12 Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother's womb with its flesh half eaten away."
04Nm 12:13 So Moses cried out to the LORD, "O God, please heal her!"
04Nm 12:14 The LORD replied to Moses, "If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back."
04Nm 12:15 So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back.
04Nm 12:16 After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran.
04Nm 13:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 13:2 "Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders."
04Nm 13:3 So at the LORD'S command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites.
04Nm 13:4 These are their names£º from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur;
04Nm 13:5 from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;
04Nm 13:6 from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;
04Nm 13:7 from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;
04Nm 13:8 from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;
04Nm 13:9 from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;
04Nm 13:10 from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;
04Nm 13:11 from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;
04Nm 13:12 from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;
04Nm 13:13 from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;
04Nm 13:14 from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;
04Nm 13:15 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.
04Nm 13:16 These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.)
04Nm 13:17 When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, "Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country.
04Nm 13:18 See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.
04Nm 13:19 What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified?
04Nm 13:20 How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land." (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)
04Nm 13:21 So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath.
04Nm 13:22 They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
04Nm 13:23 When they reached the Valley of Eshcol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs.
04Nm 13:24 That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there.
04Nm 13:25 At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.
04Nm 13:26 They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land.
04Nm 13:27 They gave Moses this account£º "We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.
04Nm 13:28 But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there.
04Nm 13:29 The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan."
04Nm 13:30 Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it."
04Nm 13:31 But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are."
04Nm 13:32 And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, "The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size.
04Nm 13:33 We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them."
04Nm 14:1 That night all the people of the community raised their voices and wept aloud.
04Nm 14:2 All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, "If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this desert!
04Nm 14:3 Why is the LORD bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"
04Nm 14:4 And they said to each other, "We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt."
04Nm 14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there.
04Nm 14:6 Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes
04Nm 14:7 and said to the entire Israelite assembly, "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.
04Nm 14:8 If the LORD is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us.
04Nm 14:9 Only do not rebel against the LORD. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will swallow them up. Their protection is gone, but the LORD is with us. Do not be afraid of them."
04Nm 14:10 But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the Tent of Meeting to all the Israelites.
04Nm 14:11 The LORD said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the miraculous signs I have performed among them?
04Nm 14:12 I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they."
04Nm 14:13 Moses said to the LORD, "Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them.
04Nm 14:14 And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, O LORD, are with these people and that you, O LORD, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.
04Nm 14:15 If you put these people to death all at one time, the nations who have heard this report about you will say,
04Nm 14:16 'The LORD was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath; so he slaughtered them in the desert.'
04Nm 14:17 "Now may the Lord's strength be displayed, just as you have declared£º
04Nm 14:18 'The LORD is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation.'
04Nm 14:19 In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now."
04Nm 14:20 The LORD replied, "I have forgiven them, as you asked.
04Nm 14:21 Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the LORD fills the whole earth,
04Nm 14:22 not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs I performed in Egypt and in the desert but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times--
04Nm 14:23 not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their forefathers. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it.
04Nm 14:24 But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it.
04Nm 14:25 Since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea."
04Nm 14:26 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron£º
04Nm 14:27 "How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites.
04Nm 14:28 So tell them, 'As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you the very things I heard you say£º
04Nm 14:29 In this desert your bodies will fall--every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me.
04Nm 14:30 Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04Nm 14:31 As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.
04Nm 14:32 But you--your bodies will fall in this desert.
04Nm 14:33 Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the desert.
04Nm 14:34 For forty years--one year for each of the forty days you explored the land--you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.'
04Nm 14:35 I, the LORD, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this desert; here they will die."
04Nm 14:36 So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it--
04Nm 14:37 these men responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the LORD.
04Nm 14:38 Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived.
04Nm 14:39 When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly.
04Nm 14:40 Early the next morning they went up toward the high hill country. "We have sinned," they said. "We will go up to the place the LORD promised."
04Nm 14:41 But Moses said, "Why are you disobeying the LORD'S command? This will not succeed!
04Nm 14:42 Do not go up, because the LORD is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies,
04Nm 14:43 for the Amalekites and Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the LORD, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword."
04Nm 14:44 Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the high hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the LORD'S covenant moved from the camp.
04Nm 14:45 Then the Amalekites and Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah.
04Nm 15:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 15:2 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'After you enter the land I am giving you as a home
04Nm 15:3 and you present to the LORD offerings made by fire, from the herd or the flock, as an aroma pleasing to the LORD--whether burnt offerings or sacrifices, for special vows or freewill offerings or festival offerings--
04Nm 15:4 then the one who brings his offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil.
04Nm 15:5 With each lamb for the burnt offering or the sacrifice, prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering.
04Nm 15:6 "'With a ram prepare a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil,
04Nm 15:7 and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering. Offer it as an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
04Nm 15:8 "'When you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, for a special vow or a fellowship offering to the LORD,
04Nm 15:9 bring with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil.
04Nm 15:10 Also bring half a hin of wine as a drink offering. It will be an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
04Nm 15:11 Each bull or ram, each lamb or young goat, is to be prepared in this manner.
04Nm 15:12 Do this for each one, for as many as you prepare.
04Nm 15:13 "'Everyone who is native-born must do these things in this way when he brings an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
04Nm 15:14 For the generations to come, whenever an alien or anyone else living among you presents an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the LORD, he must do exactly as you do.
04Nm 15:15 The community is to have the same rules for you and for the alien living among you; this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. You and the alien shall be the same before the LORD£º
04Nm 15:16 The same laws and regulations will apply both to you and to the alien living among you.'"
04Nm 15:17 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 15:18 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'When you enter the land to which I am taking you
04Nm 15:19 and you eat the food of the land, present a portion as an offering to the LORD.
04Nm 15:20 Present a cake from the first of your ground meal and present it as an offering from the threshing floor.
04Nm 15:21 Throughout the generations to come you are to give this offering to the LORD from the first of your ground meal.
04Nm 15:22 "'Now if you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the LORD gave Moses--
04Nm 15:23 any of the LORD'S commands to you through him, from the day the LORD gave them and continuing through the generations to come--
04Nm 15:24 and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it, then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to the LORD, along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering, and a male goat for a sin offering.
04Nm 15:25 The priest is to make atonement for the whole Israelite community, and they will be forgiven, for it was not intentional and they have brought to the LORD for their wrong an offering made by fire and a sin offering.
04Nm 15:26 The whole Israelite community and the aliens living among them will be forgiven, because all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong.
04Nm 15:27 "'But if just one person sins unintentionally, he must bring a year-old female goat for a sin offering.
04Nm 15:28 The priest is to make atonement before the LORD for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally, and when atonement has been made for him, he will be forgiven.
04Nm 15:29 One and the same law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally, whether he is a native-born Israelite or an alien.
04Nm 15:30 "'But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or alien, blasphemes the LORD, and that person must be cut off from his people.
04Nm 15:31 Because he has despised the LORD'S word and broken his commands, that person must surely be cut off; his guilt remains on him.'"
04Nm 15:32 While the Israelites were in the desert, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
04Nm 15:33 Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole assembly,
04Nm 15:34 and they kept him in custody, because it was not clear what should be done to him.
04Nm 15:35 Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp."
04Nm 15:36 So the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 15:37 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 15:38 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'Throughout the generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments, with a blue cord on each tassel.
04Nm 15:39 You will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the LORD, that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by going after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes.
04Nm 15:40 Then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your God.
04Nm 15:41 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God.'"
04Nm 16:1 Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and certain Reubenites--Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth--became insolent
04Nm 16:2 and rose up against Moses. With them were 250 Israelite men, well-known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council.
04Nm 16:3 They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron and said to them, "You have gone too far! The whole community is holy, every one of them, and the LORD is with them. Why then do you set yourselves above the LORD'S assembly?"
04Nm 16:4 When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.
04Nm 16:5 Then he said to Korah and all his followers£º "In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to him and who is holy, and he will have that person come near him. The man he chooses he will cause to come near him.
04Nm 16:6 You, Korah, and all your followers are to do this£º Take censers
04Nm 16:7 and tomorrow put fire and incense in them before the LORD. The man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy. You Levites have gone too far!"
04Nm 16:8 Moses also said to Korah, "Now listen, you Levites!
04Nm 16:9 Isn't it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the LORD'S tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them?
04Nm 16:10 He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near himself, but now you are trying to get the priesthood too.
04Nm 16:11 It is against the LORD that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?"
04Nm 16:12 Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab. But they said, "We will not come!
04Nm 16:13 Isn't it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert? And now you also want to lord it over us?
04Nm 16:14 Moreover, you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? No, we will not come!"
04Nm 16:15 Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them."
04Nm 16:16 Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers are to appear before the LORD tomorrow--you and they and Aaron.
04Nm 16:17 Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it--250 censers in all--and present it before the LORD. You and Aaron are to present your censers also."
04Nm 16:18 So each man took his censer, put fire and incense in it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 16:19 When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of the LORD appeared to the entire assembly.
04Nm 16:20 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 16:21 "Separate yourselves from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once."
04Nm 16:22 But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried out, "O God, God of the spirits of all mankind, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?"
04Nm 16:23 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 16:24 "Say to the assembly, 'Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.'"
04Nm 16:25 Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
04Nm 16:26 He warned the assembly, "Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything belonging to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins."
04Nm 16:27 So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing with their wives, children and little ones at the entrances to their tents.
04Nm 16:28 Then Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea£º
04Nm 16:29 If these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men, then the LORD has not sent me.
04Nm 16:30 But if the LORD brings about something totally new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them, with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into the grave, then you will know that these men have treated the LORD with contempt."
04Nm 16:31 As soon as he finished saying all this, the ground under them split apart
04Nm 16:32 and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their households and all Korah's men and all their possessions.
04Nm 16:33 They went down alive into the grave, with everything they owned; the earth closed over them, and they perished and were gone from the community.
04Nm 16:34 At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, "The earth is going to swallow us too!"
04Nm 16:35 And fire came out from the LORD and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.
04Nm 16:36 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 16:37 "Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy--
04Nm 16:38 the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar, for they were presented before the LORD and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites."
04Nm 16:39 So Eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up, and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar,
04Nm 16:40 as the LORD directed him through Moses. This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the LORD, or he would become like Korah and his followers.
04Nm 16:41 The next day the whole Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. "You have killed the LORD'S people," they said.
04Nm 16:42 But when the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the Tent of Meeting, suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the LORD appeared.
04Nm 16:43 Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the Tent of Meeting,
04Nm 16:44 and the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 16:45 "Get away from this assembly so I can put an end to them at once." And they fell facedown.
04Nm 16:46 Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer and put incense in it, along with fire from the altar, and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has come out from the LORD; the plague has started."
04Nm 16:47 So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already started among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.
04Nm 16:48 He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.
04Nm 16:49 But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.
04Nm 16:50 Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, for the plague had stopped.
04Nm 17:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 17:2 "Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff.
04Nm 17:3 On the staff of Levi write Aaron's name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe.
04Nm 17:4 Place them in the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I meet with you.
04Nm 17:5 The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites."
04Nm 17:6 So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron's staff was among them.
04Nm 17:7 Moses placed the staffs before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony.
04Nm 17:8 The next day Moses entered the Tent of the Testimony and saw that Aaron's staff, which represented the house of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds.
04Nm 17:9 Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the LORD'S presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each man took his own staff.
04Nm 17:10 The LORD said to Moses, "Put back Aaron's staff in front of the Testimony, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die."
04Nm 17:11 Moses did just as the LORD commanded him.
04Nm 17:12 The Israelites said to Moses, "We will die! We are lost, we are all lost!
04Nm 17:13 Anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the LORD will die. Are we all going to die?"
04Nm 18:1 The LORD said to Aaron, "You, your sons and your father's family are to bear the responsibility for offenses against the sanctuary, and you and your sons alone are to bear the responsibility for offenses against the priesthood.
04Nm 18:2 Bring your fellow Levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the Tent of the Testimony.
04Nm 18:3 They are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the Tent, but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar, or both they and you will die.
04Nm 18:4 They are to join you and be responsible for the care of the Tent of Meeting--all the work at the Tent--and no one else may come near where you are.
04Nm 18:5 "You are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar, so that wrath will not fall on the Israelites again.
04Nm 18:6 I myself have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD to do the work at the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 18:7 But only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain. I am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift. Anyone else who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death."
04Nm 18:8 Then the LORD said to Aaron, "I myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me; all the holy offerings the Israelites give me I give to you and your sons as your portion and regular share.
04Nm 18:9 You are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire. From all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings, whether grain or sin or guilt offerings, that part belongs to you and your sons.
04Nm 18:10 Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. You must regard it as holy.
04Nm 18:11 "This also is yours£º whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I give this to you and your sons and daughters as your regular share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
04Nm 18:12 "I give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the LORD as the firstfruits of their harvest.
04Nm 18:13 All the land's firstfruits that they bring to the LORD will be yours. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.
04Nm 18:14 "Everything in Israel that is devoted to the LORD is yours.
04Nm 18:15 The first offspring of every womb, both man and animal, that is offered to the LORD is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals.
04Nm 18:16 When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which weighs twenty gerahs.
04Nm 18:17 "But you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep or a goat; they are holy. Sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
04Nm 18:18 Their meat is to be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours.
04Nm 18:19 Whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the Israelites present to the LORD I give to you and your sons and daughters as your regular share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the LORD for both you and your offspring."
04Nm 18:20 The LORD said to Aaron, "You will have no inheritance in their land, nor will you have any share among them; I am your share and your inheritance among the Israelites.
04Nm 18:21 "I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 18:22 From now on the Israelites must not go near the Tent of Meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die.
04Nm 18:23 It is the Levites who are to do the work at the Tent of Meeting and bear the responsibility for offenses against it. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. They will receive no inheritance among the Israelites.
04Nm 18:24 Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the LORD. That is why I said concerning them£º 'They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.'"
04Nm 18:25 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 18:26 "Speak to the Levites and say to them£º 'When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must present a tenth of that tithe as the LORD'S offering.
04Nm 18:27 Your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress.
04Nm 18:28 In this way you also will present an offering to the LORD from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes you must give the LORD'S portion to Aaron the priest.
04Nm 18:29 You must present as the LORD'S portion the best and holiest part of everything given to you.'
04Nm 18:30 "Say to the Levites£º 'When you present the best part, it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress.
04Nm 18:31 You and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere, for it is your wages for your work at the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 18:32 By presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will not die.'"
04Nm 19:1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron£º
04Nm 19:2 "This is a requirement of the law that the LORD has commanded£º Tell the Israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke.
04Nm 19:3 Give it to Eleazar the priest; it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
04Nm 19:4 Then Eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 19:5 While he watches, the heifer is to be burned--its hide, flesh, blood and offal.
04Nm 19:6 The priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer.
04Nm 19:7 After that, the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water. He may then come into the camp, but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening.
04Nm 19:8 The man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water, and he too will be unclean till evening.
04Nm 19:9 "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp. They shall be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of cleansing; it is for purification from sin.
04Nm 19:10 The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he too will be unclean till evening. This will be a lasting ordinance both for the Israelites and for the aliens living among them.
04Nm 19:11 "Whoever touches the dead body of anyone will be unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:12 He must purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days, he will not be clean.
04Nm 19:13 Whoever touches the dead body of anyone and fails to purify himself defiles the LORD'S tabernacle. That person must be cut off from Israel. Because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, he is unclean; his uncleanness remains on him.
04Nm 19:14 "This is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent£º Anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days,
04Nm 19:15 and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean.
04Nm 19:16 "Anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death, or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:17 "For the unclean person, put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them.
04Nm 19:18 Then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop, dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or someone who has been killed or someone who has died a natural death.
04Nm 19:19 The man who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he is to purify him. The person being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe with water, and that evening he will be clean.
04Nm 19:20 But if a person who is unclean does not purify himself, he must be cut off from the community, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him, and he is unclean.
04Nm 19:21 This is a lasting ordinance for them. "The man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening.
04Nm 19:22 Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it becomes unclean till evening."
04Nm 20:1 In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.
04Nm 20:2 Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 20:3 They quarreled with Moses and said, "If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the LORD!
04Nm 20:4 Why did you bring the LORD'S community into this desert, that we and our livestock should die here?
04Nm 20:5 Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!"
04Nm 20:6 Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the LORD appeared to them.
04Nm 20:7 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 20:8 "Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink."
04Nm 20:9 So Moses took the staff from the LORD'S presence, just as he commanded him.
04Nm 20:10 He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, "Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?"
04Nm 20:11 Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.
04Nm 20:12 But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them."
04Nm 20:13 These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the LORD and where he showed himself holy among them.
04Nm 20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying£º "This is what your brother Israel says£º You know about all the hardships that have come upon us.
04Nm 20:15 Our forefathers went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers,
04Nm 20:16 but when we cried out to the LORD, he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. "Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.
04Nm 20:17 Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the king's highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory."
04Nm 20:18 But Edom answered£º "You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword."
04Nm 20:19 The Israelites replied£º "We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot--nothing else."
04Nm 20:20 Again they answered£º "You may not pass through." Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army.
04Nm 20:21 Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them.
04Nm 20:22 The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.
04Nm 20:23 At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 20:24 "Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.
04Nm 20:25 Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor.
04Nm 20:26 Remove Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there."
04Nm 20:27 Moses did as the LORD commanded£º They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.
04Nm 20:28 Moses removed Aaron's garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain,
04Nm 20:29 and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, the entire house of Israel mourned for him thirty days.
04Nm 21:1 When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them.
04Nm 21:2 Then Israel made this vow to the LORD£º "If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy their cities."
04Nm 21:3 The LORD listened to Israel's plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah.
04Nm 21:4 They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea, to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way;
04Nm 21:5 they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the desert? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!"
04Nm 21:6 Then the LORD sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died.
04Nm 21:7 The people came to Moses and said, "We sinned when we spoke against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take the snakes away from us." So Moses prayed for the people.
04Nm 21:8 The LORD said to Moses, "Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live."
04Nm 21:9 So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, he lived.
04Nm 21:10 The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.
04Nm 21:11 Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the desert that faces Moab toward the sunrise.
04Nm 21:12 From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.
04Nm 21:13 They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the desert extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.
04Nm 21:14 That is why the Book of the Wars of the LORD says£º ". . . Waheb in Suphah and the ravines, the Arnon
04Nm 21:15 and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab."
04Nm 21:16 From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Gather the people together and I will give them water."
04Nm 21:17 Then Israel sang this song£º "Spring up, O well! Sing about it,
04Nm 21:18 about the well that the princes dug, that the nobles of the people sank--the nobles with scepters and staffs." Then they went from the desert to Mattanah,
04Nm 21:19 from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
04Nm 21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.
04Nm 21:21 Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites£º
04Nm 21:22 "Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the king's highway until we have passed through your territory."
04Nm 21:23 But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the desert against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel.
04Nm 21:24 Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified.
04Nm 21:25 Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements.
04Nm 21:26 Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon.
04Nm 21:27 That is why the poets say£º "Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon's city be restored.
04Nm 21:28 "Fire went out from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab, the citizens of Arnon's heights.
04Nm 21:29 Woe to you, O Moab! You are destroyed, O people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to Sihon king of the Amorites.
04Nm 21:30 "But we have overthrown them; Heshbon is destroyed all the way to Dibon. We have demolished them as far as Nophah, which extends to Medeba."
04Nm 21:31 So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.
04Nm 21:32 After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there.
04Nm 21:33 Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei.
04Nm 21:34 The LORD said to Moses, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you, with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon."
04Nm 21:35 So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land.
04Nm 22:1 Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.
04Nm 22:2 Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,
04Nm 22:3 and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites.
04Nm 22:4 The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field." So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time,
04Nm 22:5 sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the River, in his native land. Balak said£º "A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.
04Nm 22:6 Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the country. For I know that those you bless are blessed, and those you curse are cursed."
04Nm 22:7 The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.
04Nm 22:8 "Spend the night here," Balaam said to them, "and I will bring you back the answer the LORD gives me." So the Moabite princes stayed with him.
04Nm 22:9 God came to Balaam and asked, "Who are these men with you?"
04Nm 22:10 Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message£º
04Nm 22:11 'A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.'"
04Nm 22:12 But God said to Balaam, "Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed."
04Nm 22:13 The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak's princes, "Go back to your own country, for the LORD has refused to let me go with you."
04Nm 22:14 So the Moabite princes returned to Balak and said, "Balaam refused to come with us."
04Nm 22:15 Then Balak sent other princes, more numerous and more distinguished than the first.
04Nm 22:16 They came to Balaam and said£º "This is what Balak son of Zippor says£º Do not let anything keep you from coming to me,
04Nm 22:17 because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me."
04Nm 22:18 But Balaam answered them, "Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the LORD my God.
04Nm 22:19 Now stay here tonight as the others did, and I will find out what else the LORD will tell me."
04Nm 22:20 That night God came to Balaam and said, "Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you."
04Nm 22:21 Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the princes of Moab.
04Nm 22:22 But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the LORD stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
04Nm 22:23 When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, she turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat her to get her back on the road.
04Nm 22:24 Then the angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with walls on both sides.
04Nm 22:25 When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against it. So he beat her again.
04Nm 22:26 Then the angel of the LORD moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.
04Nm 22:27 When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat her with his staff.
04Nm 22:28 Then the LORD opened the donkey's mouth, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?"
04Nm 22:29 Balaam answered the donkey, "You have made a fool of me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now."
04Nm 22:30 The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?" "No," he said.
04Nm 22:31 Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.
04Nm 22:32 The angel of the LORD asked him, "Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.
04Nm 22:33 The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared her."
04Nm 22:34 Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back."
04Nm 22:35 The angel of the LORD said to Balaam, "Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you." So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
04Nm 22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.
04Nm 22:37 Balak said to Balaam, "Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn't you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?"
04Nm 22:38 "Well, I have come to you now," Balaam replied. "But can I say just anything? I must speak only what God puts in my mouth."
04Nm 22:39 Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.
04Nm 22:40 Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the princes who were with him.
04Nm 22:41 The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he saw part of the people.
04Nm 23:1 Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
04Nm 23:2 Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 23:3 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you." Then he went off to a barren height.
04Nm 23:4 God met with him, and Balaam said, "I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram."
04Nm 23:5 The LORD put a message in Balaam's mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."
04Nm 23:6 So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the princes of Moab.
04Nm 23:7 Then Balaam uttered his oracle£º "Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. 'Come,' he said, 'curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.'
04Nm 23:8 How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom the LORD has not denounced?
04Nm 23:9 From the rocky peaks I see them, from the heights I view them. I see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations.
04Nm 23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my end be like theirs!"
04Nm 23:11 Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!"
04Nm 23:12 He answered, "Must I not speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?"
04Nm 23:13 Then Balak said to him, "Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will see only a part but not all of them. And from there, curse them for me."
04Nm 23:14 So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 23:15 Balaam said to Balak, "Stay here beside your offering while I meet with him over there."
04Nm 23:16 The LORD met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, "Go back to Balak and give him this message."
04Nm 23:17 So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering, with the princes of Moab. Balak asked him, "What did the LORD say?"
04Nm 23:18 Then he uttered his oracle£º "Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.
04Nm 23:19 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill?
04Nm 23:20 I have received a command to bless; he has blessed, and I cannot change it.
04Nm 23:21 "No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery observed in Israel. The LORD their God is with them; the shout of the King is among them.
04Nm 23:22 God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox.
04Nm 23:23 There is no sorcery against Jacob, no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and of Israel, 'See what God has done!'
04Nm 23:24 The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till he devours his prey and drinks the blood of his victims."
04Nm 23:25 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!"
04Nm 23:26 Balaam answered, "Did I not tell you I must do whatever the LORD says?"
04Nm 23:27 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there."
04Nm 23:28 And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.
04Nm 23:29 Balaam said, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me."
04Nm 23:30 Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 24:1 Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not resort to sorcery as at other times, but turned his face toward the desert.
04Nm 24:2 When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came upon him
04Nm 24:3 and he uttered his oracle£º "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,
04Nm 24:4 the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened£º
04Nm 24:5 "How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob, your dwelling places, O Israel!
04Nm 24:6 "Like valleys they spread out, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters.
04Nm 24:7 Water will flow from their buckets; their seed will have abundant water. "Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted.
04Nm 24:8 "God brought them out of Egypt; they have the strength of a wild ox. They devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces; with their arrows they pierce them.
04Nm 24:9 Like a lion they crouch and lie down, like a lioness--who dares to rouse them? "May those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed!"
04Nm 24:10 Then Balak's anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to him, "I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times.
04Nm 24:11 Now leave at once and go home! I said I would reward you handsomely, but the LORD has kept you from being rewarded."
04Nm 24:12 Balaam answered Balak, "Did I not tell the messengers you sent me,
04Nm 24:13 'Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything of my own accord, good or bad, to go beyond the command of the LORD--and I must say only what the LORD says'?
04Nm 24:14 Now I am going back to my people, but come, let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come."
04Nm 24:15 Then he uttered his oracle£º "The oracle of Balaam son of Beor, the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly,
04Nm 24:16 the oracle of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened£º
04Nm 24:17 "I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob; a scepter will rise out of Israel. He will crush the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of all the sons of Sheth.
04Nm 24:18 Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered, but Israel will grow strong.
04Nm 24:19 A ruler will come out of Jacob and destroy the survivors of the city."
04Nm 24:20 Then Balaam saw Amalek and uttered his oracle£º "Amalek was first among the nations, but he will come to ruin at last."
04Nm 24:21 Then he saw the Kenites and uttered his oracle£º "Your dwelling place is secure, your nest is set in a rock;
04Nm 24:22 yet you Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive."
04Nm 24:23 Then he uttered his oracle£º "Ah, who can live when God does this?
04Nm 24:24 Ships will come from the shores of Kittim; they will subdue Asshur and Eber, but they too will come to ruin."
04Nm 24:25 Then Balaam got up and returned home and Balak went his own way.
04Nm 25:1 While Israel was staying in Shittim, the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with Moabite women,
04Nm 25:2 who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods. The people ate and bowed down before these gods.
04Nm 25:3 So Israel joined in worshiping the Baal of Peor. And the LORD'S anger burned against them.
04Nm 25:4 The LORD said to Moses, "Take all the leaders of these people, kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the LORD'S fierce anger may turn away from Israel."
04Nm 25:5 So Moses said to Israel's judges, "Each of you must put to death those of your men who have joined in worshiping the Baal of Peor."
04Nm 25:6 Then an Israelite man brought to his family a Midianite woman right before the eyes of Moses and the whole assembly of Israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting.
04Nm 25:7 When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand
04Nm 25:8 and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear through both of them--through the Israelite and into the woman's body. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped;
04Nm 25:9 but those who died in the plague numbered 24,000.
04Nm 25:10 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 25:11 "Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites; for he was as zealous as I am for my honor among them, so that in my zeal I did not put an end to them.
04Nm 25:12 Therefore tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him.
04Nm 25:13 He and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood, because he was zealous for the honor of his God and made atonement for the Israelites."
04Nm 25:14 The name of the Israelite who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a Simeonite family.
04Nm 25:15 And the name of the Midianite woman who was put to death was Cozbi daughter of Zur, a tribal chief of a Midianite family.
04Nm 25:16 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 25:17 "Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them,
04Nm 25:18 because they treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the affair of Peor and their sister Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of Peor."
04Nm 26:1 After the plague the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest,
04Nm 26:2 "Take a census of the whole Israelite community by families--all those twenty years old or more who are able to serve in the army of Israel."
04Nm 26:3 So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them and said,
04Nm 26:4 "Take a census of the men twenty years old or more, as the LORD commanded Moses." These were the Israelites who came out of Egypt£º
04Nm 26:5 The descendants of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were£º through Hanoch, the Hanochite clan; through Pallu, the Palluite clan;
04Nm 26:6 through Hezron, the Hezronite clan; through Carmi, the Carmite clan.
04Nm 26:7 These were the clans of Reuben; those numbered were 43,730.
04Nm 26:8 The son of Pallu was Eliab,
04Nm 26:9 and the sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. The same Dathan and Abiram were the community officials who rebelled against Moses and Aaron and were among Korah's followers when they rebelled against the LORD.
04Nm 26:10 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died when the fire devoured the 250 men. And they served as a warning sign.
04Nm 26:11 The line of Korah, however, did not die out.
04Nm 26:12 The descendants of Simeon by their clans were£º through Nemuel, the Nemuelite clan; through Jamin, the Jaminite clan; through Jakin, the Jakinite clan;

04Nm 26:33 (Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons; he had only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah.)
04Nm 26:34 These were the clans of Manasseh; those numbered were 52,700.
04Nm 26:35 These were the descendants of Ephraim by their clans£º through Shuthelah, the Shuthelahite clan; through Beker, the Bekerite clan; through Tahan, the Tahanite clan.
04Nm 26:36 These were the descendants of Shuthelah£º through Eran, the Eranite clan.
04Nm 26:37 These were the clans of Ephraim; those numbered were 32,500. These were the descendants of Joseph by their clans.
04Nm 26:38 The descendants of Benjamin by their clans were£º through Bela, the Belaite clan; through Ashbel, the Ashbelite clan; through Ahiram, the Ahiramite clan;
04Nm 26:39 through Shupham, the Shuphamite clan; through Hupham, the Huphamite clan.

04Nm 26:41 These were the clans of Benjamin; those numbered were 45,600.
04Nm 26:42 These were the descendants of Dan by their clans£º through Shuham, the Shuhamite clan. These were the clans of Dan£º
04Nm 26:43 All of them were Shuhamite clans; and those numbered were 64,400.
04Nm 26:44 The descendants of Asher by their clans were£º through Imnah, the Imnite clan; through Ishvi, the Ishvite clan; through Beriah, the Beriite clan;
04Nm 26:45 and through the descendants of Beriah£º through Heber, the Heberite clan; through Malkiel, the Malkielite clan.
04Nm 26:46 (Asher had a daughter named Serah.)
04Nm 26:47 These were the clans of Asher; those numbered were 53,400.
04Nm 26:48 The descendants of Naphtali by their clans were£º through Jahzeel, the Jahzeelite clan; through Guni, the Gunite clan;
04Nm 26:49 through Jezer, the Jezerite clan; through Shillem, the Shillemite clan.
04Nm 26:50 These were the clans of Naphtali; those numbered were 45,400.
04Nm 26:51 The total number of the men of Israel was 601,730.
04Nm 26:52 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 26:53 "The land is to be allotted to them as an inheritance based on the number of names.
04Nm 26:54 To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one; each is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those listed.
04Nm 26:55 Be sure that the land is distributed by lot. What each group inherits will be according to the names for its ancestral tribe.
04Nm 26:56 Each inheritance is to be distributed by lot among the larger and smaller groups."
04Nm 26:57 These were the Levites who were counted by their clans£º through Gershon, the Gershonite clan; through Kohath, the Kohathite clan; through Merari, the Merarite clan.
04Nm 26:58 These also were Levite clans£º the Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, the Korahite clan. (Kohath was the forefather of Amram;
04Nm 26:59 the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, a descendant of Levi, who was born to the Levites in Egypt. To Amram she bore Aaron, Moses and their sister Miriam.
04Nm 26:60 Aaron was the father of Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
04Nm 26:61 But Nadab and Abihu died when they made an offering before the LORD with unauthorized fire.)
04Nm 26:62 All the male Levites a month old or more numbered 23,000. They were not counted along with the other Israelites because they received no inheritance among them.
04Nm 26:63 These are the ones counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they counted the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
04Nm 26:64 Not one of them was among those counted by Moses and Aaron the priest when they counted the Israelites in the Desert of Sinai.
04Nm 26:65 For the LORD had told those Israelites they would surely die in the desert, and not one of them was left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04Nm 27:1 The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. They approached
04Nm 27:2 the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders and the whole assembly, and said,
04Nm 27:3 "Our father died in the desert. He was not among Korah's followers, who banded together against the LORD, but he died for his own sin and left no sons.
04Nm 27:4 Why should our father's name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father's relatives."
04Nm 27:5 So Moses brought their case before the LORD
04Nm 27:6 and the LORD said to him,
04Nm 27:7 "What Zelophehad's daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father's relatives and turn their father's inheritance over to them.
04Nm 27:8 "Say to the Israelites, 'If a man dies and leaves no son, turn his inheritance over to his daughter.
04Nm 27:9 If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers.
04Nm 27:10 If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
04Nm 27:11 If his father had no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, that he may possess it. This is to be a legal requirement for the Israelites, as the LORD commanded Moses.'"
04Nm 27:12 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go up this mountain in the Abarim range and see the land I have given the Israelites.
04Nm 27:13 After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was,
04Nm 27:14 for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes." (These were the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.)
04Nm 27:15 Moses said to the LORD,
04Nm 27:16 "May the LORD, the God of the spirits of all mankind, appoint a man over this community
04Nm 27:17 to go out and come in before them, one who will lead them out and bring them in, so the LORD'S people will not be like sheep without a shepherd."
04Nm 27:18 So the LORD said to Moses, "Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay your hand on him.
04Nm 27:19 Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission him in their presence.
04Nm 27:20 Give him some of your authority so the whole Israelite community will obey him.
04Nm 27:21 He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the LORD. At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out, and at his command they will come in."
04Nm 27:22 Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly.
04Nm 27:23 Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the LORD instructed through Moses.
04Nm 28:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 28:2 "Give this command to the Israelites and say to them£º 'See that you present to me at the appointed time the food for my offerings made by fire, as an aroma pleasing to me.'
04Nm 28:3 Say to them£º 'This is the offering made by fire that you are to present to the LORD£º two lambs a year old without defect, as a regular burnt offering each day.
04Nm 28:4 Prepare one lamb in the morning and the other at twilight,
04Nm 28:5 together with a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil from pressed olives.
04Nm 28:6 This is the regular burnt offering instituted at Mount Sinai as a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire.
04Nm 28:7 The accompanying drink offering is to be a quarter of a hin of fermented drink with each lamb. Pour out the drink offering to the LORD at the sanctuary.
04Nm 28:8 Prepare the second lamb at twilight, along with the same kind of grain offering and drink offering that you prepare in the morning. This is an offering made by fire, an aroma pleasing to the LORD.
04Nm 28:9 "'On the Sabbath day, make an offering of two lambs a year old without defect, together with its drink offering and a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil.
04Nm 28:10 This is the burnt offering for every Sabbath, in addition to the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.
04Nm 28:11 "'On the first of every month, present to the LORD a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect.
04Nm 28:12 With each bull there is to be a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil; with the ram, a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil;
04Nm 28:13 and with each lamb, a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil. This is for a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering made to the LORD by fire.
04Nm 28:14 With each bull there is to be a drink offering of half a hin of wine; with the ram, a third of a hin; and with each lamb, a quarter of a hin. This is the monthly burnt offering to be made at each new moon during the year.
04Nm 28:15 Besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering, one male goat is to be presented to the LORD as a sin offering.
04Nm 28:16 "'On the fourteenth day of the first month the LORD'S Passover is to be held.
04Nm 28:17 On the fifteenth day of this month there is to be a festival; for seven days eat bread made without yeast.
04Nm 28:18 On the first day hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.
04Nm 28:19 Present to the LORD an offering made by fire, a burnt offering of two young bulls, one ram and seven male lambs a year old, all without defect.

04Nm 28:22 Include one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you.
04Nm 28:23 Prepare these in addition to the regular morning burnt offering.

04Nm 29:40 Moses told the Israelites all that the LORD commanded him.
04Nm 30:1 Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel£º "This is what the LORD commands£º
04Nm 30:2 When a man makes a vow to the LORD or takes an oath to obligate himself by a pledge, he must not break his word but must do everything he said.
04Nm 30:3 "When a young woman still living in her father's house makes a vow to the LORD or obligates herself by a pledge
04Nm 30:4 and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her, then all her vows and every pledge by which she obligated herself will stand.
04Nm 30:5 But if her father forbids her when he hears about it, none of her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand; the LORD will release her because her father has forbidden her.
04Nm 30:6 "If she marries after she makes a vow or after her lips utter a rash promise by which she obligates herself
04Nm 30:7 and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her, then her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand.
04Nm 30:8 But if her husband forbids her when he hears about it, he nullifies the vow that obligates her or the rash promise by which she obligates herself, and the LORD will release her.
04Nm 30:9 "Any vow or obligation taken by a widow or divorced woman will be binding on her.
04Nm 30:10 "If a woman living with her husband makes a vow or obligates herself by a pledge under oath
04Nm 30:11 and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her and does not forbid her, then all her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand.
04Nm 30:12 But if her husband nullifies them when he hears about them, then none of the vows or pledges that came from her lips will stand. Her husband has nullified them, and the LORD will release her.
04Nm 30:13 Her husband may confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny herself.
04Nm 30:14 But if her husband says nothing to her about it from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or the pledges binding on her. He confirms them by saying nothing to her when he hears about them.
04Nm 30:15 If, however, he nullifies them some time after he hears about them, then he is responsible for her guilt."
04Nm 30:16 These are the regulations the LORD gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife, and between a father and his young daughter still living in his house.
04Nm 31:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 31:2 "Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people."
04Nm 31:3 So Moses said to the people, "Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites and to carry out the LORD'S vengeance on them.
04Nm 31:4 Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel."
04Nm 31:5 So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel.
04Nm 31:6 Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling.
04Nm 31:7 They fought against Midian, as the LORD commanded Moses, and killed every man.
04Nm 31:8 Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba--the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
04Nm 31:9 The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder.
04Nm 31:10 They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps.
04Nm 31:11 They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals,
04Nm 31:12 and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho.
04Nm 31:13 Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.
04Nm 31:14 Moses was angry with the officers of the army--the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds--who returned from the battle.
04Nm 31:15 "Have you allowed all the women to live?" he asked them.
04Nm 31:16 "They were the ones who followed Balaam's advice and were the means of turning the Israelites away from the LORD in what happened at Peor, so that a plague struck the LORD'S people.
04Nm 31:17 Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man,
04Nm 31:18 but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man.
04Nm 31:19 "All of you who have killed anyone or touched anyone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives.
04Nm 31:20 Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood."
04Nm 31:21 Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, "This is the requirement of the law that the LORD gave Moses£º
04Nm 31:22 Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead
04Nm 31:23 and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water.
04Nm 31:24 On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp."
04Nm 31:25 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 31:26 "You and Eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured.
04Nm 31:27 Divide the spoils between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community.
04Nm 31:28 From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the LORD one out of every five hundred, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep or goats.
04Nm 31:29 Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the LORD'S part.
04Nm 31:30 From the Israelites' half, select one out of every fifty, whether persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats or other animals. Give them to the Levites, who are responsible for the care of the LORD'S tabernacle."
04Nm 31:31 So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:32 The plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675,000 sheep,
04Nm 31:33 72,000 cattle,
04Nm 31:34 61,000 donkeys
04Nm 31:35 and 32,000 women who had never slept with a man.
04Nm 31:36 The half share of those who fought in the battle was£º 337,500 sheep,
04Nm 31:37 of which the tribute for the LORD was 675;
04Nm 31:38 36,000 cattle, of which the tribute for the LORD was 72;
04Nm 31:39 30,500 donkeys, of which the tribute for the LORD was 61;
04Nm 31:40 16,000 people, of which the tribute for the LORD was 32.
04Nm 31:41 Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar the priest as the LORD'S part, as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:42 The half belonging to the Israelites, which Moses set apart from that of the fighting men--
04Nm 31:43 the community's half--was 337,500 sheep,
04Nm 31:44 36,000 cattle,
04Nm 31:45 30,500 donkeys
04Nm 31:46 and 16,000 people.
04Nm 31:47 From the Israelites' half, Moses selected one out of every fifty persons and animals, as the LORD commanded him, and gave them to the Levites, who were responsible for the care of the LORD'S tabernacle.
04Nm 31:48 Then the officers who were over the units of the army--the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds--went to Moses
04Nm 31:49 and said to him, "Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and not one is missing.
04Nm 31:50 So we have brought as an offering to the LORD the gold articles each of us acquired--armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces--to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD."
04Nm 31:51 Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold--all the crafted articles.
04Nm 31:52 All the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that Moses and Eleazar presented as a gift to the LORD weighed 16,750 shekels.
04Nm 31:53 Each soldier had taken plunder for himself.
04Nm 31:54 Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD.
04Nm 32:1 The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.
04Nm 32:2 So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said,
04Nm 32:3 "Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon--
04Nm 32:4 the land the LORD subdued before the people of Israel--are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock.
04Nm 32:5 If we have found favor in your eyes," they said, "let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan."
04Nm 32:6 Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, "Shall your countrymen go to war while you sit here?
04Nm 32:7 Why do you discourage the Israelites from going over into the land the LORD has given them?
04Nm 32:8 This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land.
04Nm 32:9 After they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the LORD had given them.
04Nm 32:10 The LORD'S anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath£º
04Nm 32:11 'Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years old or more who came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--
04Nm 32:12 not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the LORD wholeheartedly.'
04Nm 32:13 The LORD'S anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the desert forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone.
04Nm 32:14 "And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the LORD even more angry with Israel.
04Nm 32:15 If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the desert, and you will be the cause of their destruction."
04Nm 32:16 Then they came up to him and said, "We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children.
04Nm 32:17 But we are ready to arm ourselves and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land.
04Nm 32:18 We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has received his inheritance.
04Nm 32:19 We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan."
04Nm 32:20 Then Moses said to them, "If you will do this--if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle,
04Nm 32:21 and if all of you will go armed over the Jordan before the LORD until he has driven his enemies out before him--
04Nm 32:22 then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free from your obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the LORD.
04Nm 32:23 "But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the LORD; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.
04Nm 32:24 Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised."
04Nm 32:25 The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, "We your servants will do as our lord commands.
04Nm 32:26 Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead.
04Nm 32:27 But your servants, every man armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the LORD, just as our lord says."
04Nm 32:28 Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes.
04Nm 32:29 He said to them, "If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the LORD, then when the land is subdued before you, give them the land of Gilead as their possession.
04Nm 32:30 But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan."
04Nm 32:31 The Gadites and Reubenites answered, "Your servants will do what the LORD has said.
04Nm 32:32 We will cross over before the LORD into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan."
04Nm 32:33 Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan--the whole land with its cities and the territory around them.
04Nm 32:34 The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
04Nm 32:35 Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
04Nm 32:36 Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks.
04Nm 32:37 And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim,
04Nm 32:38 as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt.
04Nm 32:39 The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there.
04Nm 32:40 So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there.
04Nm 32:41 Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and called them Havvoth Jair.
04Nm 32:42 And Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it Nobah after himself.
04Nm 33:1 Here are the stages in the journey of the Israelites when they came out of Egypt by divisions under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 33:2 At the LORD'S command Moses recorded the stages in their journey. This is their journey by stages£º
04Nm 33:3 The Israelites set out from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month, the day after the Passover. They marched out boldly in full view of all the Egyptians,
04Nm 33:4 who were burying all their firstborn, whom the LORD had struck down among them; for the LORD had brought judgment on their gods.
04Nm 33:5 The Israelites left Rameses and camped at Succoth.
04Nm 33:6 They left Succoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the desert.
04Nm 33:7 They left Etham, turned back to Pi Hahiroth, to the east of Baal Zephon, and camped near Migdol.
04Nm 33:8 They left Pi Hahiroth and passed through the sea into the desert, and when they had traveled for three days in the Desert of Etham, they camped at Marah.
04Nm 33:9 They left Marah and went to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees, and they camped there.
04Nm 33:10 They left Elim and camped by the Red Sea.
04Nm 33:11 They left the Red Sea and camped in the Desert of Sin.
04Nm 33:12 They left the Desert of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
04Nm 33:13 They left Dophkah and camped at Alush.
04Nm 33:14 They left Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
04Nm 33:15 They left Rephidim and camped in the Desert of Sinai.
04Nm 33:16 They left the Desert of Sinai and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.
04Nm 33:17 They left Kibroth Hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
04Nm 33:18 They left Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
04Nm 33:19 They left Rithmah and camped at Rimmon Perez.
04Nm 33:20 They left Rimmon Perez and camped at Libnah.
04Nm 33:21 They left Libnah and camped at Rissah.
04Nm 33:22 They left Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
04Nm 33:23 They left Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
04Nm 33:24 They left Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
04Nm 33:25 They left Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
04Nm 33:26 They left Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
04Nm 33:27 They left Tahath and camped at Terah.
04Nm 33:28 They left Terah and camped at Mithcah.
04Nm 33:29 They left Mithcah and camped at Hashmonah.
04Nm 33:30 They left Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
04Nm 33:31 They left Moseroth and camped at Bene Jaakan.
04Nm 33:32 They left Bene Jaakan and camped at Hor Haggidgad.
04Nm 33:33 They left Hor Haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
04Nm 33:34 They left Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
04Nm 33:35 They left Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber.
04Nm 33:36 They left Ezion Geber and camped at Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.
04Nm 33:37 They left Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the border of Edom.
04Nm 33:38 At the LORD'S command Aaron the priest went up Mount Hor, where he died on the first day of the fifth month of the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of Egypt.
04Nm 33:39 Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.
04Nm 33:40 The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev of Canaan, heard that the Israelites were coming.
04Nm 33:41 They left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
04Nm 33:42 They left Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
04Nm 33:43 They left Punon and camped at Oboth.
04Nm 33:44 They left Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim, on the border of Moab.
04Nm 33:45 They left Iyim and camped at Dibon Gad.
04Nm 33:46 They left Dibon Gad and camped at Almon Diblathaim.
04Nm 33:47 They left Almon Diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, near Nebo.
04Nm 33:48 They left the mountains of Abarim and camped on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
04Nm 33:49 There on the plains of Moab they camped along the Jordan from Beth Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim.
04Nm 33:50 On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 33:51 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'When you cross the Jordan into Canaan,
04Nm 33:52 drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images and their cast idols, and demolish all their high places.
04Nm 33:53 Take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess.
04Nm 33:54 Distribute the land by lot, according to your clans. To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one. Whatever falls to them by lot will be theirs. Distribute it according to your ancestral tribes.
04Nm 33:55 "'But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will give you trouble in the land where you will live.
04Nm 33:56 And then I will do to you what I plan to do to them.'"
04Nm 34:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 34:2 "Command the Israelites and say to them£º 'When you enter Canaan, the land that will be allotted to you as an inheritance will have these boundaries£º
04Nm 34:3 "'Your southern side will include some of the Desert of Zin along the border of Edom. On the east, your southern boundary will start from the end of the Salt Sea,
04Nm 34:4 cross south of Scorpion Pass, continue on to Zin and go south of Kadesh Barnea. Then it will go to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon,
04Nm 34:5 where it will turn, join the Wadi of Egypt and end at the Sea.
04Nm 34:6 "'Your western boundary will be the coast of the Great Sea. This will be your boundary on the west.
04Nm 34:7 "'For your northern boundary, run a line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor
04Nm 34:8 and from Mount Hor to Lebo Hamath. Then the boundary will go to Zedad,
04Nm 34:9 continue to Ziphron and end at Hazar Enan. This will be your boundary on the north.
04Nm 34:10 "'For your eastern boundary, run a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
04Nm 34:11 The boundary will go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and continue along the slopes east of the Sea of Kinnereth.
04Nm 34:12 Then the boundary will go down along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. "'This will be your land, with its boundaries on every side.'"
04Nm 34:13 Moses commanded the Israelites£º "Assign this land by lot as an inheritance. The LORD has ordered that it be given to the nine and a half tribes,
04Nm 34:14 because the families of the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.
04Nm 34:15 These two and a half tribes have received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan of Jericho, toward the sunrise."
04Nm 34:16 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 34:17 "These are the names of the men who are to assign the land for you as an inheritance£º Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.
04Nm 34:18 And appoint one leader from each tribe to help assign the land.
04Nm 34:19 These are their names£º Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah;
04Nm 34:20 Shemuel son of Ammihud, from the tribe of Simeon;
04Nm 34:21 Elidad son of Kislon, from the tribe of Benjamin;
04Nm 34:22 Bukki son of Jogli, the leader from the tribe of Dan;
04Nm 34:23 Hanniel son of Ephod, the leader from the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph;
04Nm 34:24 Kemuel son of Shiphtan, the leader from the tribe of Ephraim son of Joseph;
04Nm 34:25 Elizaphan son of Parnach, the leader from the tribe of Zebulun;
04Nm 34:26 Paltiel son of Azzan, the leader from the tribe of Issachar;
04Nm 34:27 Ahihud son of Shelomi, the leader from the tribe of Asher;
04Nm 34:28 Pedahel son of Ammihud, the leader from the tribe of Naphtali."
04Nm 34:29 These are the men the LORD commanded to assign the inheritance to the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
04Nm 35:1 On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 35:2 "Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from the inheritance the Israelites will possess. And give them pasturelands around the towns.
04Nm 35:3 Then they will have towns to live in and pasturelands for their cattle, flocks and all their other livestock.
04Nm 35:4 "The pasturelands around the towns that you give the Levites will extend out fifteen hundred feet from the town wall.
04Nm 35:5 Outside the town, measure three thousand feet on the east side, three thousand on the south side, three thousand on the west and three thousand on the north, with the town in the center. They will have this area as pastureland for the towns.
04Nm 35:6 "Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone may flee. In addition, give them forty-two other towns.
04Nm 35:7 In all you must give the Levites forty-eight towns, together with their pasturelands.
04Nm 35:8 The towns you give the Levites from the land the Israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe£º Take many towns from a tribe that has many, but few from one that has few."
04Nm 35:9 Then the LORD said to Moses£º
04Nm 35:10 "Speak to the Israelites and say to them£º 'When you cross the Jordan into Canaan,
04Nm 35:11 select some towns to be your cities of refuge, to which a person who has killed someone accidentally may flee.
04Nm 35:12 They will be places of refuge from the avenger, so that a person accused of murder may not die before he stands trial before the assembly.
04Nm 35:13 These six towns you give will be your cities of refuge.
04Nm 35:14 Give three on this side of the Jordan and three in Canaan as cities of refuge.
04Nm 35:15 These six towns will be a place of refuge for Israelites, aliens and any other people living among them, so that anyone who has killed another accidentally can flee there.
04Nm 35:16 "'If a man strikes someone with an iron object so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.
04Nm 35:17 Or if anyone has a stone in his hand that could kill, and he strikes someone so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.
04Nm 35:18 Or if anyone has a wooden object in his hand that could kill, and he hits someone so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death.
04Nm 35:19 The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death; when he meets him, he shall put him to death.
04Nm 35:20 If anyone with malice aforethought shoves another or throws something at him intentionally so that he dies
04Nm 35:21 or if in hostility he hits him with his fist so that he dies, that person shall be put to death; he is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.
04Nm 35:22 "'But if without hostility someone suddenly shoves another or throws something at him unintentionally
04Nm 35:23 or, without seeing him, drops a stone on him that could kill him, and he dies, then since he was not his enemy and he did not intend to harm him,
04Nm 35:24 the assembly must judge between him and the avenger of blood according to these regulations.
04Nm 35:25 The assembly must protect the one accused of murder from the avenger of blood and send him back to the city of refuge to which he fled. He must stay there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
04Nm 35:26 "'But if the accused ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which he has fled
04Nm 35:27 and the avenger of blood finds him outside the city, the avenger of blood may kill the accused without being guilty of murder.
04Nm 35:28 The accused must stay in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest; only after the death of the high priest may he return to his own property.
04Nm 35:29 "'These are to be legal requirements for you throughout the generations to come, wherever you live.
04Nm 35:30 "'Anyone who kills a person is to be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses. But no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
04Nm 35:31 "'Do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer, who deserves to die. He must surely be put to death.
04Nm 35:32 "'Do not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a city of refuge and so allow him to go back and live on his own land before the death of the high priest.
04Nm 35:33 "'Do not pollute the land where you are. Bloodshed pollutes the land, and atonement cannot be made for the land on which blood has been shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it.
04Nm 35:34 Do not defile the land where you live and where I dwell, for I, the LORD, dwell among the Israelites.'"
04Nm 36:1 The family heads of the clan of Gilead son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, who were from the clans of the descendants of Joseph, came and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families.
04Nm 36:2 They said, "When the LORD commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the Israelites by lot, he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
04Nm 36:3 Now suppose they marry men from other Israelite tribes; then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into. And so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away.
04Nm 36:4 When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our forefathers."
04Nm 36:5 Then at the LORD'S command Moses gave this order to the Israelites£º "What the tribe of the descendants of Joseph is saying is right.
04Nm 36:6 This is what the LORD commands for Zelophehad's daughters£º They may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within the tribal clan of their father.
04Nm 36:7 No inheritance in Israel is to pass from tribe to tribe, for every Israelite shall keep the tribal land inherited from his forefathers.
04Nm 36:8 Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone in her father's tribal clan, so that every Israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers.
04Nm 36:9 No inheritance may pass from tribe to tribe, for each Israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits."
04Nm 36:10 So Zelophehad's daughters did as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 36:11 Zelophehad's daughters--Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah--married their cousins on their father's side.
04Nm 36:12 They married within the clans of the descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in their father's clan and tribe.
04Nm 36:13 These are the commands and regulations the LORD gave through Moses to the Israelites on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
